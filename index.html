      <h1>Romans Bible Study</h1>
      <h2>Author</h2>
      <p>
        Paul, the author, was a Hebrew by descent, a native of Tarsus in
        Cilicia, and educated by Gamaliel, the great Pharisaic teacher. He was
        one of the most unmerciful persecutors of the early Christians, but was
        converted by the sudden appearance to him of the risen Lord. He began
        preaching at Damascus, but on account of persecution went into Arabia.
        Returning from Arabia he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and then went
        to Cilicia, where he doubtless did evangelistic work until Barnabas
        sought him at Tarsus and brought him to Antioch, where he worked a year
        with Barnabas. After this they went up to Jerusalem with contributions
        for the brethren. Upon return to Antioch he was called by the Holy Ghost
        to mission work in which he continued till his death, making at least
        three great missionary journeys, during which and afterward he suffered
        "one long martyrdom" till his death.
      </p>

      <h2>Date</h2>
      <p>
        Paul's epistles are commonly categorized into four groups based on their
        themes and historical context.
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) The Eschatological Group, or those dealing with the second coming of
        Christ, includes 1 and 2 Thessalonians. These letters emphasize the
        return of Christ and the resurrection of believers, providing
        encouragement to persecuted Christians and clarifying misunderstandings
        regarding the "Day of the Lord." They were likely written from Corinth
        during Paul’s second missionary journey around A.D. 50-51.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) The Anti-Judaic (Soteriological) Group, or those written in response
        to conflicts with Judaizing teachers, includes Galatians, 1 and 2
        Corinthians, and Romans. These letters defend justification by faith
        apart from the works of the Mosaic Law and address church divisions,
        immorality, and the role of Israel in God’s redemptive plan. They were
        written during Paul’s third missionary journey (A.D. 53-58) from various
        locations: Galatians from Ephesus or possibly Antioch (A.D. 48-55), 1
        Corinthians from Ephesus (A.D. 54-55), 2 Corinthians from Macedonia
        (A.D. 55-56), and Romans from Corinth (A.D. 57-58).
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) The Christological (Prison) Group, which centers on the character
        and work of Jesus Christ, consists of Ephesians, Philippians,
        Colossians, and Philemon. These letters emphasize Christ’s supremacy,
        the unity of Jew and Gentile in the Church, and encouragement in
        suffering. They were written during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment
        (A.D. 60-62) while under house arrest. Ephesians focuses on the
        believer’s position in Christ, Philippians highlights joy in suffering,
        Colossians defends the supremacy of Christ against false teachings, and
        Philemon is a personal plea for the reconciliation of a runaway slave.
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) The Pastoral Group, written to young church leaders with
        instructions on church organization, governance, and pastoral
        responsibilities, includes 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus. These
        letters provide guidelines for church leadership, warnings against false
        doctrine, and encouragement for perseverance in ministry. 1 Timothy and
        Titus were likely written after Paul’s first Roman imprisonment (A.D.
        63-65), while 2 Timothy, written during his second Roman imprisonment
        (A.D. 66-67), serves as his final exhortation before his execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans, belonging to the Anti-Judaic Group, was likely written from
        Corinth around A.D. 57-58. While this categorization is widely accepted,
        some scholars propose alternative classifications, such as grouping
        certain letters based on captivity, missionary focus, or legal themes.
        Regardless of classification, the content and theological significance
        of Romans remain largely unchanged because it is less context-dependent
        than many of his other letters.
      </p>

      <h2>Audience and Background</h2>
      <p>
        The Church at Rome was doubtless in a very prosperous condition at the
        time of Paul's writing. It was perhaps organized by some Jews who heard
        and believed while at Jerusalem, probably on the day of Pentecost. While
        its membership included both Jews and Gentiles (1:6- 13; 7:1), it was
        regarded by Paul as especially a Gentile church (1:3-7; 13-15).
      </p>
      <p>
        He had never been there up to this time (1:11, 13, 15) and it is not
        likely that any other apostles had been there. For then Paul would have
        not have been planning to go since his rule was not to go where another
        had worked (15:20; 2 Cor. 10:14-16). This strikes a heavy blow at
        Catholicism, claiming that Peter was first bishop of Rome. If Paul would
        not have followed him, then Peter had not been there, and the most
        important test of papacy is overthrown. Paul had, however, many intimate
        friends and acquaintances at Rome, many of whom were mentioned in
        chapter 16. Among them were his old friends, Aquila and Priscilia.
