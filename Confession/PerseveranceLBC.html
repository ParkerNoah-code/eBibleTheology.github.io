      <p><b>Chapter 17. Of the Perseverance of the Saints</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> Those whom God has accepted in the beloved, effectually called
        and sanctified by his Spirit, and given the precious faith of his elect
        unto, can neither totally nor finally fall from the state of grace, but
        shall certainly persevere therein to the end, and be eternally saved,
        seeing the gifts and callings of God are without repentance, from which
        source he still begets and nourishes in them faith, repentance, love,
        joy, hope, and all the graces of the Spirit unto immortality;<sup
          >1</sup
        >
        and though many storms and floods arise and beat against them, yet they
        shall never be able to take them off that foundation and rock which by
        faith they are fastened upon; notwithstanding, through unbelief and the
        temptations of Satan, the sensible sight of the light and love of God
        may for a time be clouded and obscured from them,<sup>2</sup> yet he is
        still the same, and they shall be sure to be kept by the power of God
        unto salvation, where they shall enjoy their purchased possession, they
        being engraved upon the palm of his hands, and their names having been
        written in the book of life from all eternity.<sup>3</sup>

        <b>2.</b> This perseverance of the saints depends not upon their own
        free will, but upon the immutability of the decree of election,<sup

        >
        flowing from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father, upon the
        efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ and union with
        him,<sup>5</sup> the oath of God,<sup>6</sup> the abiding of his Spirit,
        and the seed of God within them,<sup>7</sup> and the nature of the
        covenant of grace;<sup>8</sup>
        from all which ariseth also the certainty and infallibility thereof.

        <b>3.</b> And though they may, through the temptation of Satan and of
        the world, the prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the
        neglect of means of their preservation, fall into grievous sins, and for
        a time continue therein,<sup>9</sup> whereby they incur God&#x27;s
        displeasure and grieve his Holy Spirit,<sup>10</sup> come to have their
        graces and comforts impaired,<sup>11</sup> have their hearts hardened,
        and their consciences wounded,<sup>12</sup> hurt and scandalize others,
        and bring temporal judgments upon themselves,<sup>13</sup> yet shall
        they renew their repentance and be preserved through faith in Christ
        Jesus to the end.<sup>14</sup>
