      <p><b>Chapter 3. Of God's Decree</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> God hath decreed in himself, from all eternity, by the most
        wise and holy counsel of His own will, freely and unchangeably, all
        things, whatsoever comes to pass;<sup>1</sup> yet so as thereby is God
        neither the author of sin nor hath fellowship with any therein;<sup
          >2</sup
        >
        nor is violence offered to the will of the creature, nor yet is the
        liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather
        established;<sup>3</sup> in which appears His wisdom in disposing all
        things, and power and faithfulness in accomplishing His decree.<sup

      <p>
        <b>2.</b> Although God knoweth whatsoever may or can come to pass, upon
        all supposed conditions,<sup>5</sup> yet hath He not decreed anything,
        because He foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass
        upon such conditions.<sup>6</sup>

        <b>3.</b> By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some
        men and angels are predestinated, or foreordained to eternal life
        through Jesus Christ,<sup>7</sup> to the praise of His glorious
        grace;<sup>8</sup> others being left to act in their sin to their just
        condemnation, to the praise of His glorious justice.<sup>9</sup>

      <p>
        <b>4.</b> These angels and men thus predestinated and foreordained, are
        particularly and unchangeably designed, and their number so certain and
        definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished.<sup>10</sup>

        <b>5.</b> Those of mankind that are predestinated to life, God, before
        the foundation of the world was laid, according to His eternal and
        immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of His will,
        hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of His mere free grace
        and love,<sup>11</sup> without any other thing in the creature as a
        condition or cause moving Him thereunto.<sup>12</sup>

        <b>6.</b> As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so He hath, by the
        eternal and most free purpose of His will, foreordained all the means
        thereunto;<sup>13</sup> wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in
        Adam, are redeemed by Christ,<sup>14</sup> are effectually called unto
        faith in Christ, by His Spirit working in due season, are justified,
        adopted, sanctified,<sup>15</sup> and kept by His power through faith
        unto salvation;<sup>16</sup> neither are any other redeemed by Christ,
        or effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but
        the elect only.<sup>17</sup>

        <b>7.</b> The doctrine of the high mystery of predestination is to be
        handled with special prudence and care, that men attending the will of
        God revealed in His Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, may, from
        the certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their eternal
        election;<sup>18</sup> so shall this doctrine afford matter of
        praise,<sup>19</sup> reverence, and admiration of God, and of
        humility,<sup>20</sup> diligence, and abundant consolation to all that
        sincerely obey the gospel.<sup>21</sup>
