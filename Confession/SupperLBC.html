      <p><b>Chapter 30. Of the Lord's Supper</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same
        night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the
        end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the
        world the sacrifice of himself in his death,<sup>1</sup> confirmation of
        the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual
        nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all
        duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their
        communion with him, and with each other.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">
        1. 1 Corinthians 11:23-26
        <br />
        2. 1 Corinthians 10:16-17, 21
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor
        any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or
        dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of himself by himself
        upon the cross, once for all;<sup>3</sup> and a spiritual oblation of
        all possible praise unto God for the same.<sup>4</sup> So that the
        popish sacrifice of the mass, as they call it, is most abominable,
        injurious to Christ&#x27;s own sacrifice the alone propitiation for all
        the sins of the elect.

        <br />
        4. 1 Corinthians 11:24; Matthew 26:26-27
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his
        ministers to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby
        to set them apart from a common to a holy use, and to take and break the
        bread; to take the cup, and, they communicating also themselves, to give
        both to the communicants.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">5. 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, etc.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> The denial of the cup to the people, worshipping the elements,
        the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and reserving
        them for any pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature of
        this ordinance, and to the institution of Christ.<sup>6</sup>
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">6. Matthew 26:26-28, 15:9; Exodus 20:4-5</p>
      <p>
        <b>5.</b> The outward elements in this ordinance, duly set apart to the
        use ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that
        truly, although in terms used figuratively, they are sometimes called by
        the names of the things they represent, in other words, the body and
        blood of Christ,<sup>7</sup> albeit, in substance and nature, they still
        remain truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.<sup>8</sup>

        8. 1 Corinthians 11:26-28
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6.</b> That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of
        bread and wine, into the substance of Christ&#x27;s body and blood,
        commonly called transubstantiation, by consecration of a priest, or by
        any other way, is repugnant not to Scripture alone,<sup>9</sup> but even
        to common sense and reason, overthrows the nature of the ordinance, and
        has been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions, yea, of gross
        idolatries.<sup>10</sup>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7.</b> Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements
        in this ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed,
        yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon
        Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood
        of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present
        to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves
        are to their outward senses.<sup>11</sup>

      <p>
        <b>8.</b> All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy
        communion with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lord&#x27;s table,
        and cannot, without great sin against him, while they remain such,
        partake of these holy mysteries, or be admitted thereunto;<sup>12</sup>
        yea, whosoever shall receive unworthily, are guilty of the body and
        blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to themselves.<sup
