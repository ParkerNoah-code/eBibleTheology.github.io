      <p><b>Chapter 13. Of Sanctification</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> They who are united to Christ, effectually called, and
        regenerated, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them through
        the virtue of Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection, are also farther
        sanctified, really and personally,<sup>1</sup> through the same virtue,
        by his Word and Spirit dwelling in them;<sup>2</sup> the dominion of the
        whole body of sin is destroyed,<sup>3</sup> and the several lusts of it
        are more and more weakened and mortified,<sup>4</sup> and they more and
        more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces,<sup>5</sup> to the
        practice of all true holiness, without which no man shall see the
        Lord.<sup>6</sup>

        <b>2.</b> This sanctification is throughout the whole man,<sup>7</sup>
        yet imperfect in this life; there abides still some remnants of
        corruption in every part,<sup>8</sup> wherefrom arises a continual and
        irreconcilable war; the flesh lusting against the Spirit, and the Spirit
        against the flesh.<sup>9</sup>

        <b>3.</b> In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may
        much prevail,<sup>10</sup> yet, through the continual supply of strength
        from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part does
        overcome;<sup>11</sup> and so the saints grow in grace, perfecting
        holiness in the fear of God, pressing after an heavenly life, in
        evangelical obedience to all the commands which Christ as Head and King,
        in his Word has prescribed to them.<sup>12</sup>
