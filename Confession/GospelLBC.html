      <p><b>Chapter 20. Of the Gospel and the Extent of Grace thereof</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> The covenant of works being broken by sin, and made
        unprofitable unto life, God was pleased to give forth the promise of
        Christ, the seed of the woman, as the means of calling the elect, and
        begetting in them faith and repentance;<sup>1</sup> in this promise the
        gospel, as to the substance of it, was revealed, and [is] therein
        effectual for the conversion and salvation of sinners.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Genesis 3:15
        <br />
        2. Revelation 13:8
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only
        by the Word of God;<sup>3</sup> neither do the works of creation or
        providence, with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of
        grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way;<sup>4</sup> much
        less that men destitute of the revelation of Him by the promise or
        gospel, should be enabled thereby to attain saving faith or
        repentance.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Romans 1:17
        <br />
        4. Romans 10:14-15, 17
        <br />
        5. Proverbs 29:18; Isaiah 25:7, 60:2-3
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> The revelation of the gospel to sinners, made in divers times
        and by sundry parts, with the addition of promises and precepts for the
        obedience required therein, as to the nations and persons to whom it is
        granted, is merely of the sovereign will and good pleasure of God;<sup
          >6</sup
        >
        not being annexed by virtue of any promise to the due improvement of
        men&#x27;s natural abilities, by virtue of common light received without
        it, which none ever made, or can do so;<sup>7</sup> and therefore in all
        ages, the preaching of the gospel has been granted unto persons and
        nations, as to the extent or straitening of it, in great variety,
        according to the counsel of the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Psalms 147:20; Acts 16:7
        <br />
        7. Romans 1:18-32
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> Although the gospel be the only outward means of revealing
        Christ and saving grace, and is, as such, abundantly sufficient
        thereunto; yet that men who are dead in trespasses may be born again,
        quickened or regenerated, there is moreover necessary an effectual
        insuperable work of the Holy Spirit upon the whole soul, for the
        producing in them a new spiritual life;<sup>8</sup> without which no
        other means will effect their conversion unto God.<sup>9</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Psalms 110:3; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Ephesians 1:19-20
        <br />
        9. John 6:44; 2 Corinthians 4:4, 6
