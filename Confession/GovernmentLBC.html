      <p><b>Chapter 24. Of the Civil magistrate</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> God, the supreme Lord and King of all the world, has ordained
        civil magistrates to be under him, over the people, for his own glory
        and the public good; and to this end has armed them with the power of
        the sword, for defence and encouragement of them that do good, and for
        the punishment of evil doers.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>1. Romans 13:1-4</p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the office
        of a magistrate when called thereunto; in the management whereof, as
        they ought especially to maintain justice and peace,<sup>3</sup>
        according to the wholesome laws of each kingdom and commonwealth, so for
        that end they may lawfully now, under the New Testament, wage war upon
        just and necessary occasions.<sup>4</sup>

        <br />
        4. Luke 3:14
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> Civil magistrates being set up by God for the ends aforesaid;
        subjection, in all lawful things commanded by them, ought to be yielded
        by us in the Lord, not only for wrath, but for conscienceâ€™ sake;<sup
          >5</sup
        >
        and we ought to make supplications and prayers for kings and all that
        are in authority, that under them we may live a quiet and peaceable
        life, in all godliness and honesty.<sup>6</sup>
