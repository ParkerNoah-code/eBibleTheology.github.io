      <p><b>Chapter 27. Of the Communion of Saints</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> All saints that are united to Jesus Christ, their head, by his
        Spirit, and faith, although they are not made thereby one person with
        him, have fellowship in his graces, sufferings, death, resurrection, and
        glory;<sup>1</sup> and, being united to one another in love, they have
        communion in each others gifts and graces,<sup>2</sup> and are obliged
        to the performance of such duties, public and private, in an orderly
        way, as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward
        man.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> Saints by profession are bound to maintain a holy fellowship
        and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other
        spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification;<sup>4</sup> as
        also in relieving each other in outward things according to their
        several abilities, and necessities;<sup>5</sup> which communion,
        according to the rule of the gospel, though especially to be exercised
        by them, in the relation wherein they stand, whether in families,<sup
          >6</sup
        >
        or churches,<sup>7</sup> yet, as God offers opportunity, is to be
        extended to all the household of faith, even all those who in every
        place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus; nevertheless their communion
        one with another as saints, does not take away or infringe the title or
        propriety which each man has in his goods and possessions.<sup>8</sup>
