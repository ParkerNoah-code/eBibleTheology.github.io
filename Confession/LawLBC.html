      <p><b>Chapter 19. Of the Law of God</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> God gave to Adam a law of universal obedience written in his
        heart, and a particular precept of not eating the fruit of the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil;<sup>1</sup> by which he bound him and all
        his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience;<sup
          >2</sup
        >
        promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach
        of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">1. Genesis 1:27; Ecclesiastes 7:29</p>
      <p class="not-indented">2. Romans 10:5</p>
      <p class="not-indented">3. Galatians 3:10, 12</p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> The same law that was first written in the heart of man
        continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness after the fall,<sup
          >4</sup
        >
        and was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in ten commandments, and
        written in two tables, the four first containing our duty towards God,
        and the other six, our duty to man.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">4. Romans 2:14-15</p>
      <p class="not-indented">5. Deuteronomy 10:4</p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> Besides this law, commonly called moral, God was pleased to
        give to the people of Israel ceremonial laws, containing several typical
        ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, his graces, actions,
        sufferings, and benefits;<sup>6</sup> and partly holding forth divers
        instructions of moral duties,<sup>7</sup> all which ceremonial laws
        being appointed only to the time of reformation, are, by Jesus Christ
        the true Messiah and only law-giver, who was furnished with power from
        the Father for that end abrogated and taken away.<sup>8</sup>

        <b>4.</b> To them also he gave sundry judicial laws, which expired
        together with the state of that people, not obliging any now by virtue
        of that institution; their general equity only being of moral use.<sup
          >9</sup
        >
      </p>
      <p>9. 1 Corinthians 9:8-10</p>
      <p>
        <b>5.</b> The moral law does for ever bind all, as well justified
        persons as others, to the obedience thereof,<sup>10</sup> and that not
        only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the
        authority of God the Creator, who gave it;<sup>11</sup> neither does
        Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen this
        obligation.<sup>12</sup>

      <p class="not-indented">12. Matthew 5:17-19; Romans 3:31</p>
      <p>
        <b>6.</b> Although true believers are not under the law as a covenant of
        works, to be thereby justified or condemned,<sup>13</sup> yet it is of
        great use to them as well as to others, in that as a rule of life,
        informing them of the will of God and their duty, it directs and binds
        them to walk accordingly; discovering also the sinful pollutions of
        their natures, hearts, and lives, so as examining themselves thereby,
        they may come to further conviction of, humiliation for, and hatred
        against, sin;<sup>14</sup> together with a clearer sight of the need
        they have of Christ and the perfection of his obedience; it is likewise
        of use to the regenerate to restrain their corruptions, in that it
        forbids sin; and the threatenings of it serve to show what even their
        sins deserve, and what afflictions in this life they may expect for
        them, although freed from the curse and unallayed rigour thereof. The
        promises of it likewise show them God&#x27;s approbation of obedience,
        and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, though
        not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works; so as man&#x27;s
        doing good and refraining from evil, because the law encourages to the
        one and deters from the other, is no evidence of his being under the law
        and not under grace.<sup>15</sup>

      <p>
        <b>7.</b> Neither are the aforementioned uses of the law contrary to the
        grace of the Gospel, but do sweetly comply with it,<sup>16</sup> the
        Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to do that freely
        and cheerfully which the will of God, revealed in the law, requires to
        be done.<sup>17</sup>
