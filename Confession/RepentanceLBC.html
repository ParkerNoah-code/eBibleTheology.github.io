      <p><b>Chapter 15. Of Repentance Unto Life and Salvation</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> Such of the elect that are converted at riper years, having
        sometime lived in the state of nature, and therein served divers
        pleasures, God in their effectual calling gives them repentance to
        life.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">1. Titus 3:2-5</p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> Whereas there is none that does good and does not sin,<sup
          >2</sup
        >
        and the best of men may, through the power and deceitfulness of their
        corruption dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall in
        to great sins and provocations; God has, in the covenant of grace,
        mercifully provided that believers so sinning and falling be renewed
        through repentance unto salvation.<sup>3</sup>

      <p class="not-indented">3. Luke 22:31-32</p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> This saving repentance is an evangelical grace,<sup>4</sup>
        whereby a person, being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold
        evils of his sin, does, by faith in Christ, humble himself for it with
        godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrancy,<sup>5</sup>
        praying for pardon and strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavor,
        by supplies of the Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleasing in
        all things.<sup>6</sup>

      <p class="not-indented">6. Psalms 119:6, 128</p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> As repentance is to be continued through the whole course of
        our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions
        thereof, so it is every manâ€™s duty to repent of his particular known
        sins particularly.<sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">7. Luke 19:8; 1 Timothy 1:13, 15</p>
      <p>
        <b>5.</b> Such is the provision which God has made through Christ in the
        covenant of grace for the preservation of believers unto salvation, that
        although there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation,<sup>8</sup>
        yet there is no sin so great that it shall bring damnation to them that
        repent,<sup>9</sup>
        which makes the constant preaching of repentance necessary.
