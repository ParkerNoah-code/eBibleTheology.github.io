      <p><b>Chapter 9. Of Free Will</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> God has endued the will of man with that natural liberty and
        power of acting upon choice, that it is neither forced, nor by any
        necessity of nature determined to do good or evil.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>1. Matthew 17:12; James 1:14; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will
        and to do that which was good and well-pleasing to God,<sup>2</sup> but
        yet was unstable, so that he might fall from it.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Ecclesiastes 7:29
        <br />
        3. Genesis 3:6
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> Man, by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all
        ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation;<sup
          >4</sup
        >
        so as a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in
        sin,<sup>5</sup> is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or
        to prepare himself thereunto.<sup>6</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Romans 5:6, 8:7
        <br />
        5. Ephesians 2:1, 5
        <br />
        6. Titus 3:3-5; John 6:44
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state
        of grace, He frees him from his natural bondage under sin,<sup>7</sup>
        and by His grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which
        is spiritually good;<sup>8</sup> yet so as that by reason of his
        remaining corruptions, he does not perfectly, nor only will, that which
        is good, but does also will that which is evil.<sup>9</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Colossians 1:13; John 8:36
        <br />
        8. Philippians 2:13
        <br />
        9. Romans 7:15, 18-19, 21, 23
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.</b> This will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to good
        alone in the state of glory only.<sup>10</sup>
      </p>
      <p>10. Ephesians 4:13</p>
