      <p><b>Chapter 16. Of Good Works</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> Good works are only such as God has commanded in his Holy
        Word,<sup>1</sup> and not such as without the warrant thereof are
        devised by men out of blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good
        intentions.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Micah 6:8; Hebrews 13:21
        <br />
        2. Matthew 15:9; Isaiah 29:13
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> These good works, done in obedience to God’s commandments, are
        the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith;<sup>3</sup> and by
        them believers manifest their thankfulness,<sup>4</sup> strengthen their
        assurance,<sup>5</sup> edify their brethren, adorn the profession of the
        gospel,<sup>6</sup> stop the mouths of the adversaries, and glory
        God,<sup>7</sup> whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus
        thereunto,<sup>8</sup> that having their fruit unto holiness they may
        have the end eternal life.<sup>9</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        3. James 2:18, 22
        <br />
        4. Psalms 116:12-13
        <br />
        5. 1 John 2:3, 5; 2 Peter 1:5-11
        <br />
        6. Matthew 5:16
        <br />
        7. 1 Timothy 6:1; 1 Peter 2:15; Philemon 1:11
        <br />
        8. Ephesians 2:10
        <br />
        9. Romans 6:22
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> Their ability to do good works is not all of themselves, but
        wholly from the Spirit of Christ;<sup>10</sup> and that they may be
        enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there
        is necessary an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in
        them and to will and to do of his good pleasure;<sup>11</sup> yet they
        are not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform
        any duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit, but they ought to
        be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.<sup

      </p>
      <p>
        10. John 15:4-5
        <br />
        11. 2 Corinthians 3:5; Philippians 2:13
        <br />
        12. Philippians 2:12; Hebrews 6:11, 12; Isaiah 64:7
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height
        which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to
        supererogate, and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short
        of much which in duty they are bound to do.<sup>13</sup>
      </p>
      <p>13. Job 9:2-3; Galatians 5:17; Luke 17:10</p>
      <p>
        <b>5.</b> We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin or eternal
        life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is
        between them and the glory to come, and the infinite distance that is
        between us and God, whom by them we can neither profit nor satisfy for
        the debt of our former sins;<sup>14</sup> but when we have done all we
        can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants; and
        because they are good they proceed from his Spirit,<sup>15</sup> and as
        they are wrought by us they are defiled and mixed with so much weakness
        and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of God’s
        punishment.<sup>16</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        14. Romans 3:20; Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 4:6
        <br />
        15. Galatians 5:22-23
        <br />
        16. Isaiah 64:6; Psalms 43:2
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6.</b> Yet notwithstanding the persons of believers being accepted
        through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him;<sup>17</sup>
        not as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable
        in God’s sight, but that he, looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to
        accept and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with many
        weaknesses and imperfections.<sup>18</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        17. Ephesians 1:5; 1 Peter 1:5
        <br />
        18. Matthew 25:21, 23; Hebrews 6:10
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7.</b> Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of
        them they may things which God commands, and of good use both to
        themselves and to others;<sup>19</sup> yet because they proceed not from
        a heart purified by faith,<sup>20</sup> nor are done in a right manner
        according to the Word,<sup>21</sup> nor to a right end, the glory of
        God,<sup>22</sup> they are therfore sinful, and cannot please God, nor
        make a man meet to receive the grace from God,<sup>23</sup> and yet
        their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing to God.<sup
