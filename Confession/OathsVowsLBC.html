      <p><b>Chapter 23. Of Lawful Oaths and Vows</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> A lawful oath is a part of religious worship, wherein the
        person swearing in truth, righteousness, and judgment, solemnly calls
        God to witness what he swears,<sup>1</sup> and to judge him according to
        the truth or falseness thereof.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Exodus 20:7; Deuteronomy 10:20; Jeremiah 4:2
        <br />
        2. 2 Chronicles 6:22-23
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear; and
        therein it is to be used, with all holy fear and reverence; therefore to
        swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name, or to swear
        at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred;<sup>3</sup>
        yet as in matter of weight and moment, for confirmation of truth, and
        ending all strife, an oath is warranted by the word of God;<sup>4</sup>
        so a lawful oath being imposed by lawful authority in such matters,
        ought to be taken.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Matthew 5:34, 37; James 5:12
        <br />
        4. Hebrews 6:16; 2 Corinthians 1:23
        <br />
        5. Nehemiah 13:25
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3.</b> Whosoever takes an oath warranted by the word of God, ought
        duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act, and therein to
        avouch nothing but what he knows to be truth; for that by rash, false,
        and vain oaths, the Lord is provoked, and for them this land mourns.<sup

      </p>
      <p>6. Leviticus 19:12; Jeremiah 23:10</p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the
        words, without equivocation or mental reservation.<sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p>7. Psalms 24:4</p>
      <p>
        <b>5.</b> A vow, which is not to be made to any creature, but to God
        alone, is to be made and performed with all religious care and
        faithfulness;<sup>8</sup> but popish monastical vows of perpetual single
        life,<sup>9</sup> professed poverty,<sup>10</sup> and regular obedience,
        are so far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are
        superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian may entangle
        himself.<sup>11</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Psalms 76:11; Genesis 28:20-22

        9. 1 Corinthians 7:2, 9
        <br />
        10. Ephesians 4:28
        <br />
        11. Matthew 19:1
