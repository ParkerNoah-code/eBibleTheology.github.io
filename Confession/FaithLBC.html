      <p><b>Chapter 14. Of Saving Faith</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe
        to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in
        their hearts,<sup>1</sup> and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of
        the Word;<sup>2</sup> by which also, and by the administration of
        baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper, prayer, and other means appointed of
        God, it is increased and strengthened.<sup>3</sup>

      <p class="not-indented">3. Luke 17:5; 1 Peter 2:2; Acts 20:32</p>
      <p>
        <b>2.</b> By this faith a Christian believes to be true whatsoever is
        revealed in the Word for the authority of God himself,<sup>4</sup> and
        also apprehends an excellency therein above all other writings and all
        things in the world,<sup>5</sup> as it bears forth the glory of God in
        his attributes, the excellency of Christ in his nature and offices, and
        the power and fullness of the Holy Spirit in his workings and
        operations: and so is enabled to cast his soul upon the truth
        consequently believed;<sup>6</sup> and also acts differently upon that
        which each particular passage thereof contains; yielding obedience to
        the commands,<sup>7</sup> trembling at the threatenings,<sup>8</sup> and
        embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to
        come;<sup>9</sup> but the principle acts of saving faith have immediate
        relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, and resting upon him alone for
        justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the
        covenant of grace.<sup>10</sup>

      <p>
        <b>3.</b> This faith, although it be in different stages, and may be
        weak or strong,<sup>11</sup> yet it is in the least degree of it
        different in the kind or nature of it, as is all other saving grace,
        from the faith and common grace of temporary believers;<sup>12</sup> and
        therefore, though it may be many times assailed and weakened, yet it
        gets the victory,<sup>13</sup> growing up in many to the attainment of a
        full assurance through Christ,<sup>14</sup> who is both the author and
        finisher of our faith.<sup>15</sup>
