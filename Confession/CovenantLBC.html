      <p><b>Chapter 7. Of God's Covenant</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> The distance between God and the creature is so great, that
        although reasonable creatures do owe obedience to him as their creator,
        yet they could never have attained the reward of life but by some
        voluntary condescension on God&#x27;s part, which he hath been pleased
        to express by way of covenant.<sup>1</sup>

        <b>2.</b> Moreover, man having brought himself under the curse of the
        law by his fall, it pleased the Lord to make a covenant of grace,<sup
          >2</sup
        >
        wherein He freely offers unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus
        Christ, requiring of them faith in Him, that they may be saved;<sup
          >3</sup
        >
        and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto eternal
        life, His Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe.<sup

        <b>3.</b> This covenant is revealed in the gospel; first of all to Adam
        in the promise of salvation by the seed of the woman,<sup>5</sup> and
        afterwards by farther steps, until the full discovery thereof was
        completed in the New Testament;<sup>6</sup> and it is founded in that
        eternal covenant transaction that was between the Father and the Son
        about the redemption of the elect;<sup>7</sup> and it is alone by the
        grace of this covenant that all the posterity of fallen Adam that ever
        were saved did obtain life and blessed immortality, man being now
        utterly incapable of acceptance with God upon those terms on which Adam
        stood in his state of innocency.<sup>8</sup>
