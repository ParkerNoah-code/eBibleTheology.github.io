      <p><b>Chapter 21. Of Christian Liberty and Liberty of Conscience</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> The liberty which Christ has purchased for believers under the
        gospel, consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning
        wrath of God, the severity and curse of the law,<sup>1</sup> and in
        their being delivered from this present evil world,<sup>2</sup> bondage
        to Satan,<sup>3</sup> and dominion of sin,<sup>4</sup> from the evil of
        afflictions,<sup>5</sup> the fear and sting of death, the victory of the
        grave,<sup>6</sup> and everlasting damnation:<sup>7</sup> as also in
        their free access to God, and their yielding obedience unto Him, not out
        of slavish fear,<sup>8</sup> but a child-like love and willing mind.<sup

      </p>
      <p>
        All which were common also to believers under the law for the substance
        of them;<sup>10</sup> but under the New Testament the liberty of
        Christians is further enlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of a
        ceremonial law, to which the Jewish church was subjected, and in greater
        boldness of access to the throne of grace, and in fuller communications
        of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily
        partake of.<sup>11</sup>

        <b>2.</b> God alone is Lord of the conscience,<sup>12</sup> and has left
        it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in any
        thing contrary to his word, or not contained in it.<sup>13</sup> So that
        to believe such doctrines, or obey such commands out of conscience, is
        to betray true liberty of conscience;<sup>14</sup> and the requiring of
        an implicit faith, an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy
        liberty of conscience and reason also.<sup>15</sup>

        <b>3.</b> They who upon pretence of Christian liberty do practice any
        sin, or cherish any sinful lust, as they do thereby pervert the main
        design of the grace of the gospel to their own destruction,<sup>16</sup>
        so they wholly destroy the end of Christian liberty, which is, that
        being delivered out of the hands of all our enemies, we might serve the
        Lord without fear, in holiness and righeousness before Him, all the days
        of our lives.<sup>17</sup>
