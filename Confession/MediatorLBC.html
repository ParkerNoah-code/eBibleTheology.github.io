      <p><b>Chapter 8. Of Christ the Mediator</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain
        the Lord Jesus, His only begotten Son, according to the covenant made
        between them both, to be the mediator between God and man;<sup>1</sup>
        the prophet,<sup>2</sup> priest,<sup>3</sup> and king;<sup>4</sup> head
        and savior of the church,<sup>5</sup> the heir of all things,<sup
          >6</sup
        >
        and judge of the world;<sup>7</sup> unto whom He did from all eternity
        give a people to be His seed and to be by Him in time redeemed, called,
        justified, sanctified, and glorified.<sup>8</sup>

        <b>2.</b> The Son of God, the second person in the Holy Trinity, being
        very and eternal God, the brightness of the Father&#x27;s glory, of one
        substance and equal with Him who made the world, who upholds and governs
        all things He has made, did, when the fullness of time was complete,
        take upon Him man&#x27;s nature, with all the essential properties and
        common infirmities of it,<sup>9</sup> yet without sin;<sup>10</sup>
        being conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary, the
        Holy Spirit coming down upon her: and the power of the Most High
        overshadowing her; and so was made of a woman of the tribe of Judah, of
        the seed of Abraham and David according to the Scriptures;<sup>11</sup>
        so that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures were inseparably joined
        together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion;
        which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only mediator
        between God and man.<sup>12</sup>

      <p>
        <b>3.</b> The Lord Jesus, in His human nature thus united to the divine,
        in the person of the Son, was sanctified and anointed with the Holy
        Spirit above measure,<sup>13</sup> having in Him all the treasures of
        wisdom and knowledge;<sup>14</sup> in whom it pleased the Father that
        all fullness should dwell,<sup>15</sup> to the end that being holy,
        harmless, undefiled,<sup>16</sup> and full of grace and truth,<sup
          >17</sup
        >
        He might be throughly furnished to execute the office of mediator and
        surety;<sup>18</sup> which office He took not upon himself, but was
        thereunto called by His Father;<sup>19</sup> who also put all power and
        judgement in His hand, and gave Him commandment to execute the same.<sup

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4.</b> This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake,<sup
          >21</sup
        >
        which that He might discharge He was made under the law,<sup>22</sup>
        and did perfectly fulfill it, and underwent the punishment due to us,
        which we should have born and suffered,<sup>23</sup> being made sin and
        a curse for us;<sup>24</sup> enduring most grievous sorrows in His soul,
        and most painful sufferings in His body;<sup>25</sup> was crucified, and
        died, and remained in the state of the dead, yet saw no corruption:<sup
          >26</sup
        >
        on the third day He arose from the dead<sup>27</sup> with the same body
        in which He suffered,<sup>28</sup> with which He also ascended into
        heaven,<sup>29</sup> and there sits at the right hand of His Father
        making intercession,<sup>30</sup> and shall return to judge men and
        angels at the end of the world.<sup>31</sup>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5.</b> The Lord Jesus, by His perfect obedience and sacrifice of
        Himself, which He through the eternal Spirit once offered up to God, has
        fully satisfied the justice of God,<sup>32</sup> procured
        reconciliation, and purchased an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom
        of heaven, for all those whom the Father has given unto Him.<sup

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6.</b> Although the price of redemption was not actually paid by
        Christ until after His incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and
        benefit thereof were communicated to the elect in all ages, successively
        from the beginning of the world, in and by those promises, types, and
        sacrifices wherein He was revealed, and signified to be the seed which
        should bruise the serpent&#x27;s head;<sup>34</sup> and the Lamb slain
        from the foundation of the world,<sup>35</sup> being the same yesterday,
        and today and for ever.<sup>36</sup>

        36. Hebrews 13:8
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7.</b> Christ, in the work of mediation, acts according to both
        natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself; yet by
        reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is
        sometimes in Scripture, attributed to the person denominated by the
        other nature.<sup>37</sup>
      </p>
      <p>37. John 3:13; Acts 20:28</p>
      <p>
        <b>8.</b> To all those for whom Christ has obtained eternal redemption,
        He does certainly and effectually apply and communicate the same, making
        intercession for them;<sup>38</sup> uniting them to Himself by His
        Spirit, revealing to them, in and by His Word, the mystery of salvation,
        persuading them to believe and obey,<sup>39</sup> governing their hearts
        by His Word and Spirit,<sup>40</sup> and overcoming all their enemies by
        His almighty power and wisdom,<sup>41</sup> in such manner and ways as
        are most consonant to His wonderful and unsearchable dispensation; and
        all of free and absolute grace, without any condition foreseen in them
        to procure it.<sup>42</sup>

        42. John 3:8; Ephesians 1:8
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>9.</b> This office of mediator between God and man is proper only to
        Christ, who is the prophet, priest, and king of the church of God; and
        may not be either in whole, or any part thereof, transferred from Him to
        any other.<sup>43</sup>
      </p>
      <p>43. 1 Timothy 2:5</p>
      <p>
        <b>10.</b> This number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect
        of our ignorance, we stand in need of His prophetical office;<sup
          >44</sup
        >
        and in respect of our alienation from God, and imperfection of the best
        of our services, we need His priestly office to reconcile us and present
        us acceptable unto God;<sup>45</sup> and in respect to our averseness
        and utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue and security
        from our spiritual adversaries, we need His kingly office to convince,
        subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to His heavenly
        kingdom.<sup>46</sup>
