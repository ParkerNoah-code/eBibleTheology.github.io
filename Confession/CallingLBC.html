      <p><b>Chapter 10. Of Effectual Calling</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>1.</b> Those whom God hath predestinated unto life, He is pleased in
        His appointed, and accepted time, effectually to call,<sup>1</sup> by
        His Word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they
        are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ;<sup>2</sup>
        enlightening their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the
        things of God;<sup>3</sup> taking away their heart of stone, and giving
        to them a heart of flesh;<sup>4</sup> renewing their wills, and by His
        almighty power determining them to that which is good, and effectually
        drawing them to Jesus Christ;<sup>5</sup> yet so as they come most
        freely, being made willing by His grace.<sup>6</sup>

        <b>2.</b> This effectual call is of God&#x27;s free and special grace
        alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man, nor from any power or
        agency in the creature,<sup>7</sup> being wholly passive therein, being
        dead in sins and trespasses, until being quickened and renewed by the
        Holy Spirit;<sup>8</sup> he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and
        to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it, and that by no less
        power than that which raised up Christ from the dead.<sup>9</sup>

        how He pleases;<sup>11</sup>
        so also are all elect persons, who are incapable of being outwardly
        called by the ministry of the Word.

        Spirit,<sup>12</sup> yet not being effectually drawn by the Father, they
        neither will nor can truly come to Christ, and therefore cannot be
        saved:<sup>13</sup> much less can men that do not receive the Christian
        religion be saved; be they never so diligent to frame their lives
        according to the light of nature and the law of that religion they do
        profess.<sup>14</sup>
