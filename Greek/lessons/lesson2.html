<h1>Lesson 2: First Declension Nouns & Article</h1>
<p>
  This chapter focuses on first declension nouns in Koine Greek, a group of
  nouns that share similar patterns of inflection. Most first declension nouns
  are feminine, though a few masculine exceptions exist. These exceptions, such
  as νεανίας ("young man") and προφήτης ("prophet"), are not the main focus here
  and will be discussed elsewhere.
</p>

<h2>Purpose and Structure</h2>
<p>The approach in this chapter is threefold:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Morphological:</strong> What the noun looks like (form and endings)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Syntactic:</strong> What the noun does in a sentence (subject,
    object, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Functional:</strong> How the noun works in context (especially in
    the New Testament)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grammatical Concepts</h2>
<p>
  To study first declension nouns, we need to understand some basic features of
  Greek nouns:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Number:</strong> singular (one) or plural (more than one)</li>
  <li><strong>Gender:</strong> this chapter focuses on feminine nouns</li>
  <li><strong>Case:</strong> shows the noun's role in the sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Greek has five cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Nominative:</strong> subject or subject complement</li>
  <li><strong>Genitive:</strong> shows possession or origin</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dative:</strong> indicates the indirect object, means, or location
  </li>
  <li><strong>Accusative:</strong> direct object or extent</li>
  <li><strong>Vocative:</strong> used for direct address</li>
</ol>
<p>
  I'm mentioning the vocative case here but it will not be discussed in detail
  because it appears less often and plays a limited role. Some even see it as a
  function of the nominative case rather than being a separate case of its own.
</p>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify first declension feminine nouns by their endings</li>
  <li>Parse their forms (break down stem, case, number, and gender)</li>
  <li>Understand their function in biblical texts in a broad way</li>
  <li>Identify and translate them in example passages</li>
</ul>

<h1>Morphology</h1>
<h2>η-Type and α-Type</h2>
<p>
  First declension nouns in Koine Greek form a coherent morphological group
  characterized by shared inflectional patterns. The key feature that defines
  this declension is the modification of word endings, known as case endings, to
  indicate grammatical case and number. While all first declension nouns follow
  the same general system, two major subtypes emerge based on the final vowel of
  the stem: the η-type and the α-type. These subtypes are not separate
  declensions but represent variations within the first declension pattern.
</p>
<p>
  The η-type is marked by the presence of the vowel η in the nominative singular
  form. Nouns of this type typically maintain the η throughout the singular
  paradigm. Examples include words like ζωή ("life"), φωνή ("voice"), and γραφή
  ("scripture").
</p>
<p>
  The α-type, on the other hand, features the vowel α in the nominative
  singular. This group includes nouns such as καρδία ("heart"), βασιλεία
  ("kingdom"), and ἀλήθεια ("truth").
</p>
<p>
  Although the first declension exhibits a high degree of regularity, certain
  nouns demonstrate minor irregularities in their stem formation or vowel usage.
  Two noteworthy examples include δόξα ("glory") and γῆ ("land" or "earth"). The
  irregularity tends to show up in the genitive and dative singular. Despite
  these deviations, it is important to emphasize that the accompanying definite
  article in Greek always retains its regular and predictable form, providing a
  reliable syntactic anchor regardless of noun irregularity.
</p>

<p>The case endings for the two types can be summarized as follows:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Case</th>
      <th>Singular (η-type)</th>
      <th>Singular (α-type)</th>
      <th>Plural (Both Types)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Nominative</td>
      <td>-η</td>
      <td>-α</td>
      <td>-αι</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Genitive</td>
      <td>-ης</td>
      <td>-ας</td>
      <td>-ῶν</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dative</td>
      <td>-ῃ</td>
      <td>-ᾳ</td>
      <td>-αις</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accusative</td>
      <td>-ην</td>
      <td>-αν</td>
      <td>-ᾱς</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The article remains absolutely regular across all first declension nouns,
  whether they follow η-type, α-type, or even irregular patterns like γῆ or
  δόξα. Thus the feminine article agrees with its noun in case and number,
  providing a reliable grammatical guide even when noun forms vary.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Case</th>
      <th>Singular</th>
      <th>Plural</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Nominative</td>
      <td>ἡ</td>
      <td>αἱ</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Genitive</td>
      <td>τῆς</td>
      <td>τῶν</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dative</td>
      <td>τῇ</td>
      <td>ταῖς</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accusative</td>
      <td>τὴν</td>
      <td>τὰς</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h1>Syntax</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The function of a noun within a sentence is primarily indicated by its case.
  Each case conveys a different syntactic role, allowing Greek to express
  relationships between words largely through morphology rather than word order.
  Although the morphological endings differ slightly between η-type and α-type
  nouns, the functions of the cases remain the same across both.
</p>
<p>
  Through these syntactic roles, the Greek case system enables precise and
  flexible expression. First declension nouns, by means of their case endings,
  take on a variety of grammatical functions that must be interpreted in light
  of context, article usage, and accompanying verbs or prepositions. This
  section outlines the core syntactic uses of each case.
</p>
<p>
  The following introduces several case functions which we will come back to in
  more detail later. Right now a basic understanding of the cases and the
  ability to parse the nouns in this chapter is the most important.
</p>

<h2>Nominative Case</h2>
<p>
  The nominative is the case of the subject. It marks the noun that performs the
  action of a finite verb or exists in a particular state or condition. It is
  also used for the subject complement in equative (linking) constructions,
  particularly with the verb εἰμί ("to be").
</p>
<p>
  Example: ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ζωή — “I am the life” (John 11:25). In this example, ἐγώ
  ("I") is the singular nominative pronoun functioning as the subject of the
  verb εἰμι ("I am"), and ἡ ζωή ("the life") is a nominative noun serving as the
  predicate nominative or subject complement, equating the subject with its
  defining quality or identity.
</p>
<p>
  Nouns in the nominative may also appear in appositional constructions, where
  two nominative elements refer to the same entity, often for clarification or
  emphasis (e.g. "My neighbor, Bob, is out of town").
</p>

<h2>Genitive Case</h2>
<p>
  The genitive broadly expresses the idea of relationship. Its primary syntactic
  function is to qualify or limit another noun, frequently indicating possession
  (e.g., "of someone/something"). However, its range is extensive, encompassing
  several types of relations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Possession: τῆς καρδίας — “of the heart”</li>
  <li>Source or origin: ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ — “the word of God”</li>
  <li>Description or quality: συνείδησις ἀγαθῆς — “a good conscience”</li>
  <li>Separation or removal: ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς — “from the earth”</li>
  <li>
    Agency (in passive constructions): ἐπαινεῖται ὑπὸ τῶν μαθητῶν — “is praised
    by the disciples”
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It often appears with prepositions such as ἐκ ("out of"), ἀπό ("from"), and
  διά ("through" when indicating agency or cause).
</p>
<p>
  Example: εὐλογημένος ὁ καρπὸς τῆς κοιλίας σου — "blessed is the fruit of your
  womb" (Luke 1:42). The second declension noun καρπός (masculine nominative
  singular) is the subject, meaning “fruit” or “child,” referring to Jesus. The
  words τῆς κοιλίας come from κοιλία (“womb”), a first declension noun in the
  genitive case, showing source or origin. The genitive pronoun σου (“your”)
  adds possession, making it clear that the womb belongs to Mary.
</p>

<h2>Dative Case</h2>
<p>
  The dative case is used to mark the indirect object, the recipient or
  beneficiary of an action. Beyond this core function, it also expresses:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Instrumental means: ἐν λόγῳ — “with a word”</li>
  <li>Location or sphere: ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ — “in the church”</li>
  <li>Association or accompaniment: σὺν χαρᾷ — “with joy”</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The dative frequently occurs with prepositions such as ἐν ("in"), σύν
  ("with"), and sometimes πρός ("at, near") when used in static or relational
  contexts.
</p>
<p>
  Example: ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ οὐ φόβος ἐστίν — “There is no fear in love” (1 John
  4:18). Here, τῇ ἀγάπῃ is in the dative case, functioning as the object of the
  preposition ἐν and indicating the sphere in which the statement holds true.
</p>

<h2>Accusative Case</h2>
<p>
  The accusative case typically denotes the direct object of a transitive
  verb—the entity directly affected by the action. It is also used to express:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extent of time or space: ὁδὸν πολλήν — “a long road”</li>
  <li>Goal or direction: εἰς τὴν πόλιν — “into the city”</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Accusative nouns often occur with a variety of prepositions that govern
  motion, direction, or goal, such as διά, εἰς, ἐπί, and κατά.
</p>
<p>
  Example: ζητεῖτε πρῶτον τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ — “Seek first the kingdom of
  God” (Matt. 6:33). In this verse, τὴν βασιλείαν ("the kingdom") is the
  accusative direct object of the verb ζητεῖτε ("seek"). The adjective πρῶτον
  indicates this is "first" priority. The phrase τοῦ θεοῦ ("of God") is a second
  declension noun which we will learn in the next chapter. The article τοῦ
  appears in the genitive singular masculine which agrees with θεοῦ, a genitive
  of possession, which expresses ownership or relationship specifying whose
  kingdom is to be sought.
</p>

<h2>Vocative Case</h2>
<p>
  The vocative is used for direct address, marking the person or entity being
  spoken to. It often appears without the definite article and is syntactically
  independent, meaning it does not play a grammatical role in the sentence's
  core structure. While its morphological form often mirrors the nominative
  singular, some nouns exhibit distinct vocative endings, especially in the
  masculine declensions.
</p>
<p>
  Due to its limited use and primarily rhetorical function, the vocative is
  given minimal syntactic treatment here. Nonetheless, it occasionally appears
  in imperative or hortatory contexts.
</p>
<p>
  Examples: Μάρθα, Μάρθα... — “Martha, Martha...” (Luke 10:41) or σὺ δέ, ὦ
  ἄνθρωπε, τίς εἶ; — "But who are you, O man?" (Romans 9:20).
</p>

<h1>Article</h1>
<h2>Morphosyntactic Agreement</h2>
<p>
  The Greek definite article—ὁ (masculine), ἡ (feminine), and τό (neuter)—is a
  fully inflected element that agrees with its noun in gender, number, and case.
  In first declension feminine nouns, the relevant form is ἡ, which declines in
  regular patterns parallel to the noun it accompanies.
</p>
<p>
  The article always agrees with the noun it modifies in case, number, and
  gender, forming a cohesive noun phrase. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ἡ ἀγάπη — “the love” (nominative singular, feminine)</li>
  <li>τῆς καρδίας — “of the heart” (genitive singular, feminine)</li>
  <li>ταῖς γλώσσαις — “to the tongues” (dative plural, feminine)</li>
  <li>τὰς βασιλείας — “the kingdoms” (accusative plural, feminine)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This agreement is not merely a matter of grammatical correctness but also
  assists in disambiguating syntactic function. In sentences with flexible word
  order, the form of the article signals the grammatical role of the noun,
  especially when modifiers, participles, or adjectives are present.
</p>
<h2>Article Usage</h2>
<p>
  The article marks out specificity and sometimes uniqueness. For example, when
  Jesus says, ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἀλήθεια, the article ἡ marks the noun not merely as
  “truth” in general but as the truth—a singular, definitive concept tied to
  Christ’s identity.
</p>
<p>
  The absence of the article does not always imply indefiniteness (like "a dog"
  as opposed to "the dog"), nor does it always reduce specificity. In many
  cases, especially in poetic or proverbial contexts, abstract nouns or plural
  forms appear anarthrous (without an article) while still conveying definite
  meaning. However, when the article is absent, interpretation becomes more
  dependent on context, word order, and semantic cues.
</p>
<p>
  For example: εἰρήνης οὐκ ἔστιν — “There is no peace” (cf. Isa. 59:8 LXX; Rom.
  3:17). The noun εἰρήνης appears without the article, yet the meaning remains
  conceptually definite. Such cases call for exegetical sensitivity.

<p>
  Two nouns serve as model paradigms. For the η-type, ἡ φωνή ("voice"), and for
  the α-type, ἡ καρδία ("heart"). These nouns are frequently found in the New
  Testament, and provide clear, representative examples of their respective
  subtypes.
</p>
<p>Each noun is shown below to illustrate the cases for singular and plural:</p>
