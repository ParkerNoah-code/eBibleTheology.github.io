      <h1>First Declension</h1>
      <p>
        This chapter focuses on first declension nouns in Koine Greek, a group
        of nouns that share similar patterns of inflection. Most first
        declension nouns are feminine, though a few masculine exceptions exist.
        These exceptions, such as νεανίας ("young man") and προφήτης
        ("prophet"), are not the main focus here and will be discussed
        elsewhere.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Purpose and Structure</h3>
      <p>The approach in this chapter is threefold:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Morphological:</strong> What the noun looks like (form and
          endings)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Syntactic:</strong> What the noun does in a sentence (subject,
          object, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functional:</strong> How the noun works in context (especially
          in the New Testament)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Basic Grammatical Concepts</h3>
      <p>
        To study first declension nouns, we need to understand some basic
        features of Greek nouns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Number:</strong> singular (one) or plural (more than one)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> this chapter focuses on feminine nouns</li>
        <li><strong>Case:</strong> shows the noun's role in the sentence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Greek has five cases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Nominative:</strong> subject or subject complement</li>
        <li><strong>Genitive:</strong> shows possession or origin</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dative:</strong> indicates the indirect object, means, or
          location
        </li>
        <li><strong>Accusative:</strong> direct object or extent</li>
        <li><strong>Vocative:</strong> used for direct address</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        I'm mentioning the vocative case here but it will not be discussed in
        detail because it appears less often and plays a limited role.
      </p>

      <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
      <p>By the end of this chapter, students should be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify first declension feminine nouns by their endings</li>
        <li>Parse their forms (break down stem, case, number, and gender)</li>
        <li>Understand their function in biblical texts</li>
        <li>Translate them with greater accuracy and insight</li>
        <li>Apply this knowledge in interpreting New Testament passages</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Morphology</h2>
      <h3>η-Type and α-Type</h3>
      <p>
        First declension nouns in Koine Greek form a coherent morphological
        group characterized by shared inflectional patterns. The key feature
        that defines this declension is the modification of word endings, known
        as case endings, to indicate grammatical case and number. While all
        first declension nouns follow the same general system, two major
        subtypes emerge based on the final vowel of the stem: the η-type and the
        α-type. These subtypes are not separate declensions but represent
        variations within the first declension pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        The η-type is marked by the presence of the vowel η in the nominative
        singular form. Nouns of this type typically maintain the η throughout
        the singular paradigm. Examples include words like ζωή ("life"), φωνή
        ("voice"), and γραφή ("scripture").
      </p>
      <p>
        The α-type, on the other hand, features the vowel α in the nominative
        singular. This group includes nouns such as καρδία ("heart"), βασιλεία
        ("kingdom"), and ἀλήθεια ("truth"). Within the α-type category, some
        nouns consistently retain the α vowel in the singular forms, while
        others show variation in certain cases, particularly the genitive and
        dative singular. Nevertheless, the overall structure of their endings
        remains distinct from the η-type and can be learned as a stable
        paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both η-type and α-type nouns share the same endings in the plural.
        Regardless of the stem vowel in the singular, first declension nouns
        follow a unified plural pattern.
      </p>
      <p>The case endings for the two types can be summarized as follows:</p>
      <table>

          <tr>
            <th>Case</th>

        Two nouns serve as model paradigms. For the η-type, ἡ ζωή ("life"), and
        for the α-type, ἡ καρδία ("heart"). These nouns are frequently found in
        the New Testament, and provide clear, representative examples of their
        respective subtypes. Each noun is shown below to illustrate the cases
        for singular and plural:

        This morphological system is highly regular and provides a reliable
        framework for both recognition and production of noun forms. Memorize
        and internalize these paradigms. You should practice until you can write
        them out multiple times from memory.
      </p>

      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <p>
        The function of a noun within a sentence is primarily indicated by its
        case. Each case conveys a different syntactic role, allowing Greek to
        express relationships between words largely through morphology rather
        than word order. First declension nouns, like all Greek nouns, appear in
        five cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative.
        Although the morphological endings differ slightly between η-type and
        α-type nouns, the syntactic functions of the cases remain the same
        across both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these syntactic roles, the Greek case system enables precise and
        flexible expression. First declension nouns, by means of their case
        endings, take on a variety of grammatical functions that must be
        interpreted in light of context, article usage, and accompanying verbs
        or prepositions. This section outlines the core syntactic uses of each
        case.
      </p>

      <h3>Nominative Case</h3>
      <p>
        The nominative is the case of the subject. It marks the noun that
        performs the action of a finite verb or exists in a particular state or
        condition. It is also used for the subject complement in equative
        (linking) constructions, particularly with the verb εἰμί ("to be").
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ζωή — “I am the life” (John 11:25). Here, ἡ ζωή is a
        nominative noun functioning as the subject complement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nouns in the nominative may also appear in appositional constructions,
        where two nominative elements refer to the same entity, often for
        clarification or emphasis (e.g. "My neighbor, Bob, is out of town").
      </p>

      <h3>Genitive Case</h3>
      <p>
        The genitive broadly expresses the idea of relationship. Its primary
        syntactic function is to qualify or limit another noun, frequently
        indicating possession (e.g., "of someone/something"). However, its range
        is extensive, encompassing several types of relations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Possession: τῆς καρδίας — “of the heart”</li>
        <li>Source or origin: ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ — “the word of God”</li>
        <li>Description or quality: συνείδησις ἀγαθῆς — “a good conscience”</li>
        <li>Separation or removal: ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς — “from the earth”</li>
        <li>
          Agency (in passive constructions): ἐπαινεῖται ὑπὸ τῶν μαθητῶν — “is
          praised by the disciples”
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It often appears with prepositions such as ἐκ ("out of"), ἀπό ("from"),
        and διά ("through" when indicating agency or cause).
      </p>

      <h3>Dative Case</h3>
      <p>
        The dative case is used to mark the indirect object, the recipient or
        beneficiary of an action. Beyond this core function, it also expresses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instrumental means: ἐν λόγῳ — “with a word”</li>
        <li>Location or sphere: ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ — “in the church”</li>
        <li>Association or accompaniment: σὺν χαρᾷ — “with joy”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The dative frequently occurs with prepositions such as ἐν ("in"), σύν
        ("with"), and sometimes πρός ("at, near") when used in static or
        relational contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ οὐ φόβος ἐστίν — “There is no fear in love” (1 John
        4:18). Here, τῇ ἀγάπῃ is in the dative case, functioning as the object
        of the preposition ἐν and indicating the sphere in which the statement
        holds true.
      </p>

      <h3>Accusative Case</h3>
      <p>
        The accusative case typically denotes the direct object of a transitive
        verb—the entity directly affected by the action. It is also used to
        express:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extent of time or space: ὁδὸν πολλήν — “a long road”</li>
        <li>Goal or direction: εἰς τὴν πόλιν — “into the city”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Accusative nouns often occur with a variety of prepositions that govern
        motion, direction, or goal, such as διά, εἰς, ἐπί, and κατά.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: ζητεῖτε πρῶτον τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ — “Seek first the kingdom
        of God” (Matt. 6:33). In this verse, τὴν βασιλείαν is the accusative
        direct object of the verb ζητεῖτε.
      </p>

      <h3>Vocative Case</h3>
      <p>
        The vocative is used for direct address, marking the person or entity
        being spoken to. It often appears without the definite article and is
        syntactically independent, meaning it does not play a grammatical role
        in the sentence's core structure. While its morphological form often
        mirrors the nominative singular, some nouns exhibit distinct vocative
        endings, especially in the masculine declensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to its limited use and primarily rhetorical function, the vocative
        is given minimal syntactic treatment here. Nonetheless, it occasionally
        appears in imperative or hortatory contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples: Μάρθα, Μάρθα... — “Martha, Martha...” (Luke 10:41) or σὺ δέ, ὦ
        ἄνθρωπε, τίς εἶ; — "But who are you, O man?" (Romans 9:20).
      </p>

      <h2>Article</h2>
      <p>
        The Greek definite article—ὁ (masculine), ἡ (feminine), and τό
        (neuter)—is a fully inflected element that agrees with its noun in
        gender, number, and case. In first declension feminine nouns, the
        relevant form is ἡ, which declines in regular patterns parallel to the
        noun it accompanies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike English, where the article "the" is not inflected, the Greek
        article serves both grammatical and interpretive functions. Its primary
        role is to mark definiteness, identifying the noun as either
        contextually known or uniquely referential. In Koine Greek, especially
        in the New Testament, the article appears with high frequency and
        performs several critical functions beyond simple definiteness.
      </p>

      <h3>Morphosyntactic Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        The article always agrees with the noun it modifies in case, number, and
        gender, forming a cohesive noun phrase. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ἡ ἀγάπη — “the love” (nominative singular, feminine)</li>
        <li>τῆς καρδίας — “of the heart” (genitive singular, feminine)</li>
        <li>ταῖς γλώσσαις — “to the tongues” (dative plural, feminine)</li>
        <li>τὰς βασιλείας — “the kingdoms” (accusative plural, feminine)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This agreement is not merely a matter of grammatical correctness but
        also assists in disambiguating syntactic function. In sentences with
        flexible word order, the form of the article signals the grammatical
        role of the noun, especially when modifiers, participles, or adjectives
        are present.
      </p>
      <h3>Article Usage</h3>
      <p>
        The article marks out specificity and sometimes uniqueness. For example,
        when Jesus says, ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἀλήθεια, the article ἡ marks the noun not
        merely as “truth” in general but as the truth—a singular, definitive
        concept tied to Christ’s identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The article also frequently accompanies first declension nouns
        functioning as subjects or objects in narrative and discourse. Its
        presence helps establish thematic continuity or mark the topical focus
        of a passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ ζητεῖτε — “Seek the kingdom of God”
        (Matt. 6:33). Here, the article τὴν signals the accusative direct object
        and denotes a specific, identifiable “kingdom” already introduced or
        presumed in the discourse context.
      </p>

      <h3>Absence of the Article</h3>
      <p>
        The absence of the article does not always imply indefiniteness, nor
        does it always reduce specificity. In many cases, especially in poetic
        or proverbial contexts, abstract nouns or plural forms appear anarthrous
        (without an article) while still conveying definite meaning. However,
        when the article is absent, interpretation becomes more dependent on
        context, word order, and semantic cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: εἰρήνης οὐκ ἔστιν — “There is no peace” (cf. Isa. 59:8 LXX;
        Rom. 3:17). The noun εἰρήνης appears without the article, yet the
        meaning remains conceptually definite. Such cases call for exegetical
        sensitivity.
      </p>

      <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
      <p>
        Mastery of vocabulary is essential for accurate reading, parsing, and
        interpretation of Koine Greek texts. In this section, we focus on
        acquiring a core set of high-frequency first declension feminine nouns.

        Grammatical analysis is most effective when applied to actual texts.
        This section offers exegetical annotations of selected New Testament
        passages that include first declension feminine nouns. Each example
        demonstrates how form and function contribute to the theological and
        interpretive meaning of a verse. The goal is to integrate morphological
        recognition, syntactic role identification, and semantic understanding,
        providing a model for grammatical exegesis.

      <h3>ἡ ζωή — John 11:25</h3>

      <p><strong>Greek Text:</strong> ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ζωή</p>

      <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "I am the life."</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Form:</strong> ἡ ζωή – Nominative Singular, η-type first
          declension
        </li>
        <li><strong>Article:</strong> ἡ – Nominative Singular Feminine</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Syntactic Role:</strong> Subject Complement (Predicate
          Nominative) of the verb εἰμι ("I am")
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This clause is a classic example of an
        <strong>equative (or copulative) sentence</strong>, in which the linking
        verb εἰμι ("to be") joins the subject ἐγώ ("I") with the subject
        complement ἡ ζωή ("the life"). The noun ζωή belongs to the first
        declension, specifically the η-type, which typically includes feminine
        nouns ending in -η in the nominative singular.
      </p>
      <p>
        The article ἡ marks the noun as
        <strong>definite</strong>, underscoring that "the life" is not an
        indefinite or general concept but a specific and absolute one. By
        declaring ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ζωή, Jesus identifies Himself not merely as one who
        gives life, but as <strong>life itself</strong>.

      <h3>ἡ γραφή — John 7:38</h3>
      <p><strong>Greek Text:</strong> ἡ γραφὴ εἶπεν</p>
      <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "The Scripture said..."</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Form:</strong> ἡ γραφή – Nominative Singular, η-type first
          declension
        </li>
        <li><strong>Article:</strong> ἡ – Nominative Singular Feminine</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Syntactic Role:</strong> Subject of the verb εἶπεν ("said")
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The noun γραφή is a first declension feminine noun, ending in -η in the
        nominative singular. In this sentence, it appears with the definite
        article ἡ and functions as the grammatical subject of the aorist active
        indicative verb εἶπεν.
      </p>

      <p>
        The presence of the definite article ἡ signals that this is not merely
        any writing but a particular and recognized entity: the authoritative
        body of sacred Scripture. The article conveys definiteness and
        specificity, identifying γραφή as a known and singular source of divine
        speech or instruction.
      </p>

      <h3>τὴν δόξαν — John 1:14</h3>
      <p><strong>Greek Text:</strong> ἐθεασάμεθα τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ</p>

      <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "We beheld His glory."</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Form:</strong> τὴν δόξαν – Accusative Singular, α-type first
          declension
        </li>
        <li><strong>Article:</strong> τὴν – Accusative Singular Feminine</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Syntactic Role:</strong> Direct object of the verb ἐθεασάμεθα
          ("we beheld")
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The noun δόξα belongs to the α-type of first declension nouns. In this
        passage, it appears in the accusative singular form δόξαν, with the
        definite article τὴν, indicating that it functions as the direct object
        of the verb ἐθεασάμεθα, the first person plural aorist middle indicative
        of θεωρέω, meaning "to behold" or "to observe attentively."
      </p>

      <p>
        The use of the definite article τὴν gives specificity and prominence to
        the noun. This is not a generic or undefined "glory," but a particular,
        revealed glory which the witnesses (the subject "we") directly observed.
        Grammatically, this construction clearly illustrates the accusative
        case’s core function: to mark the recipient or target of the action of
        the verb.

      <h3>τῆς καρδίας — Mark 12:30</h3>
      <p><strong>Greek Text:</strong> ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου</p>

      <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "With all your heart."</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Form:</strong> τῆς καρδίας – Genitive Singular, α-type first
          declension
        </li>
        <li><strong>Article:</strong> τῆς – Genitive Singular Feminine</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Syntactic Role:</strong> Object of the preposition ἐκ (in the
          contracted form ἐξ before a vowel)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The noun καρδία is a feminine noun of the α-type first declension. In
        this verse, it appears in the genitive singular form καρδίας,
        accompanied by the definite article τῆς. The phrase ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας
        functions as a prepositional phrase governed by ἐκ (appearing here as ἐξ
        due to the following vowel sound in ὅλης).
      </p>

      <p>
        The preposition ἐκ ("out of," "from") governs the genitive case and
        denotes the idea of source, origin, or inner basis. Here, it expresses
        the internal origin of love and devotion: it flows from one's heart. The
        adjective ὅλης ("all, whole") modifies καρδίας, emphasizing the
        completeness of the source, while the definite article τῆς adds
        structural precision and helps clarify the grammatical relationships
        within the phrase.
      </p>

      <p>
        This verse is quoting the Shema from Deuteronomy 6:5. The heart (καρδία)
        in biblical anthropology is not merely the seat of emotion but
        encompasses the will, intellect, and inner person.
      </p>

      <h3>τὴν βασιλείαν — Matthew 6:33</h3>
      <p><strong>Greek Text:</strong> ζητεῖτε πρῶτον τὴν βασιλείαν</p>

      <p><strong>Translation:</strong> "Seek first the kingdom."</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Form:</strong> τὴν βασιλείαν – Accusative Singular, α-type
          first declension
        </li>
        <li><strong>Article:</strong> τὴν – Accusative Singular Feminine</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Syntactic Role:</strong> Direct object of the imperative verb
          ζητεῖτε ("seek")
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The noun βασιλεία is a feminine first declension noun of the α-type,
        taking the accusative singular form βασιλείαν when used as the direct
        object. In this verse, it appears with the definite article τὴν, which
        marks it as a specific, recognizable entity. The verb ζητεῖτε is a
        second person plural present active imperative of ζητέω, meaning "seek"
        or "strive after."
      </p>

      <p>
        Syntactically, the structure of the sentence is straightforward: an
        imperative verb followed by its direct object. The presence of the
        adverb πρῶτον ("first") adds a layer of emphasis, indicating both
        temporal and priority-based significance in the action of seeking. The
        definite article τὴν signals that this is not a generic or earthly
        kingdom, but the singular divine kingdom — the reign and rule of God.
