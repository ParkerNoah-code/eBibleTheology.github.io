        John Chrysostom comments, "Observe how he represses the high thoughts of
        the Jews; each argument lays the ground for the next, and his language
        is authoritative.
        <em>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles</em>. The
        phrase, <em>Jews by nature</em>, implies that we, who are not
        proselytes, but educated from early youth in the Law, have relinquished
        our habitual mode of life, and betaken ourselves to the faith which is
        in Christ." (<a

        Jerome comments, "We know that we cannot be saved by the works of the
        Law but by faith in Christ. We have believed in Christ so that our faith
        in him might give us what the Law could not. We abandoned the Law in
        which we could not be saved, and we have gone over to faith, in which
        the devotion of a pure heart is demanded, not the circumcision of the
        flesh. By now withdrawing from the Gentiles we declare that whoever is
        uncircumcised is unclean. Therefore, is faith in Christ, by which we
        previously thought we were saved, the agent of sin rather than of
        righteousness, which abolishes [the need for] circumcision, the very
        thing without which one is deemed unclean? God forbid that I should
        uphold what I once attacked and knew would never again be beneficial to
        me. When I decisively departed from the Law, I died to it that I might
        live in Christ and be nailed to his cross and that I might be reborn as
        a new man and live by faith, not by the flesh, and leave the world in
        Christ. I remain steadfast in my original resolve. Christ did not die
        for me for nothing. If I was able to be saved by keeping the old Law
        instead of by having faith in him, then I have believed in Christ in
        vain." (<a

        John Calvin comments, "Skilfully anticipating the objection, Paul turns
        it to the opposite conclusion. Since the Jews themselves, with all their
        advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of Christ, how
        much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for salvation
        through faith?" (<a

        Clement of Rome writes, "Nor were the rest of his tribes in any little
        glory: God having promised that their seed shall be as the stars of
        heaven. They were all therefore greatly glorified, not for their own
        sake, or for their own works, or for the righteousness that they
        themselves wrought, but through his will. And we also being called by
        the same will in Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, neither
        by our own wisdom, or knowledge, or piety, or the works which we have
        done in the holiness of our hearts. But by that faith, by which God
        Almighty has justified all men from the beginning; to whom be glory for
        ever and ever, Amen." (<a

        Jerome comments, "Some say that if Paul is right to assert that no one
        is justified by the works of the Law but by faith in Jesus Christ, then
        the patriarchs, prophets, and saints who lived prior to Christ's advent
        were lacking in something. We must remind these objectors that Paul is
        talking here about those who have not pursued righteousness and who
        believe that they can be justified only by works. The saints who lived
        long ago, however, were justified by faith in Christ. Abraham foresaw
        the day of Christ and rejoiced. 'Moses regarded disgrace for the sake of
        Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was
        looking ahead to his reward.' Isaiah beheld the glory of Christ, as John
        the Evangelist notes... Thus it is not so much the works of the Law that
        are condemned as those who are confident that they can be justified by
        them...
      </p>

      <p>
        The flesh about which it is said, 'All flesh is like grass, and all of
        its glory is like the flowers of the field,' is not justified by the
        works of the Law. But the flesh spoken of in the mystery of the
        resurrection, 'All flesh will see God's salvation,' is justified through
        faith in Jesus Christ. According to the more common understanding, it
        used to be that the only flesh redeemable by the Law were those who
        lived in Palestine. Now, however, all flesh is justified by faith in
        Jesus Christ, as his churches are being established all over the world."

        Peter Lombard comments, "In short, there is no way that one can be
        justified except through the faith of Christ Jesus, referring to the
        faith by which one believes in Christ. It is for this reason, therefore,
        that we Jews, like the gentiles, believe in Christ Jesus, so that we
        might be justified by the faith of Christ. The Apostle does not say that
        by faith good works are thereby made meaningless, for God renders to
        each person according to that person's works. Rather, it is because
        works proceed from grace—not grace from works." (The Bible in Medieval
        Tradition: The Letter to the Galatians, Ian Christopher Levy, Eerdmans,
        2011).

        Martin Luther comments, "After we have taught faith in Christ, we teach
        good works. 'Since you have found Christ by faith,' we say, 'begin now
        to work and do well. Love God and your neighbor. Call upon God, give
        thanks unto Him, praise Him, confess Him. These are good works. Let them
        flow from a cheerful heart, because you have remission of sin in
        Christ.' " (<a

        John of Damascus comments, "Look at the absurd direction into which he
        leads those who are attached to the Law. If the faith in Christ, he
        says, is not sufficient to justify, but, once again there is a need to
        uphold the Law, and if those, having left the Law for Christ, are not
        justified in doing so, but rather are condemned, then Christ will be
        found to be the cause of our condemnation, since we left the law on his
        account in order to run towards the faith. 'God forbid,' he says. Seeing
        the absurdity, which this doctrine leads to, he immediately turns away
        from it by using this aphorism." (<a

        Anselm writes, "My merits were Thy Death; my iniquity Thy Chastisement.
        O wonderful compact of judgment; O arrangment of unspeakable mystery!
        The unjust sinneth, and the Just is punished; the guilty erreth, and the
        Innocent is beaten; the unloving offendeth, and the Loving is condemned;
        what the evil deserveth, the Good suffereth; what the slave
        perpetrateth, the Master payeth the penalty for; what man committeth,
        God endureth... For I have done wickedly, Thou sufferest the penalty: I
        have committed sin, Thou art visited with the vengeance: I have been
        guilty of crimes, and Thou art subjected to torment: I have been proud,
        Thou art humbled: I have been puffed up, Thou art emaciated: I have
        shewn myself disobedient, Thou, by being obedient to the Father, payest
        the penalty of my disobedience." (<a

        Ignatius writes, "Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness.
        For were He to reward us according to our works, we should cease to be.
        Therefore, having become His disciples, let us learn to live according
        to the principles of Christianity. For whosoever is called by any other
        name besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the
        old, the sour leaven, and be changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus
        Christ. Be salted in Him, lest any one among you should be corrupted,
        since by your savour you shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess
        Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not embrace Judaism,
        but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue which believes might be
        gathered together to God." (<a

        were sufficient to purge; but, as might have been expected, this was
        that saving bath of the olden time which followed those who repented,
        and who no longer were purified by the blood of goats and of sheep, or
        by the ashes of an heifer, or by the offerings of fine flour, but by
        faith through the blood of Christ, and through His death, who died for

        Mathetes writes, "But when our wickedness had reached its height, and it
        had been clearly shown that its reward, punishment and death, was
        impending over us; and when the time had come which God had before
        appointed for manifesting His own kindness and power, how the one love
        of God, through exceeding regard for men, did not regard us with hatred,
        nor thrust us away, nor remember our iniquity against us, but showed
        great long-suffering, and bore with us, He Himself took on Him the
        burden of our iniquities, He gave His own Son as a ransom for us, the
        holy One for transgressors, the blameless One for the wicked, the
        righteous One for the unrighteous, the incorruptible One for the
        corruptible, the immortal One for those who are mortal. For what other
        thing was capable of covering our sins than His righteousness? By what
        other one was it possible that we, the wicked and ungodly, could be
        justified, than by the only Son of God? O sweet exchange!" (<a

        William Nicoll comments, "Why did St. Paul love Christ with such an
        overwhelming passion? To answer it aright would be to retrace the whole
        history. But first we say that St. Paul's love was the love of
        gratitude. 'He loved me and gave Himself for me' that is the burning
        centre. Christ died for the ungodly. We are justified by faith in His
        blood. St. Paul knew the great desolation of the Victim of Love. Christ
        was made a curse for him on the tree of Calvary. Christ kept knocking by
        the voice of interior grace at the door of his heart till his heart
        opened. Then the soul that had been separated from the Author of Peace
        was restless and weary no longer. To him the meritorious death of Christ
        became the beautiful gate of the temple whereby he entered into the
        treasure-house of God. The full, finished, and perfect sacrifice and
        atonement for the sins of the whole world blotted out the transgressions
        that were past. More than that: if any man be in Christ there is a new
        creation. There is the stroke that ends him and the touch that begins
        him afresh. The faith of St. Paul apprehended the dying of the Lord
        Jesus, and the Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead quickened his
        mortal body. Mystically he died and rose again in Christ." (<a

        Marius Victorinus comments, "<em>I am not ungrateful to God’s grace</em>
        (2: 21), so that, God having redeemed me through Christ and Christ
        having handed himself over for my sake, I would return to the hope of
        the Law—all the hope I have in Christ being disregarded—and would
        believe myself to be justified based on the works of the Law. That would
        be ungrateful to the one who did so much for me, who for my sake would
        put himself in the line of fire in order to liberate me from my sins by
        taking their penalties upon himself." (<a

        Bernard writes, "As for your justice, so great is the fragrance it
        diffuses that you are called not only just but even justice itself, the
        justice that makes men just. Your power to make men just is measured by
        your generosity in forgiving. Therefore the man who through sorrow for
        sin hungers and thirsts for justice, let him trust in the One who
        changes the sinner into a just man, and, judged righteous in terms of
        faith alone, he will have peace with God." (<a

        Charles Spurgeon comments, "They who say that the death of Christ goes
        only part of the way, but that man must do something in order to merit
        eternal life,— these, I say, make this death of Christ to be only
        partially effective, and, in yet clearer terms, ineffectual in and of
        itself. If it be even hinted that the blood of Jesus is not price enough
        till man adds his silver or his gold, then his blood is not our
        redemption at all, and Christ is no Redeemer! If it be taught that our
        Lord’s bearing of sin for us did not make a perfect atonement, and that
        it is ineffectual till we either do or suffer something to complete it,
        then in the supplemental work lies the real virtue, and Christ’s work is
        in itself insufficient. His death cry of 'It is finished,' must have
        been all a mistake, if still it is not finished; and if a believer in
        Christ is not completely saved by what Christ has done, but must do
        something himself to complete it, then salvation was not finished, and
        the Saviour’s work remains imperfect till we, poor sinners, lend a hand
        to make up for his deficiencies. What blasphemy lies in such a
        supposition!" (<a
