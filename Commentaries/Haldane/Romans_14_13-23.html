      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — Let us not therefore judge one another any more; but judge
        this rather; that no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall,
        in his brother’s way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us not therefore judge one another any more. — This dissuasive
        appears to be now addressed to both the parties. The Apostle having
        declared what was peculiarly adapted to each, now declares what is
        equally applicable to both. Judging or condemning was in a peculiar
        sense the fault of the one; but both of them in a more extended sense of
        the word might be said to judge or condemn one another. The strong
        brother who despised the weak virtually judged him or condemned him.
        Paul now takes them both together, and addresses them with the same
        caution. He extends the exhortation to himself, and to the whole body of
        Christians. They are not to usurp authority over one another, nor to
        usurp the right to judge for one another in any matter. But judge this
        rather, that no man put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall, in
        his brother’s way. — The word judge is here used in an allusive sense,
        and not in its proper or literal sense. Instead of judging, we ought to
        do another thing, which is not properly judging, but called judging, in
        allusion to the word immediately going before. This is similar to the
        expression, ‘This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He
        hath sent.’ The Scriptures abound with instances of this figurative way
        of speaking. Instead of judging one another, Christians are to avoid
        doing anything that will have a tendency to stumble one another, or
        cause any to fall into sin. This is peculiarly applicable to the strong,
        who, by an improper use of their liberty, might ensnare their weak
        brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
        nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth anything to be
        unclean, to him it is unclean.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, and am persuaded — This clearly refutes the opinion of those who
        argue that at the time of writing this Epistle the law was not
        abolished, and that it was not in this state that the different parties
        were to forbear with respect to one another, but that the Jew was still
        to keep the law till its abolition should be explicitly announced. But
        that it was abolished, is perfectly clear from this chapter. The Apostle
        knew himself, and here he teaches others, that the Mosaic dispensation
        was abolished, yet enjoins the strong and the weak to forbear mutually
        with each other. By the Lord Jesus. — That is, Paul knew this by the
        teaching of the Lord Jesus. Calvin is unquestionably mistaken in
        applying this, not to the teaching of the Lord Jesus, but to the
        cleansing of meats by the Lord Jesus. He says, ‘The Apostle adds, in the
        Lord Jesus, because His kindness and grace is the cause why all
        creatures are blessed to us by the Lord, which were otherwise cursed in
        Adam.’ This is no doubt a fact, but it is not the thing here taught.
        Paul is here asserting that his knowledge of the abolition of the
        distinction of meats was not obtained by his own searching into the
        nature of things, but was a revelation from the Lord Jesus. This
        doctrine was not a private opinion of his own, but the revealed will of
        his Master. Nothing unclean of itself. — This undoubtedly shows that
        there is nothing unclean in blood more than in anything else. The
        Apostle here asserts of everything that could be used for food, that
        there is nothing unclean in itself. When blood and other meats were
        prohibited by the law, it was not because there was anything in
        themselves that rendered them unclean. It was the will of God, because
        they were of a typical nature, and therefore all their uncleanness ended
        when Christ came. Why, then, it may be asked, was blood prohibited in
        Acts 15? Evidently as a law of forbearance, because of the prejudices of
        the Jews. This is expressed in the very passage. ‘For Moses of old time
        hath in every city them that preach Him, being read in the synagogues
        every Sabbath-day.’ It would still be a duty to avoid these things, if
        we were in such situations that it would give offense to the Jews. That
        such is the true view of the matter, is evident from this, that though
        the Jews were prohibited from eating things strangled, they were not
        prohibited to give them or sell them to strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had the thing been unlawful in itself, they would not have been
        permitted to give to strangers that which it was unlawful for themselves
        to eat. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight justly remarks, ‘It is observable that in this discourse,
        which is intended to show that under the Gospel all sorts of food may be
        used without sin, there is no exception of blood and things strangled.’
        But he is wrong in his inference from this fact. ‘May we not from this
        infer,’ he says, ‘that the prohibition of these things to the Gentile
        converts, mentioned Acts 15:29, is to be understood of such Gentiles
        only as had been proselytes?’ This is forced and unnatural. But to him
        that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it as unclean. — This is
        self-evident truth, which has no exception. For if a person does what he
        thinks God forbids, he is guilty with respect to God as really as if the
        thing had been actually prohibited by God. Persons in ignorance ought to
        be instructed, but they ought never to be encouraged to do what they
        themselves judge to be contrary to the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
        not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not
        charitably. — The weak brother would be grieved in his mind when he
        should see the strong eating meat which he considered unclean. Now it is
        not love that will prompt us to do anything to afflict another. If,
        then, the strong loves the weak brother, would he, for the sake of his
        appetite, eat anything that would grieve him? Self-denial in such
        matters is the result of love, and when any one will not abstain from
        gratifying his appetite to avoid hurting his brother, it shows that he
        is deficient in love. Destroy not him with thy meat. — This supposes
        that the weak brother may, by the example of the strong, be induced to
        do what he is not persuaded is lawful; and thus, though the thing be in
        itself lawful, it is sin in him, and consequently its tendency is to
        bring him into condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not, indeed, possible that this can ultimately be the case with
        any one for whom Christ died; but this is a warning to avoid doing
        anything that in itself tends to destroy him. For whom Christ died. — If
        Christ died for the weak brother, how unlike Christ is this strong
        believer, who will do what he knows will destroy his brother, if he
        follow his example without having his knowledge! The love of Christ in
        giving His life for this brother, and the indifference with respect to
        him which is manifested by the person who should thus abuse his liberty,
        are here set in strong contraSt. Ver. 16. — Let not then your good be
        evil spoken of:
      </p>
      <p>
        Let not then your good. — Their good appears to be their liberty of
        disregarding the distinction of meats, and the law in general. This was
        a good thing to them, because the law was in itself a yoke and a
        grievous burden. They were doing what was good and right in itself in
        using this liberty, but they should be careful to use it in such a way
        as not to be the occasion of being represented as if in what they did
        they were regardless of the authority of God. This is a decisive
        distinction between the dispensation of Christ and that of Moses. It was
        an advantage to be delivered from the peculiar restraints of the
        ceremonial law, but it would be no advantage to be delivered from any
        part of the dispensation of Christ. This shows the sovereignty of God,
        in subjecting His people in one dispensation to burdens which He removes
        in another. Be evil spoken of. — Their good would be evil spoken of,
        when their neglect of the distinctions of the law should be ascribed to
        the indulgence of appetite, and when their conduct should embolden the
        weak to do what was contrary to their conscience. Then. — That is, since
        some of the brethren were so weak as to judge those who did eat certain
        meats to be influenced by improper motives, then, in order to avoid
        this, they ought to decline the use of their liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
        righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink. — This imports that the
        service which belongs to the kingdom of God, and which He requires from
        all His subjects, does not consist in abstaining from, or in using, any
        kind of meats. The typical dispensation of the Old Testament enjoined a
        distinction of meats. Men are peculiarly prone to cling to externals in
        religious worship. It is, then, of great importance to attend to this
        decision of the Holy Ghost by the Apostle Paul. The distinction of meats
        has nothing to do in the service of God under the New Testament. This
        settles the question as to blood. If the eating of blood is still
        prohibited, it cannot be said that the kingdom of God is not meat and
        drink. But righteousness. — This is not the righteousness of God which
        is imputed to the believer, as is evident from the following verse, but
        the righteousness of which he is the subject. Righteousness sometimes
        refers especially to the duties which we owe to men, but in its most
        comprehensive sense it includes equally our duty to God; and there is no
        reason why it should not here have its most comprehensive meaning.
        Peace. — This is a criterion of a true servant in the kingdom of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having peace with God, he endeavors to have peace with the brethren and
        with all men. Nothing is more unlike the spirit of genuine Christianity
        than a contentious disposition. Joy in the Holy Ghost. — The joy of a
        Christian communicated by the Holy Ghost cannot be comprehended by any
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        He rejoices even in the midst of trouble, and is often most happy when
        the world thinks him most miserable. Joy is the immediate effect of
        receiving the Gospel, which is glad tidings of great joy, as announced
        to the shepherds on the birth of our Savior. It springs from a sense of
        reconciliation with God. We see it exemplified in the three thousand
        converted on the day of Pentecost, in the eunuch, and in the jailer at
        Philippi, as soon as they received the truth. Joy is enjoined again and
        again as the duty of believers. ‘Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I
        say rejoice.’ ‘Rejoice evermore.’ ‘These things write we unto you, that
        your joy may be full.’ Our Lord dwells much upon it in His last
        discourse with His disciples, which contains everything calculated to
        impart joy to their minds, and in which He so often promises to send
        them the Comforter. ‘These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy in
        you might remain, and that your joy might be full.’ He had spoken to
        them that their joy might be full, but He makes no such addition when He
        refers to His joy in them, for it was already full. This joy in His
        people is an everlasting joy, neither capable of increase nor
        diminution; but their joy is variable according as they are exercising
        faith in Him, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of
        the Holy Ghost. Joy is one of the great blessings of His kingdom. In
        this passage peace is placed before joy, while joy is elsewhere put
        before peace, as in the following chapter, ver. 13, and especially in
        enumerating the fruits of the Spirit, Galatians 5:22. The first feeling
        on receiving the knowledge of the Gospel of salvation will be joy, and
        peace or tranquillity of mind will immediately succeed the agitations of
        the troubled conscience. However, where the one exists, there will the
        other be found, and in an equal proportion. Peace and righteousness are
        here traced up to joy in the Holy Ghost, which shows, as in other
        places, that it is in effect before the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to
        God, and approved of men.
      </p>
      <p>
        For he that in these things serveth Christ. — Here the Christian is said
        to serve Christ by righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ, then, must be God. Is any but God to be served? Are we servants
        or slaves to any but God? Here we are represented as the slaves of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the service of God? Is it not righteousness, and peace, and joy
        in the Holy Ghost? And here this service is considered the service of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can there be any doubt, then, that Christ is God? Acceptable to God —
        Every righteous man is pleasing to God. But without faith it is
        impossible to please Him. Then without faith it is impossible to live
        righteously, to live in true peace, and in the joy of the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the things in which God is honored. What a contrast between
        this account, as given by Paul, and the religion of the Church of Rome
        at the present time! If men abstain from meats, and observe the laws of
        the Church, they are acknowledged as members of that Church, though they
        should live unrighteously, though they should be agitators or disturbers
        of society, though they should have no joy in believing. How unlike,
        then, is the Church of Rome now to that of Rome addressed by the
        Apostle! Approved of men. — When Christians live as becometh the Gospel,
        they have a testimony from their very enemies. The conduct here
        recommended is eminently useful to society, and cannot but command the
        approbation even of the most ungodly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — Let us therefore follow after the things which make for
        peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace. — Since,
        then, meats have nothing to do in the religion of Christ; for ‘meat
        commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better:
        neither, if we eat not, are we the worse,’ 1 Corinthians 8:8; and since
        He is served by righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, let
        us pursue the things of peace. We are not only to live peaceably with
        all men, and especially with the brethren, but we are to pursue peace.
        Even should it fly from us, we should follow it. The things of peace. —
        That is, we should follow all things that tend to produce peace, and
        avoid everything, as far as our duty to God permits, of a contrary
        tendency. And things wherewith one may edify another, — the things of
        edification. — That is, such things as will have a tendency to increase
        the faith and establishment of each other. We are not to have an eye
        merely to our own growth and stability, but also to the growth and
        stability of the whole body. Christians in general are not sufficiently
        aware of this duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
        pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For meat destroy not the work of God. — The believer is here called the
        work of God, in a like sense as believers are elsewhere called the
        building of God. Dr. Macknight understands it of ‘that which God is
        working in the heart of our brother, namely, faith and holiness.’ The
        other sense seems to be the true one. The reason which he gives for not
        applying the word to persons, is not to be sustained: ‘For if,’ says he,
        ‘the Apostle had been speaking of persons who, on account of their
        regeneration, are called the work of God, he would have used the word
        poi >hma , as he does Ephesians 2:10.’ Why should he be confined to this
        word? The other word is equally applicable. Mr. Stuart alleges that, as
        referring to the internal work of faith, it is a possible meaning,
        though he prefers the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        His observation, however, that faith is called the work of God, John
        6:29, has no weight in confirming Dr. Macknight’s opinion. Work of God
        in that passage signifies not the work which God works, but the work
        which God enjoins. The question was, ‘What shall we do that we might
        work the works of God?’ This surely is the work which God enjoins, not
        the work which God works. When, therefore, in answer to this question,
        Jesus replies, ‘This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He
        hath sent,’ the work of God must also refer to the work which God
        requests. But it may be asked, How can this be, seeing faith is not a
        work?
      </p>
      <p>
        The reply is quite obvious: it is in an allusive sense only, as has been
        already observed, that faith is here called a work. The word is used
        merely in reference to the word in the question. It is not a work, but
        it is the thing that God enjoins in order to salvation. The Scriptures
        abound with examples of this manner of speaking. Dr. Macknight observes
        ‘that the Apostle’s words, so interpreted, imply that the truly
        regenerated may be destroyed.’ But as it is contrary to the whole
        current of Scripture that the truly regenerated can eternally perish —
        for who shall separate them from the love of Christ? — it must be
        understood in the sense already explained, of tending in itself to his
        destruction. All things indeed are pure. — Every kind of meat is here
        declared to be pure. This at once shows that the abolition of the law
        had already taken place, and that blood is not in itself unclean. But it
        is evil for that man who eateth with offense. — Some understand the
        offense as referring to the man who causes another to stumble, and some
        to the man who stumbles through offense. Calvin appears to understand it
        in the former sense. But the other meaning appears to be the right one.
        The meaning of ‘with offense’ seems to be, that the eating by the person
        referred to is Occasioned by the stumbling block which was laid before
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor
        anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is good. — The Apostle here extends the duty not only to the things
        that were prohibited by the Mosaic law, but to every kind of flesh, and
        even wine, and every other thing that might be the occasion of causing a
        weak brother to stumble. Nor anything. — The expression in the original
        is elliptical; and this elliptical translation is preferable to that of
        Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight and Mr. Stuart, who supply the phrase to do. Without doubt,
        the words to be supplied, as left out by ellipsis, are to eat or to
        drink. This is the very way in which Mr. Stuart himself, in his
        Commentary, supplies the ellipsis. Why, then, does he translate on
        another principle? The Apostle declares that it is wrong to eat or to
        drink anything that would be the occasion of bringing sin upon our
        brother. Whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
        — The first of these words may refer to stumbling without falling; the
        second, to falling by a stumbling block; and the third, to the effect of
        this upon the person who is stumbling — he becomes weak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he
        that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. — It is of no importance
        whether we read this as a question, with our version, or as a
        declaration of a known fact. The meaning is substantially the same. Mr.
        Macknight does not seem justifiable in representing the word translated
        have as a command to hold fast this faith. The man who has faith should
        not disturb his weak brother with an unseasonable declaration of his
        faith in this matter. His belief in this point is correct; and let him
        rejoice before God in his privilege; but let him not wound the mind of
        his weak brother by an injudicious exercise of his privileges. He is
        accountable to God for his faith in this matter as well as in all
        others. But he is not to intrude it upon his weak brother. Calvin well
        observes, ‘This passage is evidently perverted and misunderstood when it
        is adduced to support the opinion that a person may observe foolish and
        superstitious ceremonies without danger, provided his conscience is pure
        and undisturbed before God. The context clearly confutes such a
        misconstruction.’ A Christian may forego his liberty with respect to
        meats and drinks, but he has no right to practice what God has not
        enjoined, nor to avoid practicing what God has instituted. Happy is he
        that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. — That man
        is happy, and he only can enjoy peace in his conscience, who acts
        according to the persuasion which he has of the lawfulness of his
        conduct. And happy is it for the Christian when his just views are not
        acted on in such a manner as to stumble others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
        not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
      </p>

        And he that doubteth is damned if he eat. — That is, he that doubteth
        whether it be right to eat the meats forbidden by the law, is in this
        condemned, although the thing itself is lawful. The reason is obvious.
        The person does not fully believe that the thing is right, and
        consequently by eating he thinks he may be offending God. This shows us
        that in the things of God we ought not to do anything concerning which
        we are in doubt. To observe any ordinance of God with doubts as to its
        being an ordinance of God, is to commit sin. To obey God acceptably, we
        must have a conviction that we are doing the thing which He has
        enjoined. Calvin observes on this passage, ‘For if we are not allowed to
        take a single mouthful of bread with a doubting conscience, how much
        greater caution ought to be used in transactions of the highest
        importance?’ For whatsoever is not of faith is sin. — That is,
        whatsoever is not done with a conviction that it is agreeable to the
        will of God, is sinful in the doer, although it should be right in
        itself. This is the generalization of the preceding doctrine. It applies
        not merely to meats, but to everything. If any person be convinced that
        a thing is contrary to God’s law, and yet practices it, he is guilty
        before God, although it should be found that the thing was lawful.
