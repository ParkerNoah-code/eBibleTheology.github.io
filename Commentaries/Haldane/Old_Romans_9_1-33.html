      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 9:1-33</p>
      <p>
        THROUGH the whole of the doctrinal part of this Epistle, Paul has an eye
        to the state and character of the Jewish nation, and the aspect which
        the Gospel bears towards them. In the preceding chapters, he had
        exhibited that righteousness which God has provided for men, all of whom
        are entirely divested of any righteousness of their own, ‘none being
        righteous, no, not one.’ He had discoursed largely on the justification
        and sanctification of believers, and now he proceeds to treat
        particularly of the doctrine of predestination, and to exhibit the
        sovereignty of God in His dealings both towards Jews and Gentiles. The
        way in which, in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters, he so
        particularly adverts to the present state and future destination of the
        Jews, in connection with what regards the Gentiles, furnishes the most
        ample opportunity for the illustration of this highly important subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eighth chapter, the Apostle had declared the glorious and exalted
        privileges of the people of God. But it was impossible for one so
        ardently attached to his own nation, and so zealously concerned for the
        welfare of his countrymen, not to be touched with the melancholy
        contrast which naturally arose to his mind, as he turned from these
        lofty and cheering contemplations to consider the deplorable state of
        apostate Israel. If there was a people upon earth to whom, more than to
        another, the blessings of the Gospel belonged as a birthright, it was
        assuredly to the descendants, according to the flesh, of Abraham, of
        Isaac, and of Jacob. But they had willfully rebelled against their God;
        they had rejected the Messiah, and consequently forfeited the rights and
        immunities secured to their forefathers by covenant. Their condition was
        therefore itself well calculated to awaken the sympathies of Paul; while
        at the same time it was necessary to vindicate the faithfulness of God,
        and to prove that the rejection of the Jews was by no means opposed to
        the absolute security of God’s elect, on which he had been so largely
        expatiating. This subject is therefore discussed in the three following
        chapters; and as it is one of the greatest importance, so also it is
        introduced in a manner the most appropriate and the most affecting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely has his sublime conclusion to the eighth chapter terminated,
        when, at the beginning of the ninth, the triumphant language of victory
        is exchanged by the Apostle for the voice of commiseration, in which he
        bewails the apostasy of his countrymen. He does not dwell so much upon
        the magnitude of their guilt, as he does upon the memory of their
        ancestral glory and ancient privileges. He strongly affirms the ardor of
        his affection for them as his brethren, and feelingly deplores the
        misery of their rejected condition. Finally, he turns from this scene of
        ruin and degradation, to declare that their apostasy, though general,
        was not universal, and to predict the dawn of a brighter day, which
        shall yet make manifest the truth and faithfulness of their covenant
        God, whose purposes concerning Israel had evidently alike included their
        present rejection and future restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rejection of Israel, Paul proves to have been from the earliest
        periods of their history prefigured by God’s dealing towards them as a
        nation. For, after declaring that ‘they are not all Israel which are of
        Israel,’ he adduces various and conclusive testimonies in confirmation
        of this truth, and thus forcibly illustrates the conduct of God towards
        the natural descendants of Abraham. In following this course of
        argument, he draws a solemn and most impressive picture of the
        sovereignty of God in the general administration of His government, and
        asserts the distinction which God makes between vessels of wrath and
        vessels of mercy, in order ‘that He might make known the riches of His
        glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory.’
        He further affirms the calling of a portion both of Jews and Gentiles,
        with whom in combination he classes himself as one of those ‘called of
        God,’ concerning whom he had, in the preceding chapter, so largely
        discoursed. The introduction of the Gentiles into the Church of Christ,
        as well as of a remnant or portion of the Jews, being thus clearly
        intimated, he shows that both of these events had been expressly
        foretold by the Prophets, who had also affirmed that except the Lord of
        Sabbath had left them a seed, the national ruin of Israel would have
        been as complete as that of Sodom and Gomorrah.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had thus two great objects in view. In the first place, he
        illustrates the sovereignty of God as exhibited in the infallible
        accomplishment of the Divine purposes predicted by the Prophets, which
        led to the national rejection of the Jews, with the exception of a
        remnant who were saved by grace. In the second place, he proves that the
        poses of God were equally fulfilled in bringing in the Gentiles; and
        this he does in such a way as to cut off, on their part, all pretensions
        to everything like merit, desert, or worthiness, since, without seeking
        for it, they attained to the righteousness which is of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having established these two important truths with great force and
        clearness, Paul accounts for the fact of the Jews having stumbled at and
        rejected the Messiah. He shows that the Messiah had been characterized
        by the Prophets as ‘that stumbling stone’ which God had laid in Zion;
        and that the Jews stumbled in consequence of their ignorance of the
        righteousness which God had provided in the fulfillment of His violated
        law, and of their vain attempt to establish a righteousness of their
        own.
      </p>
      <p>
        His discussion of this topic is thus most appropriately introduced. It
        is also in the last degree important, as furnishing additional
        confirmation of the sovereignty of God, which is here exhibited in the
        certainty of the accomplishment of His purposes; while it is testified
        how well merited was that punishment of rejecting and casting off the
        great body of the Jews. Paul sums up the whole, by appealing, at the end
        of the tenth chapter, to the testimonies of Moses and Isaiah, in
        confirmation of what he had advanced. But still, as the apostasy was so
        general, it might be concluded that God had for ever cast off the Jewish
        nation, and had thus made void the promises made to the fathers. This
        error he once more encounters and largely confutes in the eleventh
        chapter, where he shows most conclusively that, in whatever form it
        presents itself, it cannot abide the test of truth. So far is this from
        being the case, that, in the infallible dispensations of God, a period
        will arrive when the Redeemer shall come out of Zion, and turn away
        ungodliness from Jacob; when the whole of Israel shall, as one people,
        be brought within the bond of that new covenant established with the
        house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, of the blessings of which
        they shall all partake. The three following chapters thus hold a very
        distinguished place in this most instructive Epistle, and exhibit in a
        manner the most comprehensive, as well as conspicuous and edifying, the
        sovereignty of God in the government of the world, and the character of
        His dealings towards men in the whole of the Divine administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the nation of Israel were types of the true Israel, and as their
        rejection might seem, as has been observed, to militate against the
        security of the people of God, it was necessary in this ninth chapter to
        enter fully upon the subject. It was, however, one sure to be highly
        offensive to the Jews; and therefore Paul introduces it in a manner
        calculated, as far as possible, to allay their prejudices against him,
        while at the same time he does not in this matter shun to declare the
        whole counsel of God, for the instruction of those to whom he wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        After expressing the grief with which he contemplated his countrymen,
        without specifying its cause, he enumerates their distinguished
        privileges as a nation. He then adverts to their being rejected of God,
        though not directly mentioning it; and begins with observing that it
        could not be said that among them the word of God had taken none effect.
        God had promised to be a God to Abraham and to his seed; and although
        the greater part of Israel were now cast off, that promise had not
        failed. When God said to Abraham, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be called,’
        He intimated that the promise did not refer to all his children, but to
        a select number. Isaac was given to Abraham by the special promise of
        Jehovah; and further, in the case of Rebecca, one of her children was a
        child of promise, the other was not, and this was intimated before they
        were born. In order to silence all objections against this proceeding,
        as if the Almighty could be charged with injustice, Paul at once appeals
        to the sovereignty of God, who disposes of His creatures as to Him seems
        good. Especially he refers to what God had said to Moses, as recorded in
        the Scriptures, when He made all His goodness to pass before him, that
        He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy, — thus intimating that
        His favors were His own, and that in bestowing or withholding them there
        was no room for injustice. Against this view of God’s sovereignty, the
        pride of man, until subdued by grace, rises with rebellious violence;
        but such is its importance — such its tendency to abase the sinner and
        exalt the Savior — that Paul dwells on it in both its aspects, not only
        as exhibited in the exercise of mercy on whom He will, but also in
        hardening whom He will. In acting both in the one way and the other, he
        declares that God contemplates His own glory. This leads the Apostle
        immediately to the election of those whom God had prepared to be vessels
        of mercy, both from among the Jews and the Gentiles. These in reality
        were the only children of promise of whom Isaac was a type, Galatians
        4:28. On the other hand, the rejection of the great body of Israel, so
        far from being contrary to the Divine purpose, had been distinctly
        predicted by their own Prophets. He closes the chapter by showing that,
        while this rejection had taken place according to the counsel of God,
        its immediate occasion was the culpable ignorance and prejudice of the
        Jews themselves in seeking acceptance with God by their own
        righteousness, instead of submitting to the righteousness of God brought
        in by the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
        The manner in which Paul has treated the subject of this chapter,
        furnishes an opportunity of illustrating the doctrine of election to
        eternal life, to which, in the one preceding, he had traced up, as to
        their origin, all the privileges of believers in Christ. It likewise
        gives occasion to exhibit the sovereignty of God as all along displayed
        respecting the nation of Israel In this manner the astonishing fact is
        at the same time accounted for, that so great a portion of the Jews had
        rejected the promised Messiah, while a remnant among them at that time,
        as in every preceding age, acknowledged Him as their Lord. Mr. Stuart
        says that ‘with the eighth chapter concludes what may appropriately be
        termed the doctrine part of our Epistle.’ But if the sovereignty of God
        be a doctrine of Divine revelation, this assertion is evidently
        erroneous. Without the development of this important doctrine, which
        accounts for the fact of the election of some, and the rejection of
        others, the Epistle would not be complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
        bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        I say the truth. — The Jews regarded the Apostle Paul as their most
        determined enemy. What, therefore, he was about to declare concerning
        his great sorrow on account of the present state of his countrymen,
        would not easily procure from them credit. Yet it was a truth which he
        could affirm without hypocrisy, and with the greatest sincerity. In
        Christ. — Paul was speaking as one united to, and belonging to, Christ —
        acting as in His service. This is a most solemn asseveration, and
        implies that what he was affirming was as true as if Christ Himself had
        spoken it. A reference to Christ would have no weight with the Jews. It
        appears, therefore, that the Apostle adopted this solemn language
        chiefly with a view of impressing those whom he addresses with a
        conviction of his sincerity, and also to prove that what he was about to
        say respecting the rejection of the Jewish nation did not arise, as
        might be supposed, from any prejudice or dislike to his countrymen. I
        lie not. — this is a repetition, but not properly tautology. In certain
        situations an assertion may be frequently in substance repeated, as
        indicating the earnestness of the speaker. The Apostle dwells on the
        statement, and is not willing to leave it without producing the effect.
        My conscience also bearing me witness. — For the sincerity of his love
        for the Jewish nation, the Apostle appeals to his conscience. His
        countrymen and others might deem him their enemy: they might consider
        all his conduct towards them as influenced by hatred; but he had the
        testimony of his conscience to the contrary. In the holy Ghost. — He not
        only had the testimony of his conscience, but what precluded the
        possibility of his deceiving, he spoke in the Holy Ghost — he spoke by
        inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2, 3. — That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my
        heart (for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ) for my
        brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many interpretations have been given of this passage. Calvin supposes
        that Paul, actually in ‘a state of ecstasy,’ wished himself condemned in
        the place of his countrymen. ‘The additional sentence,’ he says, ‘proves
        the Apostle to be speaking not of temporal, but eternal death; and when
        he says from Christ, an allusion is made to the Greek word anathema,
        which means a separation from anything. Does not separation from Christ
        mean, being excluded from all hopes of salvation?’ Such a thing is
        impossible, and would be highly improper. This would do more than
        fulfill the demands of the law, — it would utterly go beyond the law,
        and would therefore be sinful; for all our affections ought to be
        regulated by the law of God. Some understand it of excommunication. But
        the Apostle could not be excommunicated by Christ, except for a cause
        which would exclude him from heaven, as well as from the church on
        earth. He could not be excommunicated without being guilty of some sin
        that manifested him to be an unbeliever. It is not possible that one
        speaking in the Holy Ghost could wish to be in such a state. Paul’s
        affection for his countrymen is here indeed expressed in very strong
        terms, but the meaning often ascribed to it is not for a moment to be
        admitted. That any one should desire to be eternally separated from
        Christ, and consequently punished with everlasting destruction from the
        presence of the Lord, is impossible. The law commands us to love our
        neighbor as ourselves, but not more than ourselves, which would be the
        case, if to promote his temporal or spiritual benefit we desired to be
        eternally miserable. It should also be recollected, that it is not only
        everlasting misery, but desperate and final enmity against God, that is
        comprised in Paul’s wish as it is generally understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        It represents him as loving the creature more than the Creator. But who
        could ever imagine that the desire of being eternally wicked, and of
        indulging everlasting hatred to God, could proceed from love to Christ,
        and be a proper manner of expressing zeal for His glory? It would be
        strange indeed if Paul, who had just been affirming, in a tone so
        triumphant, the impossibility of the combined efforts of creation to
        separate him from the love of Christ, should, the moment after, solemnly
        desire that this separation should take place, for the sake of any
        creature, however beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the meaning of this passage, there are three observations
        to which it is of importance to attend. In the first place, it is the
        past, and not the present tense, which is employed in the original. What
        is rendered ‘I could wish,’ should be read in the past tense, ‘I was
        wishing, or did wish,’ referring to the Apostle’s state before his
        conversion. The second observation is, that the verb which in our
        version is translated ‘wish,’ would have been more correctly rendered in
        this place boast; ‘for I myself boasted, or made it my boast, to be
        separated from Christ.’ For this translation, which makes the Apostle’s
        meaning far more explicit, there is the most unquestionable authority.
        The third observation is, that the first part of the 3rd verse should be
        read in a parenthesis, as follows: ‘I have great heaviness and continual
        sorrow in my heart (for I myself made it my boast to be separated from
        Christ) for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.’ By the
        usual interpretation, the Apostle is understood to say, ‘I have great
        heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart,’ and without stating for
        whom or for what, to add, ‘I could wish that myself were accursed from
        Christ for my brethren.’ But it appears evident that these words, for my
        brethren, form the conclusion of the above expression, I have great
        heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. Paul had himself formerly
        made it his boast to be separated from Christ, rejecting Him as the
        Messiah; and to prove how much he sympathized with the situation of his
        countrymen, in the bosom of his lamentation over their fallen state, he
        appeals to his former experience, when, before his conversion, he had
        been in the same unbelief, and personally knew their deplorable
        condition. He also intimates his sorrow in such a manner as to show that
        he is far from glorying over them, having been himself as deeply guilty
        as they were; while, according to the doctrine he was inculcating, it
        was in no respect to be ascribed to his own merits that he was happily
        delivered from that awful condemnation in which, with grief, he beheld
        them now standing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul’s sorrow was for those whom he calls his brethren. This does not
        respect a spiritual relationship, as the term brethren so generally
        denotes in the New Testament, but natural relationship, as Paul here
        explains it when he adds, my kinsmen according to the flesh. His sorrow
        for them is the subject of his testimony, which, in a manner so solemn,
        he had confirmed in the preceding verse. Instead of glorying over their
        calamities and rejection, he forgot his own wrongs, and their cruel
        persecutions, in the inexpressible affliction with which he contemplated
        their obstinate unbelief with all its fatal consequences. In this we may
        discern a characteristic of a Christian. He who has no sorrow for the
        perishing state of sinners, and especially of his kindred, is not a
        Christian. No man can be a Christian who is unconcerned for the
        salvation of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the
        glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of
        God, and the promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here recognizes and enumerates the great external privileges
        belonging to the Jews, which aggravated his profound sorrow, on account
        of their rejection of the Messiah, and their consequent deplorable
        condition. Who are Israelites. — That is, the most honorable people on
        earth; the descendants of him who, as a prince, had power with God. They
        had the name, because that of Israel was given to Jacob their father by
        God, when vouchsafing so striking a pre-intimation of His future
        manifestation in the flesh. Adoption. — That is, the nation of Israel
        was a nation adopted by God as a type of the adoption of His children in
        Christ Jesus; and in that typical sense, in which they were the children
        of God as no other nation ever was, they are frequently spoken of in
        Scripture, Exodus 4:22; Jeremiah 31:9-20. In this way our Lord Himself
        recognizes them, when anticipating their rejection, He says, ‘The
        children of the kingdom shall be cast out,’ Matthew 8:12. Glory. — This
        most probably refers to the manifestation of the glory of God over the
        mercy-seat in the sanctuary.
      </p>
      <p>
        God, too, set His tabernacle among the Israelites, and walked among
        them, which was their peculiar glory, by which they were distinguished
        from all other nations, Deuteronomy 4:32-36 The glory of the Lord
        appeared in the cloud that went before them in he wilderness. It often
        filled the tabernacle and the temple. His house was the place of His
        glory. Covenants. — The covenant with Abraham, and the covenant at
        Sinai, in both of which they were interested, and all the solemn
        engagements which God had entered into with mankind, were lodged in
        their hands and committed to their custody. Giving of the law. — To them
        the law was given at Mount Sinai; and they were the only people on earth
        so distinguished by God. The service of God. — This refers to the
        tabernacle and temple service, or Mosaic institutions of worship. All
        other nations were left to their own superstitious inventions; the Jews
        alone had ordinances of worship from God. Promises. — The Jews had
        received the promises, both temporal and spiritual, especially those
        that related to the Messiah, Acts 2:39.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — Whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh,
        Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whose are the fathers. — The Jews numbered among their illustrious
        progenitors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with others to whom God had been
        pleased to manifest Himself in a manner so remarkable. Of whom, as
        concerning the flesh, Christ came. — This was the completion of all the
        privileges which the Apostle here enumerates. It was a signal honor to
        the Jewish nation, that the Messiah was by descent an Israelite.
        Concerning the flesh. — This declares that He was really a man having
        truly the human nature, and as a man of Jewish origin. At the same time
        it imports that He had another nature. Who is over all, God blessed for
        ever. — This is a most clear and unequivocal attestation of the Divine
        nature of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every engine of false criticism has
        been employed by those who are desirous to evade the obvious meaning of
        this decisive testimony to the Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ; but
        they have never even plausibly succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The awful blindness and obstinacy of Arians and Socinians in their
        explanations, or rather perversions, of the word of God, are in nothing
        more obvious than in their attempts to evade the meaning of this
        celebrated testimony to the Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ. They often
        shelter themselves under various readings; but here they have no tenable
        ground for an evasion of this kind. Yet, strange to say, some of them
        have, without the authority of manuscripts, altered the original, in
        order that it may suit their purpose. There is no difficulty in the
        words — no intricacy in the construction; yet, by a forced construction
        and an unnatural punctuation, they have endeavored to turn away this
        testimony from its obvious import. Contrary to the genius and idiom of
        the Greek — contrary to all the usual rules of interpreting language, as
        has often been incontrovertibly shown — they substitute ‘God be
        blessed,’ for ‘God be blessed for ever;’ or, ‘God, who is over all, be
        blessed,’ instead of, ‘who is over all, God blessed for ever.’ Such
        tortuous explanations are not only rejected by a sound interpretation of
        the original, but manifest themselves to be unnatural, even to the most
        illiterate who exercise an unprejudiced Judgment. The Scriptures have
        many real difficulties, which are calculated to try or to increase the
        faith and patience of the Christian, and are evidently designed to
        enlarge his acquaintance with the word of God, by obliging him more
        diligently to search into them, and place his dependence on the Spirit
        of all truth. But when language so clear as in the present passage is
        perverted, to avoid recognizing the obvious truth contained in the
        Divine testimony, it more fully manifests the depravity of human nature,
        and the rooted enmity of the carnal mind against God, than the grossest
        works of the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        After speaking of the Messiah’s coming through the nation of Israel, in
        respect to His human nature, the Apostle, in order to enhance the
        greatness of this extraordinary distinction conferred upon it, here
        refers to His Divine nature, to union with which, in one person, His
        human nature was exalted. The declaration of His coming in the flesh
        clearly imports, as has been remarked, that Christ had another nature.
        When it is said, John 4:3, that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh —
        which could not be said of a mere man, who could come in no other way —
        it shows that He might have come in another way, and therefore implies
        His pre-existence, which is asserted in a variety of passages of
        Scripture. Of such passages there are four orders. The first order
        consists of those where His incarnation is ascribed to Himself. ‘Behold,
        I will send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and
        the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple,’ Malachi 3:1.
        These words manifestly prove that His incarnation, and the preparation
        for it, such as the mission of John the Baptist, was a work of the
        Messiah Himself, and consequently that He existed before His
        incarnation. The same truth is declared, when it is said, ‘For as much,
        then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself
        took part of the same; for verily He took not on Him the nature of
        angels; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham,’ Hebrews 2:14,16. Here
        His taking upon Him flesh and blood is represented to be by an act of
        His own will. The same truth is taught where He is introduced as
        addressing the Father in these terms. ‘Sacrifice and offering Thou
        wouldst not, but a body hast Thou prepared me: in burnt-offerings and
        sacrifices for sin Thou hast had no pleasure: then said I, Lo, I come
        (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do Thy will, O God,’
        Hebrews 10:5,7; and again, ‘Jesus Christ, being in the form of God,
        thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made Himself of no
        reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant,’ Philippians 2:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we are taught that Jesus Christ Himself took this form, and
        consequently existed before He took it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second order of passages, asserting the pre-existence of our Lord,
        are those which expressly declare that Jesus Christ was in heaven before
        He came into the world. ‘No man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that
        came down from heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in heaven.’ And a
        little after, ‘He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
        earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: He that cometh from heaven
        is above all,’ John 3:13-31. ‘The bread of God is He which cometh down
        from heaven,’ John 6:33,41,50,51,58. ‘For I came down from heaven, not
        to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me,’ John 6:38. ‘What
        and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before? ‘ John
        6:62. ‘And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own self with the
        glory which I had with Thee before the world was,’ John 17:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third order of passages ascribes actions to Jesus Christ before His
        birth. ‘By whom,’ says the Apostle, God ‘made the worlds,’ Hebrews 1:2,
        which signifies the creation of the universe; and verse 3, ‘upholding
        all things by the word of His power,’ which signifies His providence;
        and verse 10, ‘And Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation
        of the earth; and the heavens are the works of Thine hands.’ This is
        part of the response of the Father in the <19A225> 25th verse of the
        102nd Psalm to His Son, complaining that He had weakened His strength in
        the way, and praying not to be taken away in the midst of His days; to
        which the Father immediately answers, ‘Thy years are throughout all
        generations,’ and continues His reply to the end of the Psalm. ‘One Lord
        Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,’ 1 Corinthians 8:6, which implies
        both creation and preservation. ‘Who is the image of the invisible God,
        the firstborn of every creature; for by Him were all things created that
        are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether
        they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things
        were created by Him, and for Him; and He is before all things, and by
        Him all things consist,’ Colossians 1:15,16. Here Jesus Christ is
        declared to be the Creator of all things. This is also affirmed
        concerning Him before His incarnation, John 1:3. ‘Being put to death in
        the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit; by which also He went and
        preached unto the spirits in prison,’ 1 Peter 3:19. The Son of God
        preached by His Spirit to the inhabitants of the earth before the flood,
        who are now in the prison of hell, which supposes His existence before
        He was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fourth order of passages clearly proves the pre-existence of our Lord
        Jesus Christ. ‘This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man, which
        is preferred before me; for He was before me,’ John 1:15,30. He could
        not be before John unless He had existed prior to his birth, since John
        was born before Him. ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham
        was, I am,’ John 8:58. ‘But thou, Bethlehem-Ephratah, though thou be
        little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth
        unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from
        of old, from everlasting,’ Micah 5:2. ‘I am Alpha and Omega, the
        beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and
        which is to come, the Almighty.’ ‘I am Alpha and Omega, the first and
        the last.’ ‘I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first
        and the last,’ Revelation 1:8-11, 22:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        To all these passages must be added that of Proverbs 8:(compared with 1
        Corinthians 1:24), where Wisdom is declared to have existed when God
        formed the universe; and also John 1:1, ‘In the beginning was the Word,
        and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.’ Than this last passage
        nothing could more explicitly declare the pre-existence and Godhead of
        our Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are few of the predictions concerning the Messiah in which His two
        natures are not marked. In the first of them, ‘the seed of the woman’
        denotes His humanity; while the words, ‘He shall bruise thy head,’
        declare His divinity. In the promise to Abraham, His humanity is marked
        by the words, ‘in thy seed;’ while in what follows, ‘shall all the
        nations of the earth be blessed,’ we read His divinity. ‘I know that my
        Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the
        earth’ — this is His divinity. ‘Whom I shall see for myself, and mine
        eyes shall behold’ — this is His humanity. ‘Behold, a virgin shall
        conceive, and bear a son’ — this is His humanity; ‘and shall call His
        name Immanuel’ — this is His divinity. ‘Unto us a child is born, unto us
        a son is given’ — this marks His humanity. ‘The government shall be upon
        His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The
        Mighty God, the Everlasting Father’ — these words denote His Godhead.
        There are multitudes of other passages in the Prophets to the same
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way the two natures of Jesus Christ are spoken of in
        numerous passages in the New Testament. ‘The Word was God,’ and ‘The
        Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.’ ‘Made of the seed of David
        according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power,
        according to the Spirit of holiness.’ ‘God was manifest in the flesh.’
        The same distinction appeared in His actions, and almost all His
        miracles. Finally, this truth discovers itself in all the most
        remarkable parts of His economy. In His birth He is laid in a manger as
        a man, but it is announced by the hallelujahs of angels, and the ‘wise
        men,’ led by a star, come to adore Him as God. At the commencement of
        His public ministry He is baptized in water, but the heavens open to
        Him, and the Father proclaims from heaven, ‘This is My beloved Son, in
        whom I am well pleased.’ In His temptation in the desert He suffers
        hunger and thirst, but angels come and minister to their Lord. In the
        garden of Gethsemane He seems as if he were ready to sink under the
        agonies He endures; but more than twelve legions of the angelic host
        stand ready to fulfill His mandates, and prostrate His enemies in the
        dust. In His death He hangs like a malefactor upon the cross, but as
        Jehovah He bestows paradise upon the dying robber.
      </p>
      <p>
        In completing the enumeration of the signal honors conferred on the
        nation of Israel, after having declared that of them the Messiah, as
        concerning the flesh, came, the reason is obvious why the Apostle
        immediately referred to our Lord’s Divine nature. Had he spoken only of
        Christ’s coming in the flesh, it would not have enhanced as he intended
        the high and unparalleled privileges by which his countrymen had been
        distinguished. It was necessary, both for this end, and in order fully
        to portray the character of Him of whom he spoke, to subjoin, ‘who is
        over all, God blessed for ever.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This addition, then, is not superfluous, or that might have been
        omitted. It is indispensable, being essential to the Apostle’s argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this great truth respecting the coming of God manifest in the flesh,
        as the foundation on which the whole work of redemption rests, the
        Apostle subjoins, Amen . In the same way he adds Amen to the expression,
        ‘who is blessed for ever,’ Romans 1:25, applying it to the Creator. Amen
        signifies truth, stability, or is an affirmation, or expresses consent.
        In the New Testament Jesus Christ alone makes use of this term at the
        beginning of sentences, as a word of affirmation. In this sense it
        appears to be employed at the end of each of the four Gospels. In the
        Gospel of John only have we any record oŁ the Lord using this word more
        than once in the same sentence, Amen, amen, or Verily, verily. The Lord
        employs it again and again in His Sermon on the Mount, the purpose of
        which, it would seems was to impress on the minds of His hearers both
        the truth of what He said, and its importance. Luke, who records this
        term less frequent than the other evangelists, sometimes substitutes in
        place of it a simple affirmation, Luke 9:27; Matthew 16:28. Jesus, in
        addressing the seven churches of Asia, after dividing his glorious
        attributes and names amongst them, finally denominates Himself ‘the
        Amen,’ Revelation 3:14; and God is called the God Amen, Isaiah 65:16.
        The Apostle John, in his ascription of praise to the Redeemer, adds
        Amen, as he does in the contemplation of His second coming in glory to
        judge the world, Revelation 1:6,7; and also in closing the canon of
        Scripture, when he repeats the declaration of Jesus, that He will come
        quickly, and after his prayer that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
        may be with all the churches to which he writes, Revelation 22:20,21.
        The Lord Himself makes use of this term when He declares that He liveth,
        and was dead, and is alive for evermore, Revelation 1:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they
        are not all Israel which are of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not as though. — That is, my grief for the state of the Jewish nation,
        and their rejection by God, does not imply that with regard to them
        anything said in the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel
        which are of Israel. — Here is the explanation of the mystery that the
        Jews, as a nation, had rejected the Messiah: they are not all true
        Israelites in the spiritual sense of the promise, who are Israelites
        after the flesh. The Jews might object, and say that if they were cast
        off and rejected, then God is unfaithful, and His promises are
        ineffectual. To this Paul answers by making a distinction among
        Israelites. Some are Israelites only in respect of their carnal descent,
        and others are children of the promise. ‘The proposition of the
        Apostle,’ says Calvin, ‘is that the promise was given in such a manner
        to Abraham and his seed, that the inheritance has no particular regard
        to every one of his descendants; and it hence follows, as a consequence,
        that the revolt of certain individuals from the Lord, who derive their
        birth from the father of the faithful, has no effect in preventing the
        stability, permanence, and steadfastness of the Divine covenant. The
        common election of the Israelitish nation does not prevent the Sovereign
        of infinite holiness from choosing for Himself, according to His secret
        counsel, whatever portion of that people He has determined to save. When
        Paul says they are not all Israel which are of Israel, and afterwards,
        neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children, he
        includes all the descendants of the father of believers under one member
        of the sentence, and points out by the other those only who are true and
        genuine sons of the friend of God, and not a degenerate race.’ Through
        the remaining part of this chapter, the Apostle shows that the rejection
        of the Messiah by the great body of the Jewish nation was neither
        contrary to the promises nor the purpose of God, but had been
        predetermined and also typified in His dealings towards individuals
        among their progenitors, as recorded in the Scriptures, and also there
        predicted. This furnishes an opportunity of more fully illustrating the
        doctrine of God’s sovereignty in choosing some to everlasting life,
        which had been spoken of in the 29th and 30th verses of the preceding
        chapter, and of His rejection of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
        children: but In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children. —
        In the preceding verse the Apostle had shown that there was a difference
        among Israelites; now he refers to a difference in the seed of Abraham.
        The error of the Jews was, that they thought they were the children of
        God by being the children of Abraham. But in this, as the Apostle
        declares, they were in error. The promise to Abraham and his seed was
        not made to him and all his descendants in general, but to him and a
        particular seed. As the children of Abraham, they were all, indeed, in
        one sense the children of God. God says to Pharaoh with respect to them,
        ‘Let my son go.’ But the natural sonship was only a figure of the
        spiritual sonship of all believers of every nation. None but such are
        the spiritual seed of Abraham, whether among Jews or Gentiles. But in
        Isaac shall thy seed be called. — Reckoned, chosen, or called into
        existence, as it is said respecting the birth of Isaac in the fourth
        chapter, ‘God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which
        be not as though they were.’ The Messiah, who was emphatically the seed
        of Abraham, says ‘The Lord hath called Me from the womb, Isaiah 49:1.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was called into existence in His human nature, and to His office of
        Mediator, in the line of Isaac. And Israel was called or chosen as God’s
        people, Isaiah 48:12. ‘Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called.’
        In this sense the expression called is used in the end of the 11th
        verse. By thus appealing to the declaration of God to Abraham, that in
        Isaac his seed should be called — and reckoned more especially the seed
        of Abraham — the Apostle showed that, notwithstanding the defection of
        the great body of the nation of Israel which he so much deplored, it was
        by no means the case that the word of God had taken none effect; for
        from the beginning a distinction had been made among the descendants of
        Abraham, indicating that they are not all Israel which are of Israel.
        Only a part of that nation, which he calls a remnant, verse 27, and
        afterwards ‘a remnant according to the election of grace,’ ch. 11:5, was
        to participate in the spiritual blessings to be conveyed by promise.
        ‘When,’ says Calvin, ‘we see in the two first sons of the patriarch, the
        younger chosen by a recent promise ( Genesis 21:12; Hebrews 11:18),
        while the older was yet living, how much more might this take place in a
        long line of descendants! This prediction is taken from Genesis 17:20,
        where the Lord answers Abraham, As for Ishmael, I have heard thy
        prayers, but the blessing shall be granted to the son of Sarah, and the
        covenant established with Isaac. It hence follows as a consequence that
        certain individuals are, by a singular privilege, chosen from the elect
        people of the Jews, in whom the common adoption is ratified and rendered
        efficacious.’ It may be further remarked that when it is said, ‘In Isaac
        shall thy seed be called,’ it did not imply that all the descendants of
        Isaac were to be the spiritual seed of Abraham. Only such were to be so
        who belonged to that seed to which the word, being used in the singular,
        emphatically and exclusively applied, as the Apostle declares, Galatians
        3:16, ‘Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
        And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
        Christ.’ The meaning, then, of the declaration, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed
        be called,’ is, that as all Abraham’s posterity were not to be the
        peculiar people whom God was nationally to adopt as His children, but
        only such as should descend from Isaac, so not all the Jews are the true
        sons of God, but only such as, like Isaac, are children of the promise.
        Here it is evident, as also from Galatians 4:28, that Isaac the child of
        promise was typical of all believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are
        not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for
        the seed.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, or this explains, the declaration, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be
        called.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is intended to show that not carnal descent, but being included in
        the promise, constituted the true spiritual seed. This clearly
        establishes the difference between the sonship of Israel after the
        flesh, and the sonship of Israel after the Spirit. The nation of Israel
        stood in a relation to God in which no other nation was ever placed; but
        only a part of them enjoyed a spiritual relation. Hence the distinction
        here noted, that the children of the flesh are not the children of God,
        but the children of the promise are counted for the seed a distinction
        which the Apostle also makes, ch. 2:28, between being a Jew outwardly,
        and a Jew inwardly. These distinctions are explanatory of the
        declaration, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be called,’ and of the rejection
        of the other children, though the seed of Abraham. In the Epistle to the
        Galatians, 4:22, it is said that ‘Abraham had two sons, the one by a
        bond maid, the other by a free woman.’ This appears in the original
        history to be a merely accidental and unimportant matter; but in that
        place we are taught that it was a shadow of futurity. Ishmael, who was
        of the bond woman, it is said, was ‘born after the flesh.’ This denoted
        that though he was descended from Abraham according to the laws of
        nature, he was not a son of Abraham’s faith. Isaac was also in a certain
        sense born like Ishmael after the flesh, because he was naturally
        descended from Abraham; but not of the flesh merely, nor of the flesh
        naturally, — for according to the course of nature he never would have
        been born, — but at the same time he was more. He was not only a son of
        Abraham’s flesh, but his son as born after the Spirit, because he was
        given to Abraham, after, by the course of nature, he could not hope for
        children.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this indicated the distinction that existed in the nation of Israel,
        between those who, notwithstanding their being born in the line of
        Isaac, were the seed of Abraham merely by carnal descent, and not the
        children of God by a spiritual regeneration. Only these last were the
        children of the promise, as Isaac was, who were all one in Christ Jesus,
        and therefore in the highest sense Abraham’s seed, and ‘heirs according
        to the promise,’ Galatians 3:29 — heirs of all the spiritual blessings
        secured to Abraham by promise. ‘Paul,’ says Calvin, ‘now deduces from
        the prophecy a proposition containing his whole meaning, intent, and
        aim. For if the seed is called in Isaac, not in Ishmael, and this latter
        is no less a son of the patriarch Abraham than the former, all his
        children by lineal descent cannot be reckoned as his seed; but the
        promise is in an especial and peculiar manner fulfilled by some, but has
        not a common and equal regard to all. Children by lineal descent mean
        such as are not distinguished by a more excellent privilege than their
        being offspring by blood; children of the promise are those who are
        peculiarly marked out and sealed by their Heavenly Father.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
        Sarah shall have a son.
      </p>
      <p>
        The birth of Isaac was by promise, and without a miracle it would never
        have taken place. But the birth of Ishmael was not by promise, but in
        the ordinary course of nature. Thus the children of God specially
        promised to Abraham were those who, according to the election of God
        (who had chosen Isaac in preference to Ishmael), were to come into a
        spiritual relation with Christ, who is emphatically the promised seed in
        the line of Isaac, Galatians 3:16. To them the spiritual blessings were
        restricted, while only the temporal advantages of the national covenant
        belonged to the whole of Israel. This was intimated in God’s dealings
        with Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by
        one, even by our father Isaac; Not only in the case of Isaac was the
        election limited to him as the son of promise, but also in a still more
        remarkable instance was this truth indicated in the case of the two sons
        of Isaac. They were conceived by Rebecca of the same husband, yet God
        chose the one and rejected the other. An original difference between
        Isaac and Ishmael might be alleged, since the one was born of the lawful
        wife of Abraham, the free woman, and the other was the son of the bond
        woman; but in the case now brought forward there existed no original
        difference. Both were sons of the same father and mother, and both were
        born at the same time. The great distinction, then, made between the two
        brothers could only be traced to the sovereign will of God, who thus
        visibly notified, long before the event, the difference of the Divine
        purpose, according to election, towards the people of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — (For the children being not yet born, neither have done any
        good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand,
        not of works, but of Him that calleth;) In the case of Isaac and
        Ishmael, it might still be said, that as the latter, as soon as he came
        to years, gave evidence of a wicked disposition, this was a sufficient
        reason for preferring Isaac. But here, in a parenthesis the Apostle
        shows that the preference was given to Jacob independently of all ground
        of merit, because it was made before the children were capable of doing
        either good or evil. This was done for the very purpose of taking away
        all pretense for merit as a ground of preference. Had the preference
        been given to Jacob when he had grown up to maturity, there would have
        been no more real ground for ascribing it to anything good in him; yet
        that use would have been made of it by the perverse ingenuity of man.
        But God made the preference before the children were born. That the
        purpose of God according to election might stand — This was the very end
        and intention of the early indication of the will of God to Rebecca, the
        mother of the two children. It was hereby clearly established that, in
        choosing Jacob and rejecting Esau, God had respect to nothing but His
        own purpose. Than this what can more strongly declare His own eternal
        purpose to be the ground of all His favor to man? Not of works but of
        Him that calleth. — Expressions indicating God’s sovereignty in this
        matter are heaped upon one another, because it is a thing so offensive
        to the human mind. Yet, after all the Apostle’s precaution, the
        perverseness of men still finds ground of boasting on account of works.
        Though the children had done neither good nor evil, yet God, it is
        supposed, might foresee that Jacob would be a godly man, and Esau
        wicked. But had not God made a difference between Jacob and Esau, Jacob
        would have been no better than his brother. Were not men blinded by
        opposition to this part of the will of God, would they not perceive that
        a preference on account of foreseen good works is a preference on
        account of works, and therefore expressly contrary to the assertion of
        the Apostle — Not of works, but of Him that calleth? The whole ground of
        preference is in Him that calleth, or chooseth, not in him that is
        called. ‘Paul,’ says Calvin, ‘had hitherto merely observed, in a few
        words, the difference between the carnal sons of Abraham; namely, though
        all by circumcision were made partakers of the covenant, yet the grace
        of God was not equally efficacious in all, and the sons of the promise
        enjoy the blessings of the Most High. He now plainly refers the whole
        cause to the gratuitous election of God, which in no respects depends on
        men, so that nothing can be traced in the salvation of believers higher
        than the goodness of God; nothing in the destruction of the reprobate
        can be discovered higher than the just severity of the Sovereign of the
        world. The first proposition of the Apostle is the following: — As the
        blessing of the covenant separates the nation of the Israelites from all
        other people, so the election of God separates the men of that nation,
        while He predestinates some to salvation, others to eternal damnation.
        The second proposition is, that there is no other foundation of election
        than the mere goodness and mercy of God, which embrace whom He chooses,
        without paying the least regard to works, even after the fall of Adam.
        Third, the Lord in His gratuitous election is free and unrestrained by
        the necessity of bestowing the same grace equally on all; He passes by
        such as He wills, and chooses for His own according to His will. Paul
        briefly comprehends all these propositions in one clause, and will
        afterwards consider other points. The following words, when they were
        not yet born, neither had done any good or evil, show that God, in
        making the difference between them, could have paid no regard to their
        works, which did not yet exist. Sophists, who state that God may elect
        from among mankind by a respect to their works, since He foresees from
        their future conduct who may be worthy or deserving of grace, attack a
        principle of theology which no Christian ought to be ignorant of;
        namely, that God can regard nothing in the corrupt nature of man, such
        as that of Jacob and Esau was, by which He may be induced to do them
        kindness. When, therefore, Paul says that neither of the children had
        done any good or evil, we must add also the opinion which he had already
        formed in his mind, of their both being children of Adam, sinners by
        nature, not possessed of a single particle of righteousness. Besides,
        although the vicious and depraved nature, which is diffused through the
        whole human race, be of itself sufficient to cause damnation before it
        has shown its unholiness by any act or deed, and Esau therefore deserved
        to be rejected, because he was by nature a child of wrath, yet to
        prevent the least difficulty, as if the state of the elder was worse
        with respect to the perpetration of any offense or vice than that of the
        younger, it was necessary for the Apostle to exclude the consideration
        both of transgressions and of virtues. I confess, indeed, that it is
        true that the near cause of reprobation is our being all cursed in Adam;
        but Paul withdraws us in the meantime from this consideration, that we
        may learn to rest in the naked and simple good pleasure of God, until he
        shall have established this doctrine, that the infinite Sovereign has a
        sufficiently just cause for election and reprobation, in His own will.
        He here urges, in almost every word, the gratuitous election of God; for
        had he considered works to have any place in our election, he would have
        stated the remuneration due to their performance. But he opposes to
        works the purpose of God, which consists in the good pleasure of His
        will. And to remove all doubts and controversy concerning the subject,
        he adds, according to election, and closes in a striking manner, — not
        of works, but of Him that calleth. The opinion, therefore, that God
        elects or reprobates every one according as He foresees good or evil in
        us, is false, and contrary to the word of eternal truth.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 12. — It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</p>
      <p>
        This was a figure of the spiritual election, for in no other point of
        view is it here to the Apostle’s purpose. Not only did God choose one of
        these sons, who were equal as to their parentage, but chose that one who
        was inferior in priority of birth, the only point in which there was a
        difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        He chose the younger son, contrary to the usual custom of mankind, and
        contrary to the law of primogeniture established by God Himself
        respecting inheritances in the family of Jacob. The dominion of the
        younger, then, over the elder, flowed, as is shown in the nest verse,
        from God’s love to the one and hatred to the other; thus proving the
        election of the one and the reprobation of the other. This strikingly
        exemplified the manner of God’s dealings towards the nation of Israel,
        in discriminating between those who were the children of the flesh, and
        the others who were the children of God. How much instruction do these
        words, ‘The elder shall serve the younger,’ contain, as standing in the
        connection in which they are here placed, as well as in that part of
        Scripture from which they are quoted! They practically teach the great
        fundamental doctrines of the\parPRESCIENCE, thePROVIDENCE,
        theSOVEREIGNTY of God; His\parPREDESTINATION,ELECTION, andREPROBATION.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is written. — Here and elsewhere it is remarkable that the writers
        of the New Testament, and our Lord Himself, generally, or at least very
        often, simply say, It is written,. This is on the principle that the
        word Scripture signifies the word of God. Scripture literally signifies
        writing, and may refer to any writing; but in the appropriated sense, it
        signifies the written word of God. It is written, then, signifies, it is
        written in the word of God. When the Apostles refer in this manner to
        the Scriptures, they do it as adducing authority which is conclusive and
        not to be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The words here quoted from Malachi expressly relate to Jacob and Esau.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Prophet likewise declares the dealing of God towards their
        posterity, but the part here referred to applies to the progenitors
        themselves. God is there reproving the people of Israel for their
        ingratitude, and manifesting His great goodness to them in loving their
        father Jacob, while He hated his brother Esau, and gave him a
        mountainous, barren country, as a sign of His hatred. Thus God preferred
        Jacob before Esau without respect to the goodness or wickedness of
        either, attaching good things to the one, and evil to the other, before
        they were born. And this quotation by the Apostle is intended to prove
        that the purpose of God, in choosing who shall be His children according
        to election, might stand, not by works, but of Him that calleth, verse
        11, which shows that all along the reference is to spiritual and eternal
        blessings, shadowed forth, as is usual in the Prophets, by things that
        are temporal and carnal. In the same place God likewise declares His
        dealings towards the posterity of Esau; but the words here quoted
        expressly refer to Jacob and Esau personally. The Apostle is speaking of
        heads of nations; and in God’s dealings towards them is found the reason
        of the difference of the treatment of their posterities. The
        introduction of Jacob and Esau personally, presents an emblem of this,
        while the design is to show that some among the Israelites were the
        children of God, and not others. That the Apostle quotes these words in
        reference to Jacob and Esau personally, is clear, since he speaks of
        them before they were born, and declares their conception by one mother,
        of one father, which could not be said of their posterity. Jacob have I
        loved, but Esau have I hated. — Jacob was loved before he was born,
        consequently before he was capable of doing good; and Esau was hated
        before he was born, consequently before he was capable of doing evil. It
        may be asked why God hated him before he sinned personally; and human
        wisdom has proved its folly, by endeavoring to soften the word hated
        into something less than hatred: but the man who submits like a little
        child to the word of God, will find no difficulty in seeing in what
        sense Esau was worthy of the hatred of God before he was born. He sinned
        in Adam, and was therefore properly an object of God’s hatred as well as
        fallen Adam. There is no other view that will ever account for this
        language and this treatment of Esau. By nature, too, he was a wicked
        creature, conceived in sin, although his faculties were not expanded, or
        his innate depravity developed, which God, who hath mercy on whom He
        will have mercy, and hardeneth whom He will, and who giveth no account
        of His matters, did not see good to counteract by His grace, as in the
        case of Jacob, who originally was equally wicked, and by nature, like
        Esau, a child of wrath and a fit object of hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not unusual to take part with Esau who was rejected, against Jacob
        who was the object of Divine favor. Everything that can be made to
        appear either amiable or virtuous in the character of Esau is eagerly
        grasped at, and exhibited in the most advantageous light. We are told of
        his disinterestedness, frankness, and generosity; while we are reminded
        that Jacob was a cool, selfish, designing man, who was always watching
        to take advantage of his brother’s simplicity, and who ungenerously and
        unjustly robbed his elder brother of the blessing and the birthright.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way of reasoning shows more zeal for the interest of a cause than
        discretion in its support. Instead of invalidating, it only serves to
        confirm the truth it opposes. While it is evident that Jacob possessed
        the fear of God, which was not the case with respect to Esau, — and
        therefore that the one was born of God, and the other remained a child
        of nature, — yet there is so much palpable imperfection and evil in
        Jacob, as to manifest that God did not choose him for the excellence of
        his foreseen works. In maintaining, then, the doctrine of the
        sovereignty of God, it is by no means necessary to vindicate the conduct
        of Jacob towards his brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both he and his mother were undoubtedly to blame, much to blame, as to
        the way in which he obtained his father’s blessing, to the prejudice of
        Esau, while the revealed purpose of God formed no apology for their
        conduct. That sin is an evil thing and a bitter, Jacob fully
        experienced. His conduct in that transaction led him into a maze of
        troubles, from which through life he was never disentangled. While Jacob
        was a man of God, and Esau a man of the world, there is enough to show
        that the inheritance was bestowed on the former not of works but of
        grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing can more clearly manifest the strong opposition of the human
        mind to the doctrine of the Divine sovereignty, than the violence which
        human ingenuity has employed to wrest the expression, Jacob have I
        loved, but Esau have I hated. By many this has been explained, ‘Esau
        have I loved less.’ But Esau was not the object of any degree of the
        Divine love, and the word hate never signifies to love less. The
        occurrence of the word in that expression, ‘hate father and mother,’
        Luke 14:26, has been alleged in vindication of this explanation; but the
        word in this last phrase is used figuratively, and in a manner that
        cannot be mistaken. Although hatred is not meant to be asserted, yet
        hatred is the thing that is literally expressed. By a strong figure of
        speech, that is called hatred which resembles it in its effects. We will
        not obey those whom we hate, if we can avoid it. Just so, if our parents
        command us to disobey Jesus Christ, we must not obey them; and this is
        called hatred, figuratively, from the resemblance of its effects. But in
        this passage, in which the expression, ‘Esau have I hatred’ occurs,
        everything is literal. The Apostle is reasoning from premises to a
        conclusion. Besides, the contrast of loving Jacob with hating Esau,
        shows that the last phrase is literal and proper hatred. If God’s love
        to Jacob was real literal love, God’s hatred to Esau must be real
        literal hatred. It might as well be said that the phrase, ‘Jacob have I
        loved,’ does not signify that God really loved Jacob, but that to love
        here signifies only to hate less, and that all that is meant by the
        expression, is that God hated Jacob less than he hated Esau. If every
        man’s own mind is a sufficient security against concluding the meaning
        to be, ‘Jacob have I hated less,’ his judgment ought to be a security
        against the equally unwarrantable meaning, ‘Esau have I loved less.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But why, it may be asked of those who object to the plain meaning of the
        words, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated, and insist that their
        import is that God loved Esau less than Jacob — why should God love Esau
        less than Jacob, and that, too, before the children were born, or had
        done good or evil? Can they explain this? Would it not involve a
        difficulty which, even on their own principles, they are unable to
        remove? Why then refuse to admit the natural and obvious signification
        of the passage? If God says that He hated Esau, are we to avoid
        receiving God’s testimony, or justified in employing a mode of torture
        in expounding His words? If, again, Esau, as some insist, were the
        better character, why was Jacob preferred to him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Others translate the word in the original by the term slighted. But if
        God had no just ground to hate Esau, He could have as little ground for
        slighting him. Why should Esau be unjustly slighted before he was born,
        more than unjustly hated? However, those who entertain a proper sense of
        man’s guilt by nature, will be at no loss to discern the ground of God’s
        hatred of Esau. Both Jacob and Esau were, like David, shapen in iniquity
        and conceived in sin, and were in themselves sinners. Esau was justly
        the object of hatred before he was born, because he was viewed in Adam
        as a sinner. Jacob was justly the object of God’s love before he was
        born, because he was viewed in Christ as righteous. That the terms love
        and hatred are here to be understood in their full and proper import, is
        evident from the question put in the 14th verse, and answered in the
        15th, 16th, and 17th verses, with the conclusion drawn in the 18th.
        ‘Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He
        hardeneth.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Compassion is a sign of love, and hardening a proof of hatred. And,
        besides this, the expression, ‘Esau have I hatred,’ is not stronger than
        what the Apostle applies to all men when he says that by nature they are
        the children of wrath, dead in trespasses and sins, and consequently
        objects of the hatred of the holy and just God. All of them are so in
        their natural state, as considered in themselves, and all of them
        continue to be so, unless delivered from that state by the
        distinguishing grace of God. To be hated on account of Adam’s sin and of
        their own corrupt nature, is common to all men with Esau who are not of
        the elect of God; and in Esau’s case this is exhibited in one instance.
        Nothing, then, is said of Esau here that might not be said of every man
        who shall finally perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are few commentators, however, who have not wavered more or less
        in their explanation of this passage. Mr. Hodge, Professor of Biblical
        Literature in the Theological Seminary at Princeton, America, gives here
        the following most erroneous interpretation: ‘It is evident that in this
        case the word hate means to love less, to regard and treat with less
        favor.’ This false gloss completely destroys the import of the passage,
        on which no one who understands the doctrine of the fall, and consequent
        condemnation of all men in Adam, ought to feel the smallest difficulty.
        In its obvious and literal meaning, what is said of Jacob and Esau must
        be true of all the individuals of the human race before they are born.
        Each one of them must either be loved or hated of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opinion held by some, that it may be questioned whether God be ever
        said to hate any man, is contrary to the revealed character of God. This
        sentiment appears to be near akin to that of the heathen philosophers,
        who held it as a maxim that God could not be angry with any one. Like
        many other unfounded dogmas, it stands in direct opposition to the whole
        tenor of the Scriptures, which represent God as angry with the wicked
        every day, and hating all workers of iniquity, Psalm 5:5. Does not the
        passage above quoted, which declares that men are by nature children of
        wrath, express this hatred of sin in the strongest manner; and
        especially of Adam’s sin, on account of which all men are children of
        wrath by nature?
      </p>
      <p>
        And does not this wrath abide on all them that believe not on the Son?
        John 3:36. ‘The Lord will take vengeance on His adversaries, and He
        reserveth wrath for His enemies,’ Nahum 1:2.
      </p>
      <p>
        In innumerable passages of Scripture, God ascribes to Himself hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men, however, are averse to this. What, then, can be done? The
        Scriptures must be explained in a forced manner; and while they say that
        God hates sinners, they are made to say that He does not hate them.
        Nothing can be more unjustifiable than this method of tampering with and
        perverting the word of God, and nothing can be more uncalled for. Hatred
        in itself is not sinful. That which is sinful ought to be hated; and
        though there is a mixture of evil in man’s hatred of evil, yet there is
        the same mixture of evil in his love of good. In God’s hatred of
        sinners, as in all His attributes, there is nothing of sinful feeling.
        We are not able to comprehend this attribute of the Divine mind; but
        every other attribute has also its difficulties. We must in this, and in
        all things, submit to God’s word, and believe it as it speaks, and not
        as we would have it to speak.

        Respecting God’s hatred of sin, and the punishment of transgressors, the
        late Dr. Thomson refers in his sermons to the following passages: —
        ’Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written
        in the book of the law to do them. The wrath of God has been revealed
        from heaven against all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men.
        Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, will be rendered to
        every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the
        Gentile. God is love; but it is also said, that God hates all workers of
        iniquity; — that the Lord revengeth, and is furious; — that His wrath
        cometh on the children of disobedience. The assertion that God is angry
        with the wicked every day, is just as level to our apprehension, as the
        assertion that God loves them that fear Him. We know that His anger is
        expressed in rebuking, chastening, punishing those who have provoked it,
        as we know that pity helps, relieves, comforts those who stand in need
        of its interposition. God is as certainly holy to hate sin, and just to
        inflict merited punishment on the sinner, as He is good and merciful,
        and compassionate to the guilty and the miserable for whom He
        interposed.’ ‘I cannot help reverting to what I formerly observed
        respecting the necessity of attributing love to God no further than His
        own word has warranted, and no further than is consistent with that
        revelation of His character which He Himself has given us. A greater
        snare cannot be laid for your piety and your judgment, than that which
        consists in making love His paramount or His only perfection. For
        whenever there is a consciousness of guilt, and a dread of
        responsibility, it must be comfortable to have a God who is divested of
        all that is frowning and indignant towards transgressors, and clothed
        with all that is compassionate and kind. And whenever there is a soft or
        a sentimental temperament at work, that representation of the Divine
        nature must be peculiarly pleasing and acceptable. And whenever men wish
        to have a religion which will be without any rigorous exactions of
        self-denial and of duty, and without any tendency to excite apprehension
        and alarm, the same predictions must exist for a supreme Ruler in whose
        benevolence all other qualities are absorbed and lost. And, accordingly,
        not only is this partial and unscriptural view of the character of God
        adopted as the leading principle of certain systems of theology, but it
        is held and cherished and acted upon by multitudes, whose sole concern
        in matters of faith is to have not what is true, but what is agreeable,
        and who find in the tenet we are speaking of, the most soothing and
        satisfying of all persuasions, — that God loves every one of His
        creatures with such an affection as is depicted in the Gospel. I warn
        you against the delusion — so dishonorable to the Holy One, the
        Everlasting Father — so ruinous to all who have surrendered themselves
        to its influence — so inconsistent with what you read in the book of
        inspiration — so destructive of that mystery of godliness and of grace
        which has been made known to us in Jesus Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Scriptures teach us that judgment has passed upon all men in Adam,
        and that it is altogether of grace that any of the human race are saved.
        Mr. Tholuck, in his exposition of this chapter, may speak most
        irreverently of God as destroying His hapless creatures, and quote the
        Apocrypha, which asserts that God does not abhor anything which He has
        made, from which it would follow that He does not abhor devils for whom
        everlasting fire is prepared; but the uniform doctrine of Scripture is,
        that man is self-destroyed, and that it was God’s eternal purpose to
        make known His manifold wisdom by the redemption of the Church, chosen
        in Christ before the foundation of the world. When the Savior was first
        announced, Genesis 3:15, mankind were divided into two classes, the one
        to be saved, the other to be lost. To the latter God did no wrong. He
        left them under condemnation, as is here exemplified in the case of
        Esau, while He plucked the former, like Jacob, as brands from the
        burning; and we are expressly told that in this case of Jacob and Esau
        the reception of the younger, and the rejection of the elder, which were
        declared previously to their birth, was in order that the purpose of God
        according to election might stand. This doctrine of the election of some
        and the rejection of others was also illustrated in Abraham, an
        idolater, and in the nation of Israel, to whom God showed His word,
        while He left all other nations to walk in their own ways. Had the whole
        of Adam’s race perished, God would only have dealt with them as He did
        with the fallen angels. Why then, it may be said, preach the Gospel to
        all men? Because it is the appointed means of the salvation of sinners;
        and while all naturally reject it, God makes His people willing in the
        day of His power, and produces in them faith by what they hear. Paul
        endured all things for the elect’s sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        He used the means, knowing that God would give the increase. The
        election thus obtain life, and the rest are blinded by the God of this
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ishmael was rejected, and Isaac was chosen before he was born; and in
        the same way Jacob the younger was preferred to Esau his elder brother —
        Jacob was loved, but Esau was hated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage in Malachi, from which these words, ‘Esau have I hated,’ are
        quoted by the Apostle, proves what is meant by the expression in the
        verse before us. ‘I have loved you, saith the Lord: yet ye say, Wherein
        hast Thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the Lord: yet I
        loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
        waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Whereas Edom saith, We are
        impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus
        saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and
        they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against
        whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.’ Here the Prophet first speaks
        of Esau personally as Jacob’s brother, which clearly indicates the
        meaning attached by the Apostle to the quotation. It implies, too, that
        Jacob had no claim to be preferred to his brother. Afterwards, in the
        denunciation, Esau’s descendants are spoken of under the name of Edom,
        when the singular is changed for the plural, and the past time for the
        future and the present.
      </p>
      <p>
        The denunciation of indignation for ever upon the Edomites, and the call
        of God to Israel to observe the difference of His dealings towards them,
        shows what is meant by God’s love of Jacob, and His hatred of Esau.
      </p>
      <p>
        The declarations of God by the Prophet in the above quoted passage are
        fully substantiated throughout the Scriptures, both in regard to His
        loving Jacob and hating Esau personally; and likewise in regard to the
        indignation which He manifested against Esau’s descendants. Jacob is
        everywhere spoken of as the servant of God, highly honored by many
        Divine communications. Jacob wrestled with God, and had power over Him,
        and prevailed, Hosea 12:4,5. With his dying breath, when he declared
        that he had waited for the salvation of the Lord, he was honored to
        announce as a prophet the future destinies of his sons, and, above all,
        to utter a most remarkable prediction concerning the advent of the
        Messiah. Jacob during his life was the object of many special blessings.
        He died in faith, Hebrews 11:13,21; and of him the Redeemer Himself has
        testified that, with Abraham and Isaac, he is now in the kingdom of
        heaven, Matthew 8:11. Concerning Jacob, such is the decisive testimony
        of the Scriptures, which cannot be broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the life of Esau, nothing is recorded indicating that he had the fear
        of God before his eyes, but everything to prove the reverse. The most
        important transaction recorded concerning him is his profane contempt
        for God’s blessing in selling his birthright, manifesting his unbelief
        and indifference respecting the promise to Abraham. We see him also
        taking women of Canaan as his wives, although he had the example before
        him of Abraham’s concern that Isaac should not marry any of the
        daughters of that country. In this we observe that he held as lightly
        the curse denounced against Canaan as he did the blessing promised to
        Abraham. We next see him deliberately resolving to murder his brother.
        ‘The days of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I slay my
        brother Jacob.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Long after, although restrained from violence, he goes out to meet him
        with an armed force. At last he turns his back on the habitation of his
        fathers, and departs for ever from the land of promise. Towards the
        conclusion of the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the sale of his
        birthright is referred to, and where Jacob is numbered among those who
        both lived and died in faith, Esau is characterized as ‘a profane
        person,’ Hebrews 12:16. The same word, translated profane, is employed
        by Paul in his enumeration to Timothy of the most horrible vices, when
        speaking of the ‘ungodly, of sinners, and of unholy persons,’ 1 Timothy
        1:9. The selling of his birthright proved Esau to be an unbelieving,
        profane, and ungodly man, and the Apostle warns believers not to act
        according to his example. The birthright conferred a double inheritance
        among the Hebrew patriarchs, and likewise pre-eminence, because it was
        connected with the descent of the Messiah; and they to whom this right
        belonged were also types of the firstborn, whose names are written in
        heaven. Despising the birthright proved that he despised the high
        distinction respecting the coming of the Messiah, and also the eternal
        inheritance of which the land of Canaan and the double portion of the
        firstborn were typical. Here the question of Esau’s character as an
        ungodly man is decided by the pen of inspiration long after his death.
        And is this ‘profane person,’ who not only despised the birthright
        fraught with such unspeakable privileges, but who had deliberately made
        up his mind revengefully to murder his brother in cold blood, to be
        viewed as he has been represented, as amiable, disinterested, and
        virtuous, in defiance of every moral principle, and in direct opposition
        to the testimony of the word of God?
      </p>
      <p>
        Such is the account which the Scriptures give of Esau personally; and
        how fully the denunciations above quoted from the Prophet respecting his
        descendants were accomplished, we learn from numerous passages
        throughout the Scriptures, as Ezekiel 25:12,14; Joel 3:19; Amos 1:11,
        and elsewhere; and from the whole of the prophecy of Obadiah, where the
        destruction of Edom, and the victories of the house of Jacob, are
        contrasted. ‘But upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall
        be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. And
        the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and
        the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour
        them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau: for the
        Lord hath spoken it.’ Is it then in the unambiguous testimony of
        Scripture respecting Esau personally, as a profane person, and
        respecting his descendants, ‘the people against whom the Lord hath
        indignation for ever,’ — is it among the many indications of God’s
        goodness to Jacob, — that we find any countenance given to the
        imagination that God loved Esau only in a less degree than He loved
        Jacob? When men, by such methods as are resorted to on this subject,
        pervert the obvious meaning of the word of God, in order to maintain
        their preconceived systems, it manifests deplorable disaffection to the
        truth of God, and most culpable inattention to His plainest
        declarations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is evident that the quotation from the Old Testament of these words,
        ‘Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated,’ is here made by the Apostle
        with the design of illustrating the great truth which he is laboring
        through the whole of this chapter to substantiate; namely, that in the
        rejection of the great body of the Jewish nation, as being ‘vessels of
        wrath,’ while He reserved for Himself a remnant among them as ‘vessels
        of mercy,’ verses 22, 23, neither the purpose nor the promises of God
        had failed. In proof of this, Paul asserts that all the seed of Abraham
        were not the children of God, and that God had plainly exhibited this
        truth in distinguishing and choosing Isaac, that in his line, in
        preference to that of Abraham’s other children, the Redeemer should
        come; and in further proof, he adduces the still stronger example of
        God’s loving Jacob and hating Esau, choosing the one and rejecting the
        other. And as the manner of God’s procedure is so contrary to the
        opinion which men naturally form of the way in which He should act, the
        Apostle immediately after affirms that in this there is no
        unrighteousness in God, and fully proves in what follows, that so far
        from being contrary to His usual mode of procedure, it is strictly in
        accordance with it, both in showing mercy on the one hand, according to
        His sovereign pleasure, and, on the other, in displaying His hatred of
        those whom He hardens. Having thus asserted that such is God’s manner of
        acting towards men, which, being established, ought to stop every mouth,
        the Apostle at once shuts the door against all impious reasonings on the
        subject, and indignantly demands of any one who should dare to
        controvert this view of the subject, — Nay but, O man, who art thou that
        repliest against God?
      </p>
      <p>
        Such persons, then, as deny that the expression, ‘Jacob have I loved,
        but Esau have I hated,’ imports literal love of the one and literal
        hatred of the other, viewing it as an isolated declaration, detached
        from its connection, and judging of it from their preconceived opinions,
        as if such a manner of acting were unworthy of God, not only disregard
        the usual legitimate rules of interpreting language, and employ a most
        unwarrantable mode of torture in expounding these words, but prove that
        they misapprehend the whole drift of the Apostle’s argument, and have no
        discernment of his purpose in introducing this example. For how would
        God’s rejection of a part of the nation of Israel as ‘vessels of wrath,’
        and His reserving a remnant among them as ‘vessels of mercy,’ be
        illustrated by His loving Esau only less than Jacob? Does the idea of
        loving less consist with the idea held forth in the expression vessels
        of WRATH?
      </p>
      <p>
        Several commentators deny that the declaration, ‘Jacob have I loved, but
        Esau have I hated,’ has any reference to their personal, spiritual, and
        eternal state. ‘It is certain,’ says Dr. Doddridge, ‘the Apostle does
        not here speak of the eternal state of Jacob and Esau, nor does he
        indeed so much speak of their persons as of their posterity, since it is
        plainly to that posterity that both the prophecies which he quotes in
        support of his argument refer.’ On this Mr. Fry remarks, ‘If so, the
        force and pertinency of the Apostle’s reasonings are lost. In attending,
        however, to the Apostle’s argument in the passage before us, it will
        appear plain to every inquirer, who is not biased by the apprehension of
        certain Consequences, supposed to result from this interpretation, that
        St. Paul does certainly consider Jacob and Esau to be personally
        referred to, and concerned in these prophecies which he quotes; and that
        with them personally, and not altogether with their respective seeds,
        has his argument to do. The Apostle is showing that the rejection of the
        natural descendants of the patriarchs does not argue a breach of that
        word of God, which promises eternal mercies to Abraham and his seed,
        because by that seed was not intended all the seed born to Abraham after
        the flesh, but a seed of true believers, of whom Abraham, in the view of
        God, was the constituted father. In confirmation of this, he refers to
        the case of Ishmael, who was rejected, and of all the other children of
        Abraham being passed over in silence, Isaac remaining the only seed to
        inherit and to entail the promise. Again, as a still more striking proof
        that the word of promise discriminated a particular seed, and addressed
        not the children of the flesh universally, the Apostle instances the
        cases of Jacob and Esau. The first of these is chosen of God, and
        invested with the promised blessing; the other is rejected, and that in
        circumstances, as he points out to us, which plainly show that of the
        descendants of the patriarchs, God, according to His will and pleasure,
        would make some, and not others, to be counted to Abraham for a “seed”
        in a spiritual sense, to be of the children of God. It is evident,
        therefore, that the Apostle means to assert that Jacob was counted for
        one of “the” spiritual “seed,” was “a child of God,” and that Esau,
        though one of “the children” of Abraham “according to the flesh,” was
        “not a child of God,” nor “counted for the seed;” and, moreover, that it
        was the election of God, and no merit or demerit of the parties, which
        made this difference between them. It follows that whatever these
        prophecies may refer to besides, if we admit that the Apostle understood
        them, they do refer most certainly to Jacob and Esau personally; nay
        more, are quoted by the Apostle with this reference alone. For though in
        these prophecies, as they stand in the Scriptures of the Old Testament,
        a doom was certainly pronounced, which affected very materially the
        posterity of Jacob and Esau, and the children of the former were elected
        to privileges, from the inheritance of which the children of the latter
        were excluded, yet the Apostle does not quote the prophecies in this
        sense. That were in fact to overturn his own argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because, if what was prognosticated of the respective posterities of the
        persons mentioned in the prophecies were the object in view, it would
        prove that the children of the flesh, as far, at least, as the children
        of Israel were concerned, were counted for the seed. But the Apostle’s
        argument goes to prove that the reverse is the case, — that they are not
        all Israel who are of Israel. With respect to the natural privileges and
        the pre-eminence which was given to Jacob and denied to Esau, as the
        representatives of their respective seeds, it would not stand true that
        they were not all Israel who were of Israel. The privileges in question
        had been enjoyed by the children of the flesh, and have just been
        enumerated as possessed by those very Israelites whose rejection from
        being the children of God the Apostle is now deploring, while, at the
        same time, he proves that rejection not contrary to the promises made to
        the fathers. We may therefore safely conclude that the Apostle does not
        so much speak of the posterity, as of the persons of Jacob and Esau; and
        that he knew the prophecies he quotes in support of his argument not to
        refer alone to that posterity; and consequently that it is certain he
        does speak of the eternal state of Jacob and Esau.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole of the context throughout this ninth chapter, as well as the
        concluding part of the eighth, proves that respecting Jacob and Esau the
        reference is to their spiritual and eternal state. At the 29th verse of
        the preceding chapter, the Apostle, after exhibiting to believers
        various topics of the richest consolation, had traced up all their high
        privileges to the eternal purpose of God, and had dwelt in the sequel on
        their perfect security as His elect. In the beginning of this chapter,
        he had turned his eye, with deep lamentation, to the very different
        state of his countrymen, who, notwithstanding all their distinguished
        advantages, had rejected the Messiah. This gave occasion for enlarging
        on the sovereignty of God in the opposite aspect to that in which he had
        treated it in respect to believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reference to believers, he had spoken of God’s sovereignty as
        displaying itself in their election, and now, in reference to the great
        body Of the Jews, as manifested in their rejection. By this arrangement,
        an opportunity was afforded most strikingly to exhibit that doctrine, by
        personal application in both cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is evident that Paul, throughout this chapter, refers not to the
        external condition of the Jews, which was indeed involved in their
        rejection of Christ, but to their spiritual state, as rejecting the
        righteousness which is of faith, and stumbling at that stumbling stone,
        verse 32. He observes that not only at that time, but in former ages,
        according to the testimony of their own Prophets, a remnant only should
        be saved. And, besides, while the whole tenor of his discourse makes it
        obvious that he is treating of their spiritual and eternal condition,
        this is conclusively evident from what he says in the 22nd and 23rd
        verses above referred to, where he speaks, on the one hand, of the
        vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction, and, on the other, of the
        vessels of mercy, prepared unto glory. These two verses, were there no
        other proof, evince beyond all doubt what is his object. His lamentation
        for his countrymen was not called forth on account of the loss of their
        external privileges, the destruction of Jerusalem, and their expulsion
        from their own land. Had it been so, he must have included himself, and
        also those Jews whom, in the 24th verse, he says God had called. But so
        far is he from representing these to be in a lamentable state, that he
        describes them, along with himself, as vessels on whom the riches of the
        glory of God was made known; while, by the contrast, it is evident that
        by the wrath and destruction of which the others were vessels, he means
        something very different from temporal calamities. The vessels of the
        one description were the ‘remnant’ which should be saved, the ‘seed’
        which the Lord of Sabbath had left, verses 27, 29. The vessels of the
        other description were these who were as ‘Sodom, and had been made like
        unto Gomorrah,’ which suffered the vengeance of eternal fire. What
        trifling, then, what wresting of this important portion of the word of
        God, what turning of it entirely away from its true meaning, to
        represent this chapter, as so many do, as treating of the outward state
        of the Jews, or to deny, with others, that the spiritual and everlasting
        condition of Jacob and Esau are here referred to! If the eternal
        condition of Abraham and of Judas be determined in the Scriptures, so
        also is that of Jacob and Esau; and no meaning, which, from whatever
        motive, any man may affix to the whole tenor of Scripture respecting
        them, will alter their condition. It is better to submit to the word of
        God on this and every other subject, taking it in its obvious import,
        than to be deterred from doing so on account of consequences from the
        admission of which we may shrink back. All Scripture will thus be
        profitable to us for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
        instruction in righteousness, while we are sure that the Judge of all
        the earth will do right.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the whole, we see with what propriety the Apostle here introduces the
        different states of Jacob and Esau, the one beloved of God, the other
        hated. Besides elucidating the subject in question respecting God’s
        dealings with the nation of Israel, and of the word which He had spoken
        taking effect, they illustrate by particular examples both sides of the
        important doctrine of God’s sovereignty in the election, and of His
        justice in the reprobation of fallen men. For, by acting in this manner,
        God has clearly shown that He is the Sovereign Master in their calling
        and election, and of their rejection — that He chooses and rejects as
        seems good to Him any of the sinful race of Adam, all of whom are justly
        objects of His displeasure, without regarding natural qualities which
        distinguish them from one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is said of Jacob and Esau in the Old Testament, in the place to
        which Paul refers, is both historical and typical. It relates, in the
        first view, to themselves personally, the elder being made subservient
        to the younger by selling his birthright. In consequence of that act,
        the declaration, The elder shall serve the younger, was verified from
        the time when it took place. All the rights of the firstborn were thus
        transferred to Jacob, and the inheritance of Canaan devolved on him by
        the surrender of his ungodly brother. At length Esau was compelled to
        leave that land, and to yield to Jacob. When the riches of both of them
        were more than that they might dwell together,’ ‘Esau,’ it is said,
        ‘took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of
        his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance
        which he had got in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from
        the face of his brother Jacob, Genesis 36:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever, therefore, might have previously been the opposition of their
        interests, in this the most important act of his life relating to Jacob,
        Esau was finally made subservient to his younger brother. And this
        subserviency, in yielding up the inheritance which naturally belonged to
        him, continued during the remainder of their lives; so that the
        declaration, ‘The elder shall serve the younger,’ was, after various
        struggles between them, personally and literally fulfilled. In the
        second view, as being typical, what is said of them relates, on the one
        hand, to the state of Israel after the flesh, trampling on and
        forfeiting their high privileges, hated of God, and vessels of wrath
        fitted to destruction; and, on the other hand, to the vessels of mercy
        which God had afore prepared unto glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In loving Jacob, God showed him unmerited favor, and acted towards him
        in mercy; and in hating Esau, He showed him no favor who was entitled to
        none, and acted according to justice. Had God acted also in justice
        without mercy towards Jacob, He would have hated both; for both were in
        their origin guilty in Adam, wicked and deserving of hatred. The Apostle
        unveils the reason why this was not the case, when he afterwards says
        that God has mercy on whom He will have mercy. The justice of God in
        hating Esau was made fully manifest in the sequel by his abuse of the
        high privileges in the course of providence bestowed upon him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding all the advantages of instruction and example with
        which, beyond all others of the human race (with the exception of the
        rest of his family), he was distinguished, Esau despised his birthright,
        fraught with so many blessings, the natural right to which had been
        conferred on him in preference to his brother Jacob, and lived an
        ungodly life. If Jacob, who was placed in the same situation proved
        himself to be a godly man, it was entirely owing to the distinguishing
        grace of God. If it be objected, why was not this grace also vouchsafed
        to Esau? it may as well be asked, why are not the whole of mankind
        saved? That this will not be the case, even they who oppose the
        sovereignty of God in the election of grace cannot deny. Besides, will
        they, who affirm that God chooses men to eternal life because He
        foresees that they will do good works, deny that, at least, God foresaw
        the wickedness of Esau’s life? Even on their own principles, then, it
        was just to hate Esau before he was born; and, on the same ground of
        foreseeing his good works, it would have been just to love Jacob. Or
        will they say that this hatred should not have taken place till after
        Esau had acted such a part? This would prove that there is variableness
        with God, and that He does not hate to-day what He will hate to-morrow.
        Where, then, is the necessity for any one, whatever may be his
        sentiments, to resort to the vain attempt to show that, when it is said
        God loved Jacob and hated Esau, it only means that He loved Esau less
        than Jacob? As well may it be affirmed that, when, in the prophecy of
        Amos 5:15, it is said, ‘Hate the evil, and love the good,’ the meaning
        is, that we ought to love evil only in a less degree than good. But the
        truth is, that all opposition to the plain and obvious meaning of this
        passage proceeds from ignorance of, or inattention to, the state of
        death and ruin in which all men by nature lie, and from which no man can
        be recovered by any outward means alone, however powerful in themselves.
        This cannot be effected by anything short of the unmerited and
        invincibly efficacious grace of God, operating in the heart of those on
        whom He will have mercy according to His sovereign good pleasure.
        Undoubtedly God was under no more obligation to save any of the human
        race than He was to save the fallen angels. If He save any man, it is
        because He hath mercy on whom He will have mercy, or as seemeth good to
        Him. According to those who oppose this manner of acting, God was under
        an obligation to send His Son into the world to save sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the 7th to the end of this 13th verse, we have an incontestable
        proof of the typical nature of the historical facts of the Old
        Testament, by which God was pleased to exhibit a picture or
        representation of spiritual things, and of His dealings respecting the
        people of Israel, as well as what related to His Church in the future
        economy. This typical import is fully recognized in various places in
        the New Testament, showing, as the Apostle declares in the 15th chapter
        of this Epistle, that ‘whatsoever things were written aforetime, were
        written for our learning,’ and also when he speaks of what took place
        respecting Israel in their journey from Egypt, which is equally
        applicable to so many other events. ‘Now all these things happened to
        them for examples,’ literally, types, 1 Corinthians 10:6-11. This proves
        that these occurrences were expressly ordained by Divine wisdom to be ‘a
        shadow of things to come.’ All this, too, we may collect from those
        types and figures of the Old Testament, which would have been wholly
        inconclusive, unless, by a particular destination of the providence of
        God, they had been really instituted to prefigure future events. By many
        it is indeed affirmed that such historical facts as the Apostle in these
        verses refers to, are only accommodated to the allegorical meaning. This
        unfounded allegation, so derogatory to the Holy Scriptures, and utterly
        repugnant to their character as a revelation from God, I have exposed in
        various parts of this work. I have adverted to it more fully, because,
        as formerly observed, it brings a palpable charge of falsehood and
        dishonesty against the inspired writers, representing them as quoting
        the language of the Holy Spirit in a meaning which He did not intend to
        convey, and as confirmatory of their own doctrine, when they knew that
        what they advanced was merely a fanciful accommodation of words.
        Although this degrading opinion is so much countenanced by such writers
        as Tholuck and Stuart, and by many others, I am not aware that it has
        hitherto attracted all that attention, and been marked with that
        abhorrence, which it so justly merits. Nothing is more clear than that
        such historical facts and occurrences as those to which Paul in the
        foregoing passages appeals, were divinely ordered and adapted to
        represent spiritual things; and it is of great importance in the present
        day, when interpreters are so much inclined to overlook the types of the
        Old Testament, to take every proper opportunity of placing them in their
        true lights and pointing out the important purpose which they were
        intended to serve in the future economy, and for which they are referred
        to as in the passages before us. f47
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God?
      </p>
      <p>God forbid.</p>
      <p>
        The Apostle anticipated the objection of the carnal mind to his
        doctrine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does not loving Jacob and hating Esau before they had done any good or
        evil, imply that there is injustice in God? This objection clearly
        proves that the view taken of the preceding passage is correct. For it
        is this view which suggests the objection. Is it just in God to love one
        who has done no good, and to hate one who has done no evil? If the
        assertion respecting loving Jacob and hating Esau admitted of being
        explained away in the manner that so many do, there could be no place
        for such an objection.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what is the Apostle’s reply? Nothing but a decided rejection of the
        supposition that God’s treatment of Jacob and Esau implied injustice. By
        asking the question if there be unrighteousness with God, he strongly
        denies that in God there is here any injustice; and this denial is
        sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the doctrine which he everywhere inculcates, consistently
        with that of the whole of Scripture, God is represented as infinitely
        just, as well as wise, holy, good, and faithful. In the exercise of His
        sovereignty, therefore, all that God wills to do must be in strict
        conformity with the perfection of His character. He cannot deny Himself;
        He cannot act inconsistently with any of His Divine attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
        mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the ground on which the Apostle here rests his denial that there
        is unrighteousness with God? He makes no defense or apology for God,
        attempts no metaphysical distinctions, but rests solely on the authority
        of Scripture. He produces the testimony of God to Moses, declaring the
        same truth that he himself affirms. This is quite enough for Christians.
        It is not wise in them, as is often the case, to adopt a mode of
        vindicating God’s procedure, so very different from what He Himself
        employs. How many go about to justify God, and thereby bring God to the
        bar of man!
      </p>
      <p>
        From the defenses of Scripture doctrine, often resorted to, it might be
        supposed that God was on His trial before men, rather than that all
        shall stand before Him, and that the will of God is supreme justice. I
        will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on
        whom I will have compassion. — That is, I will have mercy on whom I
        please — I will bestow My favors, or withhold them, as seemeth to Me
        good. God by this declaration proves that He is a debtor to none; that
        every blessing bestowed upon the elect flows from gratuitous love, and
        is freely granted to whom He pleases. The answer, then, of the Apostle
        amounts to this that what is recorded concerning God’s loving Jacob and
        hating Esau is in nothing different from His usual mode of procedure
        towards men, but is entirely consistent with the whole plan of His
        government. All men are lost and guilty in Adam; it is of mercy that any
        are saved; and God declares that He will have mercy or not upon men
        according to His own good pleasure. It is only of this attribute that
        such language as is contained in this passage can be employed. The
        exercise of every other attribute is at all times indispensable, and
        never can be suspended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
        runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the conclusion from the whole. Salvation is not from the will of
        man, nor from his efforts in striving for it, but is entirely of God’s
        mercy vouchsafed to whom He pleases. What foundation, then, can be
        discovered in the word of God for those schemes of self-righteousness,
        which, in a greater or less degree, make salvation depend on man’s own
        exertions?
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be here an allusion to Jacob’s desiring the blessing of the
        birthright, and his running to provide the venison by which he deceived
        his father; but his obtaining the blessing was solely the consequence of
        God’s good pleasure, for the means he employed for the purpose merited
        punishment rather than success. In like manner, the salvation of any man
        is not to be ascribed to his own good will and diligent endeavors to
        arrive at it, but solely to the purpose of God according to election,
        which is ‘not of works, but of Him that calleth.’ It is true, indeed,
        that believers both will and run, but this is the effect, not the cause,
        of the grace of God being vouchsafed to them. ‘Work out your own
        salvation with fear and trembling.’ To whom is this addressed? To ‘the
        saints in Christ Jesus,’ in whom God had begun a good work, which He
        will perform until the day of Jesus Christ — to them who had always
        obeyed, Philippians 1:1,6,29, 2:12. But besides this, what is the motive
        or encouragement to work out their salvation? ‘For it is God which
        worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.’ Here all
        the willing and doing of men in the service of God is ascribed to His
        operation in causing them to will and to do. The whole of the new
        covenant is a promise of God that He Himself will act efficaciously for
        the salvation of those whom He will save. ‘I will put my law in their
        inward parts, and write it in their hearts.’ ‘I will give them one
        heart, and one way, that they may fear Me for ever.’ ‘I will put My fear
        in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.’ ‘A new heart also
        will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take
        away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of
        flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My
        statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them,’ Jeremiah 31,32;
        Ezekiel 36: In this way the means by which God’s elect are brought to
        Him, their calling, their justification, their sanctification, their
        perseverance, and their glorification, are all of God, as was shown in
        the preceding chapter, and not of themselves. ‘There is great folly,’
        say Calvin, ‘in the argument that we are possessed of a certain energy
        in our zeal, but of such a kind as can effect nothing of itself, unless
        aided by the mercy of Jehovah, since the Apostle shows that we possess
        nothing of our own, by excluding all our efforts. To infer that we have
        the power either of running or willing, is a mere cavil, which Paul
        denies, and plainly asserts that our will or ardor in the race has not
        the smallest influence in procuring our election. On the ether hand,
        those merit the severest reproof who continue to indulge in sloth, that
        they may afford room and opportunity for the grace of God to act; since,
        although their own industry can accomplish nothing, yet the heavenly
        zeal inspired by the Father of Lights is endued with active efficacy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        If any shall oppose the declaration of the Apostle, that it is not of
        him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,
        and assert that the salvation of man depends on conditions which he is
        obliged to fulfill, then it may be asked, what is the condition? Is it
        faith? Faith is the gift of God. Is it repentance? Christ is exalted a
        Prince and a Savior to give repentance. Is it love? God promises to
        circumcise the heart in order to love Him. Are they good works? His
        people are the workmanship of God created unto good works. Is it
        perseverance to the end? They are kept by the power of God through faith
        unto salvation. It is true that all these things are commanded and
        enforced by the most powerful motives, consequently they are duties
        which require the exercise of our faculties.
      </p>
      <p>
        But they are assured by the decree of election, and are granted to the
        elect of God in the proper season; so that, in this view, they are the
        objects of promise, and the effects of supernatural and Divine
        influence. ‘Thy people,’ saith Jehovah to the Messiah, ‘shall be willing
        in the day of Thy power.’ Thus the believer, in running his race, and
        working out his salvation, is actuated by God, and animated by the
        consideration of His all-powerful operation in the beginning of his
        course; of the continuation of His support during its progress; and by
        the assurance that it shall be effectual in enabling him to overcome all
        obstacles, and to arrive in safety at its termination.

        Ver. 17. — For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same
        purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show My power in thee, and
        that My name might be declared throughout all the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse stands connected, not with the 15th and 16th, which
        immediately precede it, but with the 13th and 14th. In the 13th verse,
        God’s love to Jacob and His hatred to Esau are declared. In respect to
        both, it is demanded in the 14th verse, if there be injustice with God.
        In the 15th and 16th verses following, the answer is given regarding the
        preference and love of God to Jacob. In this 17th verse, the Apostle
        replies to the question as it refers to God’s hatred of Esau. And the
        answer here is precisely similar to that given respecting Jacob. God’s
        love to Jacob before he had done any good was according to His usual
        plan of procedure; and on the same ground, His hatred of Esau before he
        had done any evil is also vindicated. Paul here proves his doctrine from
        the example of one to whom, in Divine sovereignty, God acted according
        to justice without mercy. The Scripture saith that God raised up Pharaoh
        for the very purpose of manifesting His own glory in his punishment. For
        the Scripture saith. — By the manner in which the Apostle begins this
        verse, we are taught that whatever the Scriptures declare on any subject
        is to be considered as decisive on the point. ‘What saith the
        Scripture?’ This is the proof to which the Apostle appeals. It should
        further be observed, that Paul ascribes to the Scriptures what was said
        by God Himself, Exodus 9:16. This expressly teaches us that the words of
        Scripture are the words of God. In the same manner, in the Epistle to
        the Galatians, it is said, the Scripture, ‘foreseeing that God would
        justify the heathen;’ and, ‘the scripture hath concluded all under sin,’
        Galatians 3:8,22. Here the word of God is so much identified with
        Himself, that the Scripture is represented as possessing and exercising
        the peculiar prerogatives of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is done by God, and what belongs only to Him, is ascribed to the
        Scriptures, — proving that they contain the very words of God. ‘All
        Scripture is given by inspiration of God, 2 Timothy 3:16. The word
        Scripture is here taken in its appropriated meaning — being confined to
        the book of God. All that is written in it is divinely inspired; and
        what does writing consist of but of words? If any of these are not
        inspired, then all Scripture is not inspired. Every word, then, in the
        book referred to, is the word of God, dictated by Him of whom the
        writers were the instruments He employed, who spoke or wrote as they
        were moved by the Holy Ghost. Why are so many unwilling to admit this
        view of the inspiration of Scripture so much insisted on in the
        Scriptures themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it on account of the difficulty of conceiving how words should thus
        be communicated? But is it easier to understand how ideas could be
        communicated? Do they believe that the Lord ‘opened the mouth of the
        ass’ of Balaam, and communicated the words which she spake? Is it then
        more difficult to communicate words to men than to a dumb animal? To
        speak of difficulties where Omnipotence is concerned, is palpably
        absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, all allow that in the parts of Scripture to which (making vain
        distinctions respecting inspiration, without the least foundation from
        any expression the Scriptures contain) they ascribe the inspiration of
        ‘suggestion,’ the very words were communicated to the writers. Those who
        deny the plenary verbal inspiration of the Scriptures, — who introduce
        various modifications of the manner in which they have been written, —
        neither can nor ought to entertain the same profound veneration for them
        as those who believe that, without any exception, from beginning to end,
        they are dictated by God Himself. The Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, —
        that is, the Scripture showeth how Moses was commanded to say unto
        Pharaoh, Exodus 9:16, — Even for this same purpose have I raised thee
        up. — Here is the destination of Pharaoh to his destruction. That I
        might show My power in thee, and that My name might be declared
        throughout all the earth. — This is the end and design intended by it.
        It was not, then, by any concurrence of fortuitous circumstances that
        Pharaoh was seated on the throne of Egypt, and invested with the power
        he possessed when Moses was appointed to conduct Israel out of Egypt. He
        was raised up, or made to stand in that place, in order that, by his
        opposition, from the perversity of his heart, in him God might show His
        own power and exalt His own name. It is not merely alleged that God had
        not shown mercy to this king of Egypt, or that He had suffered him to go
        on in his wicked ways; but, in language which the unrenewed heart of man
        will never relish, it is declared, ‘Even for this same purpose have I
        raised thee up, that I might show My power in thee, and that My name
        might be declared throughout all the earth.’ For this very end, the
        birth, the life, and the situation of Pharaoh were all of Divine
        appointment. This is language so clear that it cannot be guiltlessly
        misinterpreted. The unbelieving heart of man will revolt, and his
        ingenuity may invent expedients to soften this explicit declaration; but
        it never can be successfully evaded. All the shifts of sophistry will
        never be able fairly, or even plausibly, to explain this language in a
        sense that will not testify the sovereignty of God.

        The above truth respecting Pharaoh is what the Scriptures declare; and
        we ought never to pretend to go further into the deep things of God than
        they go before us, but submissively to bow to every Divine declaration.
        We know that all sin will be found with man; but here we are taught that
        even the sin of man will turn out for the glory of God, and for this
        very purpose the wicked are raised up. If we cannot fathom this depth in
        the Divine counsels, still let us be certain that what God says is true,
        and must be received by us. We are assured that the Judge of all the
        earth will in all things act righteously, although we may not be able to
        comprehend His ways. Nor are we required to comprehend them. We are
        required to believe His word, and to believe that it is consistent with
        the eternal righteousness of His character. ‘Let us treasure,’ says
        Calvin, ‘the following observation in our minds, — never to feel the
        least desire to attain any other knowledge concerning this doctrine save
        what is taught us in Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Lord shuts His sacred mouth, let us also stop our thoughts from
        advancing one step further in our inquiries.’ Consistently with the vain
        attempts that have been made to reconcile the truth above affirmed with
        philosophy falsely so called, the whole subject of this chapter might be
        rejected, equally with that of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures.
        It has accordingly been perverted by many who have explained it in such
        a way as to remove all the difficulties which it presents. Our Lord in
        one short sentence has declared the true reason of their finding it so
        hard to understand this chapter. ‘Why do ye not understand My speech? —
        even because ye cannot hear My word.’ It is also written for our
        warning. ‘Many, therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard this,
        said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?’ There is no part of
        Scripture, the meaning of which is more obvious than that of this
        chapter. But if men will yield to the natural opposition of their minds
        to the truth it declares, and, wresting the plainest expressions, affirm
        that hatred signifies love, is it surprising that they are bewildered in
        following their own devices? f49 Ver. 18. — Therefore hath He mercy on
        whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the general conclusion is drawn from all the Apostle had said in
        the three preceding verses, in denying that God was unrighteous in
        loving Jacob and hating Esau. It exhibits the ground of God’s dealings
        both with the elect and the reprobate. It concludes that His own
        sovereign pleasure is the rule both with respect to those whom He
        receives, and those whom He rejects. He pardons one and hardens another,
        without reference to anything but His own sovereign will, in accordance
        with His infinite wisdom, holiness, and justice. ‘Even so, Father,’ said
        our blessed Lord, ‘for so it seemed good in Thy sight.’ God is not
        chargeable with any injustice in electing some and not others; for this
        is an act of mere mercy and compassion, and that can be no violation of
        justice. Therefore hath He mercy On whom He will have mercy. — Paul here
        repeats for the third time, that God has mercy on whom He will have
        mercy, without intimating the least regard to anything in man as
        deserving mercy. The smallest degree of right in the creature would
        furnish reason for displaying justice, not mercy. Mercy is that adorable
        perfection of God by which He pities and relieves the miserable. Under
        the good and righteous government of God, no one is miserable who does
        not deserve to be so. The objects of mercy are persons who are
        miserable, because they are guilty, and therefore justly deserving of
        punishment. The exercise of mercy is a particular display of the grace
        or free favor of God. In no case can it be due to a guilty creature; it
        necessarily implies the absence of all right. A man can never have a
        right to mercy; and to talk of deserving mercy is a contradiction in
        terms. God, it is said, ‘delighteth in mercy,’ Micah 7:18; and in the
        proclamation of His name to Moses, this attribute is particularly
        signalized. ‘The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,’ Exodus
        34:6. He is ‘rich’ and ‘plenteous’ in mercy, and ‘His tender mercies are
        over all His works.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercy, however, is an attribute, the constant exercise of which is not
        essential to God, like that of justice, which can never, as has been
        remarked, for a moment be suspended. Mercy is dispensed according to His
        sovereign pleasure in regard to persons or times, as to Him seemeth
        good. Towards the fallen children of men it was gloriously displayed
        when God sent His Son into the world, which was purely a work of mercy,
        and not demanded by justice. But to the fallen angels mercy was not
        vouchsafed. And is this any impeachment of the mercy of God? If not, is
        it a just ground for complaint, that in order to manifest His hatred of
        sin, His mercy is not extended to a certain portion of the human race,
        who we know for certain shall perish? Thus God has mercy on whom He will
        have mercy. It is one of the fundamental errors of Socinians, and of
        many besides, to hold that the mercy of God must be necessarily and
        constantly exercised; while, reversing the order of Scripture, and all
        its representations of the character of God, they deny this necessity
        regarding His justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same act, however, may be both an act of justice and an act of mercy
        in reference to different objects. The punishment of the enemies of God,
        the slaying of the firstborn in Egypt, the overthrow of Pharaoh and his
        host, the discomfiture of kings, and the transfer of their lands for an
        heritage to Israel, while they were acts of justice towards the enemies
        of His people, are all ascribed to the mercy of God to them, <19D601>
        Psalm ‘To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for His mercy
        endureth for ever: But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea:
        for His mercy endureth for ever: To Him which smote great kings: for His
        mercy endureth for ever: And slew famous kings: for His mercy endureth
        for ever: And gave their land for an heritage: for His mercy endureth
        for ever:
      </p>
      <p>
        Even an heritage to Israel His servant: for His mercy endureth for
        ever.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercy, then, which is a particular kind of Divine goodness, is
        sovereign; and to confer favors freely, consistently with Divine wisdom,
        does injury to no one. If God was only just, there would be no place for
        mercy; if He never acted as a sovereign benefactor, there could be no
        place for the plan of redemption. God may be considered under two
        different aspects, either as judging with equity, or as disposing at His
        will of His benefits; in other words, as a judge, or as a sovereign.
        Under either of these aspects, in whatever manner He acts, having
        nothing higher than Himself, He is the supreme God. Sovereignty, when
        this word is applied to God, signifies the arbitrary will of a
        benefactor, because that under the other aspects there is no place for
        the exercise of arbitrary will. In the exercise of His justice, God is
        sovereign in His judgments and His punishments, but not arbitrary,
        because He does not judge without demerit in the objects of His
        judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        When, therefore, He acts as Judge and Supreme Ruler, His acts are
        founded upon equity; but when He acts as Sovereign, His acts are founded
        upon His free favor, and dispensed with wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever offense the human mind may take at the attribute of Divine
        justice, and its exercise in punishing the guilty, we should think that
        all men would eagerly embrace the view given in Scripture of the Divine
        mercy. Yet, in reality, the peculiar character of the mercy of God is as
        disagreeable to men as is His justice itself. The Divine mercy is not
        only sovereign, but, respecting its object, it is unlimited. Neither of
        these peculiarities is agreeable to the mind of man. Human wisdom views
        God as merciful, but that mercy it makes to extend equally to all, and
        unlimitedly to none. For persons not guilty of glaring sins, God’s mercy
        is not only expected by the world, but even claimed and demanded. To
        deny it to those who are sober and regular in their lives, would be
        looked on as both cruel and unjust. In the passage before us, however,
        we see that God’s mercy is sovereign, that it extends to one and not to
        another, while no man can give a reason for the preference of one and
        the rejection of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only reason God condescends to give is His own pleasure: ‘I will
        have mercy on whom I will have mercy.’ The unlimited character of the
        Divine mercy is a thing that ought to be most agreeable to every man.
        Even should any be so blind as not to perceive that they need such mercy
        for themselves, yet, if they loved mankind, they should rejoice that the
        Divine mercy is such as to extend to the chief of sinners. Constant
        experience, however, as well as the history of our Lord’s life, shows us
        that this is not the case. Instead of rejoicing in the extent of the
        Divine mercy, the heart of the self-righteous man will swell with
        indignation when he hears that mercy is extended to the vile and the
        profligate. Nothing in the conduct of our Lord gave such offense to the
        scribes and Pharisees as this peculiarity in His conduct of receiving
        sinners In the most prominent manner He exhibited this feature of mercy,
        and publicans and sinners heard Him, and received His doctrine, and
        turned from their sins unto God; while the proud, self-righteous
        Pharisees burned with indignation at the conduct of Christ in this
        instance. He was constantly upbraided as receiving sinners and eating
        with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the mercy of God, Dr. Thomson observes, ‘It cannot be that His mercy
        should be exerted at the expense or to the disparagement, in any the
        least degree, of one excellence which beautifies His nature, or upholds
        His government, or speaks His praise. His mercy is sovereign and
        gratuitous; and therefore it can only be displayed when every other
        quality that belongs to Him is fully maintained, and there is no
        sacrifice of the honor that is due to each, and of the consistency which
        pervades the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever His mercy cannot be exercised without refusing the demands of
        His justice, or without bringing into question the immutability of His
        faithfulness, or without denying the irresistible energy of His power,
        or without impeaching the infallibility of His wisdom, or without
        throwing suspicion on the absolute purity of His nature — in these cases
        His mercy cannot be exercised at all, for the exercise of it would
        involve some shortcoming in His perfection, which is necessarily
        unqualified and unlimited. It is only of this attribute that it can be
        said, ‘He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy.’ Of every other
        attribute it is requisite that we predicate positive and peremptory
        operation. He must be holy; He must be wise; He must be powerful; He
        must be just; He must be true; He must be each and all of these,
        whatever betide His universe; and if we, His apostate creatures, cannot
        be the objects of His mercy except by some surrender of the homage due
        to them, or some violation of the harmony that reigns among them, His
        mercy cannot save, and cannot reach us.’ And whom He will He hardeneth.
        — If God hath mercy on whom He will, He hardeneth whom He will. In
        hardening men, God does no injustice, nor does He act in any degree
        contrary to the perfection of His character. He does not communicate
        hardness or perversity to the hearts of men by any positive internal
        act, as when He communicates His grace. ‘Let no man say when he is
        tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil,
        neither tempteth He any man.’ Wicked men are not restrained by the holy
        influences of grace, but by the different restraints under which they
        are placed by Providence. They are hardened when these restraints are
        removed, and when they are left free to act according to the depraved
        inclinations of their own hearts, to which the Lord gives them up, Psalm
        81:12; Acts 7:42; Romans 1:24,26,28. Or they are hardened by the
        communication of qualities which are neither good nor bad in themselves,
        but which may become either good or bad according to the use made of
        them, such as courage, perseverance, or other dispositions which may be
        employed for bad purposes. Men are also hardened when they are abandoned
        to the suggestions of Satan, of whom they are the willing slaves. Thus
        Judas was hardened by Satan, who had taken possession of him, and to
        whom he submitted himself, although most solemnly warned of his danger.
        When a man is entirely left to himself, the commands, the warnings, the
        judgments, the deliverances, and all the truths of Scripture become
        causes of hardness, of insensibility, of pride, and presumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the delay of merited punishment, and the deliverances from the
        plagues that fell on his country, were, in respect to Pharaoh, the
        occasion of hardening his heart. ‘Because sentence against an evil work
        is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is
        fully set in them to do evil’ In these ways men’s hearts are hardened,
        through means that in themselves are calculated to produce the opposite
        effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        But by whatever means the heart of men is hardened, they are regulated
        by God, who also determines that they shall succeed. We see this
        remarkably verified in the case of Ahab. ‘And the Lord said, Thou shalt
        entice him, and thou shalt also prevail. Go out and do even so. Now,
        therefore, behold the Lord hath put a Lying spirit in the mouth of these
        thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee,’ 2 Chronicles
        18:21. ‘If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
        Lord have deceived that prophet; and I will stretch out My hand upon
        him, and will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel,’ Ezekiel
        14:9. ‘Truly the Son of Man goeth, as it was determined; but woe unto
        that man by whom Me is betrayed,’ Luke 22:22. ‘Him, being delivered by
        the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by
        wicked hands have crucified and slain,’ Acts 2:23. ‘Of a truth against
        Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius
        Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered
        together, for to do whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined
        before to be done,’ Acts 4:27. ‘A stone of stumbling, and a rock of
        offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient;
        whereunto also they were appointed,’ 1 Peter 2:8. This shows an
        ordination of God to the thing referred to, which thing was sinful.
        ‘There are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
        ordained to this condemnation.’ The persons here spoken of are said to
        be ordained to condemnation, which, whatever it may be supposed to be,
        implies pre-appointment to it by God, Jude 4. ‘Therefore, they could not
        believe, because Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and
        hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor
        understand with their heart, and I should heal them,’ John 12:39.
        ‘According as it is written, God hath given them a spirit of slumber,
        eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto
        this day,’ Romans 11:8. ‘And for this cause God shall send them strong
        delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned
        who believe not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,’ 2
        Thessalonians 2:11. It is nothing to the purpose to allege that this was
        in judgment for not receiving the love of the truth; whatever was the
        cause, God sent them strong delusion, so that they should believe a lie.
        In the same way it is said, Revelation 17:17, ‘God hath put in their
        hearts to fulfill His will, and to agree and give their kingdom to the
        beast.’ ‘Babylon,’ says Dr. Carson, in his History of Providence, ‘ was
        employed by Providence for the chastisement of His people, and
        commissioned to carry the Jews into captivity. Babylon was guilty in
        executing the will of the Lord, and was providentially destroyed by Him
        with an unexampled destruction. The Medes and Persians are sent by God
        to execute His vengeance on Babylon. He calls out their hosts and gives
        them victory, yet the Medes and Persians were excited by their own
        passions. Besides, says God, I will bring up the Medes against them,
        which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight
        in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have
        no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.
        How awful does Providence appear here! Even when savage idolaters
        violate every dictate of humanity, they are the executors of the
        judgments of the Almighty. While their conduct is most horridly guilty,
        in the Divine sovereignty it fulfills God’s will. Who can fathom this
        depth? In God’s dealings with Assyria and Babylon we ought to find a key
        to His providence in His dealings with the western nations of Europe.
        Does not Jehovah govern the world? Is there evil in the city, and the
        Lord hath not done it?’
      </p>
      <p>
        In all the above acts relating to men, God proceeds in conformity to His
        justice. He is infinitely just in hating, hardening, and condemning
        sinners, in adjudging them to punishment for their wickedness, and in
        placing them in situations in which, in the free exercise of their evil
        dispositions, they will do what the Lord has appointed for His own
        glory. Thus God orders events in such a manner, that, as in the passages
        above quoted, the sin will, through the wickedness of men: certainly be
        committed, while He is not the author of evil, but, on the contrary, of
        good. He displays His holiness in the events and in their consequences.
        Men may employ all their art in wresting the above and similar passages,
        but they are recorded in the Scriptures, which are the word of God, and
        which cannot be broken. ‘The Lord hath made all things for Himself; yea,
        even the wicked for the day of evil,’ Proverbs 16:4. ‘Why dost thou
        strive against Him? for He giveth not account of His matters,’ — or
        answereth not, Job 33:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        That God does not harden any man in such a way as to be the author of
        sin, is most certain. But there must be a sense in which He hardens
        sinners, or the thing would not be asserted. From His conduct with
        respect to Pharaoh, it is obvious that sinners are hardened by the
        providence of God bringing them into situations that manifest and excite
        their corruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the history of Pharaoh in the Book of Exodus, it is repeated ten
        times, that God hardened Pharaoh’s heart. Pharaoh is also said to have
        hardened his own heart. This shows that there is a certain connection
        between God’s hardening the hearts of men and their voluntarily
        hardening their own hearts, so that when the one takes place the other
        does so likewise. It does not follow from this that God’s hardening the
        heart of Pharaoh, and Pharaoh’s hardening his own heart, are one and the
        same thing. This supposition, although adopted by many is contrary to
        the representations and the express words of Scripture. The just
        inference is, that there is one view in which Pharaoh hardened his
        heart, and another in which God is said to have hardened it. We should
        believe both; but to attempt to show the philosophy of their
        reconciliation, is to attempt to fathom infinity. In <19A525> Psalm
        105:25, it is said with respect to the people of Egypt, that God ‘turned
        their heart to hate His people.’ Can anything be stronger or more clear
        than this passage? No doubt it was their own sin, but there is also a
        sense in which the thing was of God. Are we to deny this because we
        cannot explain the way in which God did this? On the same ground we
        might reject the doctrine of the Trinity, or any other of the
        incomprehensible doctrines of Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this subject, Dr. Carson, in his book lately published, entitled,
        Examination of the Principles of Biblical Interpretation of Ernesti,
        Ammon, Stuart, and other Philologists, observes, ‘It is said that God
        hardened the heart of Pharaoh; it is said also that Pharaoh hardened his
        own heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        What, then, is the lawful way to reconcile these two statements? The
        statements must both be true. There must be a sense in which God
        hardened Pharaoh’s heart, for this is as expressly asserted as that
        Pharaoh hardened his own heart. That this is not a sense implying that
        God is the author of Pharaoh’s sin, there cannot be a moment’s question.
        I may be asked how God could in any sense harden a man’s heart without
        being the author of sin a But the most assured belief of the fact does
        not require that an answer should be given to the question. A thing may
        be true, yet utterly inexplicable. God’s declaration is perfectly
        sufficient for the belief of anything which He testifies. Our reception
        of it does not imply that we know the grounds or nature of its truth. We
        receive it, not because we can explain how it is true, but because we
        know that God cannot lie. The Scriptures testify the fact; the fact,
        then, must be received as truth. The Scriptures do not testify the
        manner in which the thing is true of God; the manner, then, is not a
        thing to be believed, and consequently not a thing to be explained by
        man.... Many tell us that such assertions mean merely that God permits
        the thing which He is said to do. But is permission sufficient to secure
        accomplishment? God sent Joseph to Egypt; that is, it is said, He
        permitted his brethren to sell him. Nay, but it was God’s will, purpose,
        and plan, that Joseph should go down to Egypt, and His providence
        secured the event. “Now, therefore,” says Joseph, “be not grieved nor
        angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither! for God did send me
        before you to preserve life.” His brethren did it wickedly; God did it
        in mercy and in wisdom. We know that he did it entirely in consistency
        with man’s accountability; but the manner of this consistency is not a
        matter of revelation, and therefore it is impossible to attempt
        explanation. “ Romans 9:18,” says Ammon, “appears to be an obscure
        passage relating to the absolute decrees of God. Light may be thrown
        upon this by 1 Samuel 6:6, where Pharaoh is said to have hardened his
        own heart.”

        How does 1 Samuel 6:6 throw light upon Romans 9:18? We might have
        expected rather that Ammon would have found a contradiction, as the one
        passage ascribes to God what the other ascribes to man. The passages
        indeed are consistent; but their consistency must be made out, not by
        obliging one of them to silence the other, but by the principle that
        they assert the same thing in a different view. Ammon’s plan, I presume,
        is to make Romans 9:18 recant, in order to harmonize with 1 Samuel 6:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the honor of Scripture, and of God’s character, require that they
        should be reconciled in a way that renders both true.’

        Calvin, in his commentary on Exodus, represents those as perverting the
        Scriptures who insist that no more is meant than a bare permission when
        God is said to harden the hearts of men. He speaks of such as frigid
        speculatores, diluti moderatores, to whose delicate ears such Scripture
        expressions seem harsh and offensive. They therefore, he observes,
        ‘soften them down by turning an action into a permission, as if there
        were no difference between acting and suffering, i.e., suffering others
        to act.’ Such, he says, who will admit of permission only, suspend this
        counsel and determination of God, wholly on the will of man; but that he
        is not ashamed or afraid to speak as the Holy Spirit does, and does not
        hesitate to approve and embrace what the Scriptures so often declares,
        viz., that God blinds the minds of wicked men, and hardens their hearts.
        In his commentary on the passage before us, Romans 9:18, to the same
        purpose he observes, ‘The word hardening, when attributed to God in
        Scripture, not only means permission (as some trifling theologians
        determine), but the action of Divine wrath; for all external
        circumstances, which contribute to blind the reprobates, are instruments
        of the Divine indignation. Satan also himself, the internal efficacious
        agent, is so completely the servant of the Most High, as to act only by
        His command.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frivolous attempt of the school men to avoid the difficulty by
        foreknowledge, is completely subverted; for Paul does not say that the
        ruin of the wicked is foreseen by the Lord, but ordained by His counsel,
        decree, and will. Solomon also teaches that the destruction of the
        wicked was not only foreknown, but they were made on purpose for the day
        of evil’ ( Proverbs 16:4). f51 Some profess Calvinism, but affect to
        hold it in a more unexceptionable manner than it is held in the system
        in general. They seem to think that in the defense of that system,
        Calvin was extravagant, and that he gave unnecessary offense by
        exaggerated statements, and by language not warranted by the Scriptures.
        Such persons, it is presumed, are strangers to the writings of Calvin.
        Calvin himself is remarkable for keeping on Scripture ground, and
        avoiding anything that may justly be termed extravagant. No writer has
        ever indulged less in metaphysical speculation on the deep things of God
        than this writer. To support his system, it was necessary only to
        exhibit Scripture testimony, and he seems quite contented to rest the
        matter on this foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is called moderate Calvinism is in reality refined Arminianism. It
        is impossible to modify the former without sliding into the latter. If
        the doctrine of God’s sovereignty and of unconditional election be
        denied, regeneration and redemption must undergo a corresponding
        modification, and all the doctrines of grace will be more or less
        affected. While it is admitted that many of the people of God, through
        imperfect views of Divine truth, falter on the subject of election, it
        is a truth essential to the plan of salvation, and a truth most
        explicitly revealed. No truth in the Scriptures is more easily defended.
        The reason why many find it difficult to defend this doctrine is, that
        they suppose it necessary to account for it by human wisdom, and to
        justify the conduct of God. We have nothing to do with the grounds of
        the Divine procedure, we have to do only with the Divine testimony, that
        testimony which Mr. Tholuck so fearfully perverts. There are many who in
        words fully admit the doctrine of predestination, and at the same time
        neutralize it by dwelling exclusively upon God’s being love, and laying
        the blame of the whole world not being saved on the sloth of
        Christians.] That ordination, with respect to evil, is merely
        permission, is an opinion which cannot be maintained. Permission is not
        ordination in any sense of the term, and ordination is quite a different
        idea from permission. We may permit what we do not ordain, and when we
        ordain anything, we do more than permit it. But it will be replied, Does
        not this make God the author of sin? It is answered, that the sense in
        which God ordains sin is above our comprehension. It must be a sense in
        which He is not the author of sin — a sense, too, in which
        responsibility entirely rests with man. But the way in which this is
        true, we cannot explain. It is enough to know that God hath declared it.
        We are to believe Him on His own testimony, and to honor Him by
        submitting to whatever He declares. God tells us that He doth such
        things, He tells us also that men do these things. We should believe
        both assertions, though we cannot reconcile them. Does not God say in
        His word — ’As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways
        higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts?’ Does He not
        say that His ways are past finding out? If we could fathom all the ways
        of God, the Scriptures could not be His word. What God reveals, let us
        know: what He conceals, let us not attempt to discover. God is from
        eternity; but we are of yesterday and know nothing.

        God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, as He declared from the beginning of the
        history He would do; but did not put evil into his mind. There was no
        need for this, for he was previously wicked like all mankind. God has no
        occasion to put evil into the heart of any, in order to their
        destruction, for in consequence of the curse of the broken law (from
        which God’s people alone are delivered), there is in no natural man
        anything good towards God, Romans 8:7. While He thus punished Pharaoh’s
        wickedness no more than his iniquity deserved, God, in doing so,
        displayed to His people Israel their security under His protection.
      </p>

        Ver. 19. — Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth He yet find fault? For
        who hath resisted His will?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the Apostle obviates a third objection or cavil. The first was,
        that God is unfaithful, verse 6. The second, that God is unjust, verse
        14. This third is, that God is severe and cruel. If God thus shows
        mercy, or hardens according to His sovereign pleasure, why, then, it may
        be asked, does He yet find fault with transgressors? This is the only
        objection that can be made to what the Apostle was stating. Thou wilt
        say, then, who hath resisted His will? If God wills sin, and if He is
        all-powerful, must He not be the author of sin? Mr. Fry here remarks, —
        ’The thought will frequently start in the mind of the inquirer: If
        Divine grace is bestowed on some, and withheld from others; especially
        if the sins and transgressions of men are so under the control of the
        Almighty, that they but serve His purposes, how is it that such blame
        and censure attaches to the sinner, and that such dreadful judgments are
        denounced against him? If our unrighteousness commend the righteousness
        of God, what shall we say then, is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?
        This, it will be perceived, is no other than the difficulty so generally
        felt in attempting to reconcile the responsibility of man as a moral
        agent, with a pre-ordination of all events, after the determinate
        counsel and foreknowledge of God. This pre-ordination the Apostle had
        asserted and proved from the Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Scriptures, at the same time, is evinced the complete
        responsibility of man as a moral agent: God’s finding fault; His
        remonstrances with transgressors; the declaration of their amenableness
        to a just judgment the manner in which the Gospel addresses them, and
        bewails their hardness and their impenetrable heart, unquestionably
        establishes this point. The proud wisdom of rebellious man indeed,
        almost dares to charge the oracles of God with inconsistency on this
        head; or, what is nearly as bad, takes upon itself either to explain
        away or to invalidate one part of the Scripture truth in order to
        establish the other, and, in apologizing for Him before His creatures,
        to make God consistent with Himself! Such is the wicked presumption of
        man; such, we may lament to add, is the officious folly of some who mean
        to be the advocates of revelation; and the weak and imprudent defense of
        a friend is as dishonorable often as the open accusation of an enemy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The objection stated in the verse before us is in substance the same as
        is urged to this day, and it never can be put more strongly than here by
        the Apostle. What, then, does he answer? This we learn in the subsequent
        verses, in which he charges upon those who prefer it, their great
        impiety in presuming to arraign the ways of God, and to take up an
        argument against their Maker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall
        the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
      </p>
      <p>
        To the preceding objection, the Apostle, in this and the two following
        verses, gives three distinct answers. His first answer in this verse,
        similar to Isaiah 45:9, is directed against the proud reasonings of man
        who, though he be born like a wild ass’s colt, and being of yesterday,
        knows nothing, Job 11:12, presumes to scan the deep things of God, and
        to find fault with the plan of His government and providence, into which
        angels desire to look, while they find it incomprehensible. We are here
        taught that it is perfectly sufficient to silence all objections, to
        prove that anything is the will of God. No man, after this is done, has
        a right to hesitate or to doubt. The rectitude of God’s will is not to
        be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        What men have to do is to learn what God says, and then to receive it as
        unquestionably true and right. Nay but, O man, who art thou? — And what
        is man that he should take upon him to object to anything that God says?
        The reason and discernment between right and wrong which he possesses is
        the gift of God; it must, then, be the greatest abuse of these faculties
        to employ them to question the conduct of Him who gave them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question of the Apostle imports that it is a thing most preposterous
        for such a creature as man to question the procedure of God. Shall the
        thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast Thou formed me this? —
        Can anything be more presumptuous than for the creature to pretend to
        greater wisdom than the Creator? Any wisdom the creature possesses must
        have been received from the Creator; and if the Creator has the power of
        forming rational beings, must He not Himself be infinite in wisdom? And
        does it not insult the Creator to pretend to find imperfection in His
        proceedings? Why, as Thou art all-powerful, hast Thou formed me in such
        a manner that I am capable of sin and misery?
      </p>
      <p>
        The rebellious heart of man is never satisfied with the Apostle’s
        answer, and still the question is, Why did He make men to be condemned?
        Let the Lord’s people be satisfied with the Apostle’s answer, and let it
        be sufficient for them to know that God has willed both the salvation of
        the elect, and the destruction of the wicked, although they are not able
        to fathom the depths of the ways of God. The Apostle tells us the fact,
        and shows us that it must be received on God’s testimony, and not on our
        ability to justify it. That God does all things right there is no
        question, but the grounds of His conduct He does not now explain to His
        people. Much less is it to be supposed that He would justify His conduct
        by explaining the grounds of it to His enemies. No man has a right to
        bring God to trial.
      </p>
      <p>
        What He tells us of Himself, or of ourselves, let us receive as
        unquestionably right. ‘Paul,’ says Calvin, ‘doth not busily labor to
        excuse God with a lying defense. He would not have neglected refuting
        the objection, that God reprobates or elects, according to His own will,
        those whom He does not honor with His favor, or love gratuitously, had
        he considered it to be false. The impious object, that men are exempted
        from guilt if the will of God has the chief part in the salvation of the
        elect, or destruction of the reprobate. Does Paul deny it? Nay; his
        answer confirms this truth — that God determines to do with mankind what
        He pleases, and that men rise up with unavailing fury to contest it,
        since the Maker of the world assigns to His creatures, by His own right,
        whatever lot He chooses. If we cannot declare a reason why He
        vouchsafeth to grant mercy to them that are His, but because it pleaseth
        Him, neither also shall we have any other cause in rejecting of others
        than His own will; for when it is said that God hardeneth or showeth
        mercy to whom He will, men are thereby savored to seek no cause
        elsewhere than in His own will’ ‘Mere human reason,’ says Luther to
        Erasmus, ‘can never comprehend how God is good and merciful; and
        therefore you make to yourself a God of your own fancy, who hardens
        nobody, condemns nobody, pities everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot comprehend how a just God can condemn those who are born in
        sin, and cannot help themselves, but must, by a necessity of their
        natural constitution, continue in sin, and remain children of wrath. The
        answer is, God is incomprehensible throughout, and therefore His
        justice, as well as His other attributes, must be incomprehensible. It
        is on this very ground that St. Paul exclaims, “O the depth of the
        riches of the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and
        His ways past finding out!” Now, His judgments would not be past finding
        out, if we could always perceive them to be just.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
        make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the Apostle’s second answer to the objection contained in the
        19th verse, in which, by another reference to Scripture, he asserts that
        the thing formed ought not to contend with Him that formed it, who has a
        right to dispose of it as He pleases. The words in the original,
        translated ‘power’ in this verse and the following, are different. The
        word here employed is variously applied as signifying authority,
        license, liberty, right; but in its application to God there can be no
        question that it denotes power justly exercised. The mere power or
        ability of doing what God pleases, cannot be the meaning, for this is
        not the thing questioned. It is the justice of the procedure that is
        disputed, and it is consequently the justice of this exercise of power
        that must be asserted. With respect to all other beings, the license,
        liberty, or right referred to, may be, as it is, derived from a
        superior; but in this sense it cannot refer to God. When, therefore, it
        is said here that God has ‘power,’ it must mean that He may, in the
        instance referred to, use His power in conformity to justice. The right
        has not a reference to a superior as conferring it, but a reference to
        His own character, to which all the actions of this sovereignty must be
        conformable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power, then, in this place, signifies right or power which is consistent
        with justice. It is this right or power according to justice that is
        here asserted.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the potter molds the clay into what form he pleases, he does
        nothing contrary to justice; neither does God do injustice in the
        exercise of absolute power over His creatures. Out of the same original
        lump or mass He forms, in His holy sovereignty, one man unto honor, and
        another unto dishonor, without in any respect violating justice. Here it
        is implied that as there is no difference between the matter or lump out
        of which the potter forms diversity of vessels, so there is no
        difference in mankind, Romans 3:22; all men — both those who are
        elected, and those who are rejected, that are made vessels of mercy, or
        vessels of wrath — are alike by nature in the same condemnation in which
        God might in justice have left the whole, but out of which in His holy
        sovereignty He saves some, while He exercises His justice in pouring out
        His wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        That we are all in the hand of God as the clay in the potter’s hand, is
        humbling to the pride of man, yet nothing can be more self-evidently
        true.
      </p>
      <p>
        If so, God has the same right over us that a potter has over the clay of
        which he forms his vessels for his own purposes and interest. The same
        figure as is employed by the Prophet Isaiah, in declaring the right that
        God had over him and all the people of Israel, God likewise employs,
        Jeremiah 18:6: ‘O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter?
        saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye
        in Mine hand, O house of Israel.’ A potter forms his vessels for
        himself, and not for his vessels. This determines the question with
        respect to God’s end in the creation of man. Philosophers can discern no
        higher end in creating man than that of making him happy. But the chief
        end of the potter in molding his vessels has a reference to himself, and
        God’s chief end in making man is His own glory. This is plainly held
        forth in a multitude of passages in Scripture. Let man strive with his
        Maker as he will, still he is nothing but the clay in the hand of the
        potter. There cannot, indeed, be a question but that God will act justly
        with all His creatures; but the security for this is in His own
        character, and we can have no greater security against God’s power than
        His own attributes. God will do His creatures no injustice; but this is
        because justice is a part of His own character. Our security for being
        treated justly by God is in Himself. One vessel unto honor and another
        unto dishonor. — Some endeavor to explain this as implying that certain
        vessels may be made for a less honorable use, while they are still
        vessels for the Master’s service. But it is not said that they are made
        for a less honorable use, but that they are made to dishonor, is the
        Apostle’s assertion. It is true, indeed, that even vessels employed for
        dishonorable purposes are useful, and it is equally true that the
        destruction of the wicked will be for the glory of God. If any are
        condemned at all, and on any ground whatever, it is certain that it must
        be for the glory of God, else He would not appoint it to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the verse before us, and the preceding, it is to be observed that the
        Apostle does not say that his meaning in what he had previously affirmed
        had been mistaken, and that he had not said that it was agreeable to the
        will of God that the hardness of men’s hearts should take place as it
        does; he implicitly grants this as truth, and that he had asserted it.
        And so far from palliating or softening down the expression to which the
        objection is made, if possible, he heightens and strengthens it. All
        mankind are here represented as originally lying in the same lump or
        mass; a great difference afterwards appears among them. Whence does this
        difference arise? The Apostle explicitly answers, It is God who makes
        the difference. As the potter makes one vessel as readily as he makes
        another, and each vessel takes its form from his hand, so God makes one
        man to honor and another to dishonor. And God’s sovereign right to do
        this is here asserted; and he who objects to this, the Apostle says,
        speaks against God. Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it,
        Why hast Thou made me thus? This representation is entirely consistent
        with all that the Scriptures elsewhere teach. In the fundamental
        doctrine of regeneration and the new creation in Christ Jesus, it is
        expressly inculcated, and is entirely coincident with the question, ‘Who
        maketh thee to differ from another?’ 1 Corinthians 4:7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — What if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make his power
        known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
        destruction; In this and the following verse, in which the substance of
        the doctrine of predestination is contained in a few words, the Apostle
        gives his third and final answer to the objection stated in the 19th
        verse, subjoining the reasons of God’s different proceedings with one
        man and with another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hereby God manifests His great displeasure against sin, and His power to
        take vengeance on sinners; He exercises great patience towards them,
        seeing they are vessels of wrath fitted to destruction by their own
        wickedness, to which God shuts them up in His judgment. On the other
        hand, what can be said against it, if He proceed in mercy with others,
        thereby manifesting the riches of His glory, or His glorious grace,
        since they are vessels of mercy, whom, by His sovereign election from
        eternity, and the sanctification of His Spirit in time, He had afore
        prepared unto glory? The sum of the Apostle’s answer here is, that the
        grand object of God, both in the election and the reprobation of men, is
        that which is paramount to all things else in the creation of the
        universe, namely, His own glory. With the assertion of this doctrine,
        however offensive to the natural man, which must always appear to him
        foolishness, Paul winds up, in the last verse of the eleventh chapter,
        the whole of his previous discussion in this Epistle. What if God,
        willing to show His wrath. — Here the purpose of God, in enduring the
        wicked in this world, is expressly stated to arise from His willingness
        to show His wrath against sin. We see, then, that the entrance of sin
        into the world was necessary to manifest the Divine character in His
        justice and hatred of sin. Had sin never entered into the creation of
        God, His character would never have been fully developed. Let wicked men
        hear what God says in this place. They flatter themselves that in some
        way, through mercy, or because great severity, they suppose, would not
        be just, they will finally escape. But God here declares by the Apostle,
        that He has endured sin in the world for the very purpose of glorifying
        Himself in its punishment. How, then, shall they escape? And to make His
        power known. — The entrance of sin was also an occasion of manifesting
        God’s power and wisdom in overruling it for His glory. The power or
        ability of God, according to the original word used here, is different
        from the power (another word in the original) in the preceding verse, as
        is strikingly seen in this place. The 21st verse asserts the right of
        God to act in the manner supposed; this verse shows that His doing so
        was to manifest His wrath against sin, and His power to make even sin to
        glorify His name. Sin is in its own nature to God’s dishonor. He has
        overruled it so that He has turned it to His glory. This is the most
        wonderful display of power. Endured with much long-suffering. — How
        often do men wonder that God endures so much sin as appears in the
        world. Why does not God immediately cut off transgressors? Why does He
        not make an end of them at once? The answer is, He endures them for His
        own glory, and in their condemnation He will be glorified. To
        short-sighted mortals, it would appear preferable if God would cut off
        in childhood all whom He foresaw should continue in wickedness. But God
        endures them to old age, and to the utmost bounds of wickedness, for the
        glory of His own name. Vessels of wrath, — vessels ‘full of the fury of
        the Lord,’ Isaiah 51:20. Here Paul calls the wicked vessels, in allusion
        to the figure which he had just before used. Fitted to destruction. —
        They are vessels, indeed, but they are vessels of wrath, and by their
        sins they are fitted for destruction; and it is in the counsel of
        Jehovah that this shall be so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — And that He might make known the riches of His glory on the
        vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse, Paul had declared that God exercised much
        long-suffering towards the vessels of wrath — that part of Israel which
        were not of Israel; and here he shows that it was the will of God to
        make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy whom He had
        afore prepared unto glory. In men’s rejection of the salvation of
        Christ, the exceeding sinfulness of sin is manifested; and we learn that
        no external means, in truth, nothing short of almighty power, could save
        a guilty and lost creature. Those, therefore, who are called and saved
        are saved by a new creation; not effected by a word, as the old creation
        was, but by the power and calling of the Holy Spirit through the
        incarnation and death of the Son of God for the sins of His people, and
        His resurrection for their justification, made known in the everlasting
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse it is implied that the awful ruin of the wicked is
        necessary for the full display of the riches of Divine mercy in saving
        the elect. Both the righteous and the wicked are by nature equally
        exposed to wrath; and the deliverance of the elect from that situation
        to be made heirs of glory; wonderfully illustrates the infinitude of
        mercy. The salvation of the elect is mercy, pure mercy; and it is
        wonderful mercy, when we consider what was the doom they deserved, and
        would have experienced, had they not been delivered by God through Jesus
        Christ. These vessels of mercy were previously prepared for their happy
        lot by God Himself. Which He had afore prepared unto glory. — In the
        preceding verse it is said that the vessels of wrath are fitted for
        destruction, and in this verse, that the vessels of mercy are prepared
        unto glory. The wicked are fitted for destruction by their sins, and the
        elect prepared before by God unto glory. No particular stress is to be
        laid on the word fitted , as if it could not apply to the righteous, for
        they also are fitted for glory. It is usual to say that the wicked were
        fitted by Satan and their own folly for destruction. No doubt Satan is
        concerned in it, but as no agent is asserted, it is not necessary to
        determine this. They also may be said to fit themselves; yet it appears
        that it is not the agent, but the means that the Apostle has in view. It
        is their sins which fit them for destruction. On the other hand, the
        elect are afore prepared unto glory. This cannot be by themselves, but
        must be by God as the agent. This is expressly stated: ‘Whom He hath
        prepared.’ The elect are not only afore prepared unto glory, but it is
        God who prepares them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is suggested, by what is said in this and the preceding verse, that
        God does not harden sinners or punish them for the sake of hardening or
        making them miserable, or because He has any delight or pleasure in
        their sin or punishment considered in themselves, and unconnected with
        the end to be answered by them, but He does this to answer a wise and
        important end. This great end is the manifestation and display of His
        own perfections; to show His wrath, and to make His power known, and to
        make known the riches of His glory. That is, He does it for Himself —
        for His own glory. It is also suggested that what God does in hardening
        sinners, and making them vessels unto dishonor, and enduring with much
        long-suffering those vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, is
        consistent with their being blamable for their hardness, and for
        everything which renders them dishonorable. Consequently it is also
        consistent with His high displeasure at their conduct, and proves that
        He may justly destroy them for ever for their hardness and obstinacy in
        sin. This is supposed and asserted in the words, otherwise sinners could
        not be vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. To allege that these
        scriptures import no more than that God permits sin, and orders
        everything respecting the event, so that if God permits, it will
        certainly take place, does not obviate any difficulty which has been
        supposed here to present itself. For this is still representing God as
        willing that sin should take place, or, on the whole, choosing that it
        should exist rather than not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many who admit the doctrine of predestination object to the use of the
        term reprobation, so often employed by the first Reformers, and the old
        and most esteemed Christian writers. In its place they would substitute
        the word rejection. But that word does not always convey the full import
        of what is intended by the term reprobation; and whether this term be
        used or not, all that is comprehended under it is strictly according to
        Scripture. Reprobation includes two acts: the one is negative, which
        consists in what is called perpetration, or the passing by of those who
        are not elected, — that is, leaving them in their natural state of
        alienation or enmity against God; the other is positive, and is called
        condemnation, — the act of condemning on account of sin those who have
        been passed by.
      </p>
      <p>
        That first act consists in God’s simply withholding His grace, to which
        no man can have any claim. For this, accordingly, the Scriptures give no
        reason but the sovereign pleasure of God, who has mercy on whom He will
        have mercy, and who might justly have left all men to perish in their
        sins. In the second act, God considers man as guilty, and a child of
        wrath; and as on this account He punishes him in time, so from all
        eternity He has ordained to punish him. In electing sinners, then, or in
        passing them by, God acts as a sovereign dispensing or withholding His
        favors, which are His own, as to Him seemeth good. In condemning, He
        exercises His justice in the punishment of the guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        He may impart His grace to whomsoever He pleases, without any one having
        a right to find fault, since in regard to those whom He destines to
        salvation He has provided means to satisfy His justice. On the other
        hand, those who are guilty have no right to complain if He hath
        appointed them to wrath, 1 Thessalonians 5:9; 1 Peter 2:8; Jude 4; for
        God was under no obligation to exercise mercy towards sinners. Both
        these doctrines of election and reprobation are exemplified in the case
        of Jacob and Esau, in which there is nothing peculiar. Jacob was loved
        and chosen before he was born, and Esau before he was born was an object
        of hatred and reprobation. Under one or other of these descriptions, all
        who receive the above doctrines must be convinced that every individual
        of the human race is included. Whence comes it, then, that so many
        venture to set aside the obvious import of these words, ‘Jacob have I
        loved, but Esau have I hated? ’ The term reprobation has been used,
        then, because it expresses the idea intended, which the term rejection
        does not; if any are offended at it, it is to be feared that the offense
        taken is not at the word, but at its import.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless men reject the Bible, they must admit that all were condemned in
        Adam; and if they were justly condemned, there can be no injustice in
        leaving them in that state of condemnation, and punishing them as
        sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is only from the sovereign good pleasure and love of God that any of
        the human race are saved. He had no such love to the fallen angels, and
        they all perished; nor has He such love to those of the human race that
        shall perish, for He says, ‘Depart from Me, ye cursed, I never knew
        you.’ Men had no more claim upon God for mercy than the angels. Whatever
        may be thought of these things at present, God informs us that there is
        a day coming when His righteous judgment shall be revealed. Then He will
        be clear when He speaketh, and just when He is judged. No one shall then
        feel that he has been treated unjustly. Happy they whose high
        imaginations are cast down by the proclamation of mercy in the Gospel,
        and who receive the kingdom as Little children, becoming fools that they
        may be wise. The high imaginations of all will be cast down at last, but
        with very many it will be too late, except to make them feel their
        condemnation to be juSt. In strict conformity with the truths contained
        in the above verses, it is said in the Westminster Confession of Faith,
        which contains so scriptural a summary of Christian doctrine: — ’The
        almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God, so
        far manifest themselves in His providence, that it extendeth itself even
        to the first fall, and all other sins of angels and men, and that not by
        a bare permission, but such as hath joined with it a most wise and
        powerful bounding, and otherwise ordering, and governing of them, in a
        manifold dispensation, to His own holy ends; yet so, as the sinfulness
        thereof proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God, who, being
        most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approver of
        sin.’ ‘The decrees of God are His eternal purpose, according to the
        counsel of His will, whereby, for His own glory, He hath fore-ordained
        whatsoever comes to pass. God executeth His decrees in the works of
        creation and providence. God’s works of providence are, His most holy,
        wise, and powerful preserving and governing all His creatures and all
        their actions.’ And again, ‘God, the great Creator of all things, doth
        uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things,
        from the greatest even to the least, by His most wise and holy
        providence, according to His infallible foreknowledge, and the free and
        immutable counsel of His own will, to the praise of the glory of His
        wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and mercy.’ ‘By the decree of God, for
        the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestinated
        unto everlasting life, and others fore-ordained to everlasting death.’
        In these articles it is asserted that God fore-ordained, decreed, and
        willed the existence of all the evil which ‘comes to pass.’ It is also
        said that God brings His decrees or His will into effect by creation and
        His governing providence, by which, in the exercise of His wisdom and
        holiness, He powerfully governs His creatures, and superintends and
        directs, disposes and orders, all their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the above truths, so well expressed in the Westminster
        Confession of Faith, to which so many profess to adhere as containing
        their creed, everything without exception, great and small, that has
        ever taken place, or shall ever take place in heaven, or on earth, or in
        hell has from all eternity been ordained by God, and yet so that the
        accountableness of the creature is not in the smallest degree removed.
        This is declared in the clearest manner respecting the greatest sin that
        ever was committed, even the crucifying of the Lord of glory. It took
        place according to the express ordination of God, yet the wickedness of
        those by whom it was perpetrated is explicitly asserted. ‘Truly the Son
        of man goeth, as it was determined; but woe unto that man by whom He is
        betrayed’ Luke 22:22. ‘Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel
        and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
        crucified and slain.’ ‘Who by the mouth of Thy servant David hast said,
        Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings
        of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the
        Lord, and against His Christ. For of a truth against Thy holy child
        Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
        Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do
        whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined before to be done,’ Acts
        2:23, 4:25. The crucifixion, then, of the Messiah was ordained by God,
        ‘according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our
        Lord,’ Ephesians 3:11, and was carried into execution by the wickedness
        of men, while God was not the author or actor of the sin. f53 Every
        objection that can be made against the ordination of God respecting any
        wicked act, lies equally against these last two declarations. The
        crucifixion of Christ was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
        of God. If, then, the doctrine be chargeable with the consequences which
        some attribute to it, the admission of it in one case is just as
        impossible as in every case. It makes no difference how many evil
        actions are ordained, if it be admitted that one was ordained. The
        ordination of that one event must have been without reproach to the
        holiness of God, and this shows that the ordination of all others may be
        equally so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — Even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews only, but also
        of the Gentiles?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hitherto the Apostle had been showing that the promise of God was never
        made to the carnal seed of Abraham. This argument he began, ver. 6, 7,
        and had continued it till he comes to these words, in which he plainly
        states who are the true seed of Abraham and the children of the promise,
        even the called of God of all nations. The natural and easy manner in
        which, after several exemplifications, Paul here in a direct manner
        reverts to the main purpose of his discussion, ought not to be
        overlooked. Here he shows who are those vessels of mercy to whom he
        referred in the preceding verse. They are not only Jews but also
        Gentiles, and none of either Jews or Gentiles but those who are called
        by the Spirit and word of God. After expressing his unfeigned sorrow for
        the rejection of the Messiah by his countrymen in general, Paul had
        intimated at the 6th verse, that, notwithstanding this, the word of God
        had not been altogether without effect among them. He had next declared
        the reason why this effect had not been produced on the whole of them,
        namely, that all who belonged to that nation were not the true Israel of
        God, nor because they were descended from Abraham were they all his
        spiritual seed. This he had proved by the declarations of God to
        Abraham, and also by His dealings in regard to him, and especially
        respecting Isaac. In Isaac’s family God had in a remarkable manner
        typically intimated the same truth, and displayed His sovereignty in
        rejecting the elder of his sons, and choosing the younger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul had further proved that this was according to God’s usual manner of
        proceeding, in showing mercy to some, and hardening others. God had,
        notwithstanding, endured with much long-suffering that great multitude
        of the people of Israel who proved themselves to be vessels of wrath
        fitted for destruction; and, on the other hand, had displayed the
        abundance of His free grace in preparing vessels of mercy both among
        Jews and Gentiles. The word of God had thus been effectual by His
        sovereign disposal to some among the people of Israel, corresponding
        with the examples which Paul had produced from their history; and in the
        exercise of the same sovereignty God had also prepared others among the
        Gentiles on whom He displayed His mercy. None of the Jews or Gentiles
        were vessels of mercy, except those whom He had effectually called to
        Himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse incontestably proves, contrary to the erroneous glosses of
        many, that the Apostle is here speaking of the election of individuals,
        and not of nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — As He saith also in Osee, I will call them My people, which
        were not My people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse, the Apostle had spoken of those who were called
        among the Jews and the Gentiles, whom God had prepared unto glory. In
        this verse and the following, he shows that the calling of the Gentiles
        was not an unforeseen event, but that it was expressly foretold by the
        Prophets. God, by the Prophet Hosea 2:23, alluding to the calling of the
        Gentiles by the gospel says, I will say to them which were not My
        people, Thou art my people; that is, the Lord, at the period alluded to,
        would call to the knowledge of Himself, as His people, persons who were
        formerly living in heathenish, not having even the name of the people of
        God. And her beloved, that was not beloved. — The Jewish nation was
        typically the spouse of God. The Lord had betrothed Israel. But when
        Christ should come, He was to betroth Gentiles also, and to call her
        beloved that had not been beloved. Paul therefore shows, by this
        quotation, that the calling of these Gentiles as vessels of mercy was
        according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel
        of His own will — according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in
        Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was
        said unto them, Ye are not My people; there shall they be called the
        children of the living God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the nations which formerly served idols, and of whom it was
        usually and truly said that they were not God’s people, there will be
        those of whom it shall be said that they are the children of the living
        God, Hosea 1:10. They shall be the children of the living God, in
        opposition to the dead idols or gods of their own imagination, which
        they formerly worshipped. This proves that, in their former state, they
        were without God in the world, Ephesians 2:12, 4:18; and consequently
        that the Scriptures hold out no hope for those Gentiles who are left
        uncalled by the Gospel. This awful truth, though so many are unwilling
        to receive it, is everywhere testified in the Scriptures. It is held
        forth in what is said of the empire of Satan, the God of this world; and
        also in the character everywhere given in Scripture of heathens, who are
        declared not to have liked to retain God in their knowledge, and to have
        been ‘haters of God.’ It is also held forth in all the passages that
        affirm the final doom of idolaters; as likewise in all that is taught
        respecting access to God by Him who is the Way, and the Truth, and the
        Life; for there is no other name given among men whereby we must be
        saved. Men may devise schemes to extend the blessings of salvation to
        those who never heard of Christ, but they are opposed to the plain
        declarations of His word. How thankful, then, ought we to be that we
        have lived not in the days of our heathen fathers, when God suffered
        them to walk in their own ways, but in the times when the Gospel has
        visited the Gentiles! How thankful, above all, if we have been made
        indeed the children of the living God! The nations of Europe are in
        general called Christians; but it is only in name that the great body of
        them bear that title. God will not recognize any as His children who are
        not born again of His Spirit, and conformed to the image of His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 27. — Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of
        the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be
        saved: Having spoken in the 24th verse of those whom God had called,
        both among Jews and Gentiles, and having referred in the two preceding
        verses to what had been foretold of the Gentiles, the Apostle, in the
        verse before us and the two that follow, introduces the predictions
        relative to the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
        He quotes the Prophet Isaiah, as loudly testifying the doctrine which he
        is declaring. Hosea testifies with respect to God’s purpose of calling
        the Gentiles; and Isaiah, in the passage here quoted, 10:20-22,
        testifies of the rejection of the great body of the Jews, and of the
        election of a number among them comparatively small. The Israelites
        looked on themselves as being all the people of God, and on the Gentiles
        as shut out from this relation. The Prophet here shows that out of all
        those vast multitudes which composed their nation, only a remnant were
        to be among the number of the true Israel of God. Whatever fulfillment
        the prophecy had in the times of the Old Testament, this is its full and
        proper meaning, according to the Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first sight, it might seem that the Prophet speaks only of the return
        of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon; but, in regard to this, two
        things must be remarked. One is, that all the great events that happened
        to the Jews were figures and types, representing beforehand the great
        work of redemption by Jesus Christ. Thus the deliverance of the
        Israelites from Egypt, their passage through the Red Sea, and through
        the wilderness, the passage of Jordan, and their entrance into Canaan,
        were representations of what was to take place under the Gospel as is
        declared, 1 Corinthians 10:11, ‘Now all these things happened unto them
        for examples (types), and they are written for our admonition, upon whom
        the ends of the world are come.’ Hence it follows that the deliverance
        from the captivity of Babylon, and consequently the predictions
        respecting it in Scripture, are typical of the future condition of the
        Church of Christ. This prophecy, then, has two meanings, — the first
        literal, the second mystical. The other thing to be remarked is, that in
        the work of God in regard to His Church, there being several gradations
        which follow each other, it often happens that the Prophets, who viewed
        from a distance those future events, join together many of them, as if
        they related only to one and the same thing, — which is a characteristic
        of the spirit of prophecy. The Prophet, then, in this place joins the
        temporal re-establishment of the Jews with the spiritual building up of
        the Church of Christ, although these two things are quite distinct and
        separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        These words in this prophecy, ‘They shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy
        One of Israel, in truth,’ can only have their full accomplishment in
        believers in Jesus Christ. The same is the case respecting the words,
        ‘The remnant shall return;’ for this returning or conversion denotes
        much more than that of the return of the Jews from Babylon — even that
        glorious turning to God which takes place by the Gospel. And when the
        Prophet says, Though Thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
        remnant of them shall return it is clear that this is an allusion to the
        promise made to Abraham, that his posterity should be as the sand of the
        sea, and that he means to say that whatever confidence the Jews might
        place in that promise, taking it in a carnal and literal sense, yet that
        those who were saved would be a small remnant, whom God would take to
        Himself in abandoning all the rest to His avenging justice. As one
        event, then, in Scripture prophecy is often made to shadow forth and
        typify another, so the events of the Jewish history are made to
        illustrate the spiritual things of the kingdom of God. In this way the
        prophecies quoted in the New Testament from the Old are to be viewed,
        and not to be explained in a manner which ascribes to the Apostles of
        Christ that false and deceitful mode of quotation called accommodation,
        so disparaging to their character as stewards of the mysteries of God,
        and so degrading to the Holy Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — For He will finish the work, and cut it short in
        righteousness; because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This refers to God’s judgments poured out upon the Jews for rejecting
        the Messiah. They were then cut off manifestly from being His people. He
        cut short the work in righteous judgment. The destruction determined,
        denotes the ruin and desolation of the whole house of Israel, with the
        exception of a small remnant. It was to overflow in righteous judgment,
        which gives the idea of an inundation. But this not having place in the
        re-establishment of the Jews after the Babylonish captivity, must
        necessarily be understood of the times of the Gospel. It was then that
        the consumption decreed took place; for the whole house of Israel was
        rejected from the covenant of God, and consumed or dispersed by the fire
        of His vengeance by the Roman armies, with the exception of a small
        remnant. Formerly God had borne with them in their sins; but now, when
        they had heard the Gospel and rejected it, they were destroyed or
        carried away into captivity as with a flood. The Lord made a short work
        with them at the destruction of Jerusalem. This verse and the preceding
        confirm what is said in the 22nd verse, that although God endures the
        wicked for a time, He determines to punish them at last with sudden and
        overwhelming destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 29. — And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had
        left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrah.
      </p>
      <p>
        This, again, verifies another prediction of Isaiah 1:9. It was no doubt
        fulfilled in the events of the Jewish history; but in its proper and
        full sense, it extended to the times of the Messiah, and predicted the
        small number of Jews who were left, and the purpose for which they were
        left.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews who escaped destruction at the overthrow of their city by the
        Romans, were spared merely as a ‘seed’ from whence was to spring all the
        multitudes who will yet arise to Jesus Christ out of the seed of
        Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had it not been for this circumstance, not one individual at that time
        would have been left. They would have been all cut off as Sodom and
        Gomorrah. ‘Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
        be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened,’
        Matthew 24:22. Instead of remnant, the word employed by the Prophet, the
        Apostle substitutes the term seed, from the Septuagint translation,
        which, though the expression is varied, has a similar meaning, implying
        that after the whole heap besides was consumed, the remainder was
        reserved for sowing with a view to a future crop.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this quotation from Isaiah, the Apostle proves that the doctrine of
        the unconditional election of individuals to eternal life — that
        doctrine against which such objections are raised by many — far from
        being contrary to the ideas we ought to entertain of the goodness of
        God, is so entirely consistent with it, that except for this election,
        not one of the nation of Israel would have been saved. Thus the doctrine
        of election, very far from being in any degree harsh or cruel, as many
        who misunderstand it affirm, is, as we see here, a glorious
        demonstration of Divine goodness and love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had it not been for this election, through which God had before prepared
        vessels of mercy unto glory, neither Jew nor Gentile would have escaped,
        but all would have remained vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. In
        the case of the angels who sinned there was no election, and the whole
        were cast down to hell Had there been no election among men, the whole
        must in like manner have perished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 30. — What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
        after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the
        righteousness which is of faith:
      </p>
      <p>
        What shall we say then? — What is the result of all this discussion? The
        conclusion from the whole is, that those Gentiles who are called by God,
        of whom the Apostle had spoken in the 24th verse, who were not following
        righteousness, but were abandoned to every kind of wickedness, obtained
        true righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. This is an
        astonishing instance of mercy. Men who were ‘haters of God,’ and guilty
        of all abominations, as Paul had shown in the first chapter of this
        Epistle, were thus made partakers of that righteousness which is
        commensurate to all the demands of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 31. — But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,
        hath not attained so the law of righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever objection might be made to the doctrine the Apostle was here
        inculcating, a clear proof was offered in the case of the Gentiles which
        he had adduced, of the truth he had advanced and illustrated by the
        examples of Jacob and Esau, namely, that the purpose of God, according
        to election, is unchangeable, and that salvation is not of works, but of
        Him that calleth.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here was a wonderful instance of Divine sovereignty. The nation of
        Israel were following after righteousness, yet God, instead of giving it
        to them, bestowed it on those who were not even looking for it. How
        different is this from the ways of men! How does the proud heart of the
        self-righteous legalist revolt at such a view of the Divine conduct!
        Man’s wisdom cannot endure that God should in this sovereign way bestow
        His favors. But this is God’s way, and whoever will not submit to it,
        resists the will of God. Nay, whoever finds fault with it, attempts to
        dethrone the Almighty, and to undeify God. The whole plan of salvation
        is so ordered, ‘that no flesh should glory in His presence, but that,
        according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the
        Lord,’ 1 Corinthians 1:31.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 32. — Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it
        were by the works of the law: for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone;
        The Apostle here asks why the people of Israel did not attain to the
        righteousness they were seeking. The word ‘wherefore’ has no reference
        to election, or a supposed objection from it, as some understand. The
        question is asked to excite more attention to the answer; and the answer
        is, because they sought it in a way in which it is not to be found. The
        righteousness that answers the demands of the law, is the righteousness
        of God, which is received only by faith. The Jews, then, did not attain
        to it, because they sought it not by faith, but as of works of law. Some
        commentators lay stress on the phrase, ‘as it were by the works of the
        law,’ according to our translation, assigning as its meaning, that the
        Jews did not suppose they kept the law perfectly, but expected to make
        up for their deficiencies in one respect by abounding in others. But
        this is not well founded. The Jews sought righteousness ‘as by works of
        law;’ that is, as if righteousness was to be obtained by doing the works
        of the law. By the works of the law they could not obtain it, unless
        they perfectly obeyed the law. To this they could never attain. As,
        therefore, they would not submit to Christ, who alone has fulfilled the
        law, they failed in obtaining righteousness. For they stumbled at that
        stumbling-stone. — That is, they stumbled at Jesus Christ. Instead of
        choosing Him as the elect, precious foundation-stone, on which to rest
        their hope, they rejected Him altogether. They looked for a Messiah of a
        different character, and therefore they rejected the Christ of God. The
        Apostle thus charges it upon the Jews as their own fault that they did
        not attain to righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        They mistook the character of that law under which they were placed, by
        which, according to the testimony of their own Prophets, no man could be
        justified; and also the character of the Messiah who was promised, and
        so perverted that law, and rejected Him by whom alone they could be
        saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        They thus verified the words of the Apostle, — ’The natural man
        receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness
        unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
        discerned.’ Of this Paul exhibits himself as having been an example. In
        the seventh chapter of this Epistle, he shows how entirely he once
        mistook the extent of the law; and in the beginning of the chapter
        before us, that he once made it his boast that he was opposed to Christ
        as the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 33. — As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling-stone and
        rock of offense: and whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is written. — The Apostle here confirms what he had just said
        concerning the stone of stumbling, by quoting from two places of
        Scripture, Isaiah 8:14, 28:16. The stumbling, then, of the Jews at
        Christ, the rock of offense, was predicted by the Prophets It should
        not, therefore, appear strange to those who lived in the times when it
        was accomplished. A stumbling-stone and rock of offense. — This language
        of the Prophet, applied by the Apostle to our Lord Jesus Christ, ought
        to be particularly observed, — ’Sanctify the Lord of Hosts Himself; and
        let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread. And He shall be for a
        sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offense, to
        both the houses of Israel.’
      </p>
      <p>
        As here the Prophet speaks directly of God, and the Apostle applies what
        he says to Jesus Christ, it is a conclusive proof that Jesus Christ is
        God, and that He is declared to be so both in the Old Testament and the
        New.
      </p>
      <p>
        The designations of a stone, and a rock, are given to Jesus Christ, both
        presenting the idea that the great work of redemption rests solely on
        Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is its author, the foundation on which it rests, the center in which
        all its lines meet, and their origin from which they proceed. He is to
        that work what the foundation-stone and the rock on which it is erected
        are to the building, sustaining it, and imparting to it form and
        stability. In another sense, He is a stone of stumbling, occasioning His
        rejection by those who, not believing in Him, are cut off from communion
        with God. Behold, I lay in Zion. — This stone, or rock — this ‘sure
        foundation’ — is laid by God, according to the Apostle’s reference,
        Isaiah 28:16, ‘Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion
        for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone, a sure
        foundation.’ This stone was laid in Zion, the Church of God. It was laid
        by God Himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        That it was ‘a sure foundation,’ which could not fail, is evident from
        all the promises of God concerning the Messiah, of upholding Him as His
        elect, and ensuring to Him success, dominion, and glory, in His
        character of Mediator, Isaiah 42:1-8, 49:7-9.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the promises to the Church of old, of the Messiah as a future
        Savior, from the declaration made to our first parents in paradise, to
        the last prediction concerning Him delivered by the Prophet Malachi,
        demonstrate the impossibility that Christ, the foundation which God has
        laid, should fail. These promises were often renewed with great
        solemnity, and confirmed by the oath of God, as in Genesis 22:16-18. And
        in Psalm 89:3,4, it is said, ‘I have made a covenant with My chosen, I
        have sworn unto David My servant, thy seed will I establish for ever,
        and build up thy throne to all generations.’ Nothing is more abundantly
        set forth in Scripture as sure and irreversible than this promise and
        oath to David. The Scriptures expressly speak of it as utterly
        impossible that the everlasting dominion of the Messiah should fail. ‘In
        those days, and at that time, I will cause the Branch of Righteousness
        to grow up unto David, for thus saith the Lord, David shall never want a
        man to sit upon the throne of the house of Jacob.’ ‘If ye can break My
        covenant of the day, and My covenant of the night, and that there should
        not be day and night in their season; then may also My covenant be
        broken with David My servant, that he should not have a son to reign
        upon his throne,’ Jeremiah 33:15-21. David securely rested on this
        covenant concerning the future glorious work and kingdom of the Messiah,
        as all his salvation, and all his desire, and comforted himself that it
        was an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        As being that foundation laid by Himself, which therefore could not
        fail, God proceeded to save sinners in virtue of the work of the Messiah
        before He appeared, as if it had been already accomplished. On this
        stone and rock the saints of old rested, and built their comfort.
        Abraham saw Christ’s day and rejoiced, and all the others died in the
        faith of His advent.
      </p>
      <p>
        What a view does this give of the faithfulness of God, and the truth of
        the Scriptures; and what an inducement to rely securely upon the Rock of
        Ages! Its solidity is assured to us by Him whose voice shakes the
        heavens and the earth — by the revelation of the eternal purpose of God,
        which He purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord, Ephesians 3:11. Rock of
        offense. — While the Messiah was indeed the sure foundation which God
        had laid, He was, notwithstanding, as it was written, rejected by the
        great body of the Jewish nation. Had they understood the language of
        their own Scriptures, they would have seen that, instead of receiving
        their Messiah when He came, the Prophets had declared that they would
        stumble at the lowliness of His appearance, and generally reject His
        claims. And whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed. — But they
        did not all reject Him. Some of them, referred to in verse 24th, who
        were called of God, acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah, sent of God, and
        were comforted and saved by Him. They were not ashamed to own Him before
        the unbelieving part of their brethren, and they shall not be put to
        shame before Him at His second coming. It might be supposed that the
        followers of the Messiah would be honored in every country; on the
        contrary, they are hated and held in contempt. But when all other
        refuges fail, when Christ comes to judge the world, they shall not be
        ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        A free salvation becomes an offense to men on account of their pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        They cannot bear the idea of being indebted for it to sovereign grace,
        which implies that in themselves they are guilty and ruined by sin. They
        desire to do something, were it ever so little, to merit salvation, at
        least in part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salvation by a crucified Savior was in one way opposed to the pride of
        the Jews, and in another to that of the Greeks. The Jews expected a
        mighty conqueror, who should deliver them from a foreign yoke, and
        render them so powerful as to triumph over all the other nations of the
        earth; and in order to reconcile with these ideas what the Scriptures
        said of His humiliation, some among them supposed that there would be
        two Messiahs. The Greeks expected, in a revelation from heaven,
        something accordant with the systems of their vain philosophy, which
        might exalt their false notions of the dignity of man, and enlarge their
        boasted powers of understanding. All the unconverted reason in the same
        way. Those among them who call themselves Christians suppose that, not
        being perfect, they have need of Christ as a Savior to compensate for
        their deficiencies, and to give weight to their good works. They do not
        believe that they obey the law perfectly, but suppose that what is
        wanting will be supplied by Jesus Christ. Thus, except a man be born
        again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. The doctrine of the cross is,
        in one way or other, misunderstood by him, and Jesus Christ is a stone
        of stumbling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, by their forced criticisms, have in various ways perverted the
        meaning of this chapter. Among their other misrepresentations, they
        affirm that the Apostle does not speak of individual election to eternal
        life, but of the national election of the Jews. On the contrary, it is
        evident that in regard to the Jews he refers to their national
        rejection. The rejection of the Jewish nation, excepting a small
        remnant, according to the election of grace, which is again plainly
        declared in the beginning of the eleventh chapter, is the important
        subject which the Apostle illustrates by the examples and predictions he
        refers to, and the reasonings with which he follows them up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact of a remnant of Israel being reserved by God for Himself, while
        the great body of the nation was abandoned to merited punishment,
        demonstrates that the election here spoken of is individual and not
        national. The Prophets everywhere speak of this small remnant chosen by
        God to display His mercy and goodness. ‘I will also leave in the midst
        of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name
        of the Lord. The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak
        lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they
        shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid,’ Zephaniah
        3:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nothing which more clearly manifests the natural opposition of
        the mind of man to the ways of God, than the rooted aversion naturally
        entertained to the obvious view of the doctrine of the sovereignty of
        God held forth in this ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-righteous people, as is not to be wondered at, hold this doctrine
        in the utmost abhorrence; and many even of those, who are in some
        measure taught of God to value the great salvation, are reluctant to
        come to the serious study of this part of His word. Even when they are
        not able plausibly to pervert it, and when their conscience will not
        allow them directly to oppose it, with the Pharisees, they say that they
        do not know what to make of this chapter. But why are they at a loss on
        this subject?
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the difficulty which they find here? If it be ‘hard to be
        understood,’ does this arise from anything but the innate aversion of
        the mind to its humbling truths? Can anything be more palpably obvious
        than the meaning of the Apostle? Is there any chapter in the Bible more
        plain in its grammatical meaning? It is not in this that they find a
        difficulty. Their great difficulty is, that it is too obvious in its
        import to be perverted. Their conscience will not allow them to do
        violence to its language, and their own wisdom will not suffer them to
        submit to its dictation. Here is the solution of their difficulties. But
        ought not believers to renounce their own wisdom, and look up to God, in
        the spirit of him who said, ‘Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Men may attempt to explain away the example referred to in this chapter,
        of God’s hardening Pharaoh’s heart. But still the truth remains, that
        for the very purpose of showing His power and proclaiming His name and
        sovereignty, God raised him up and hardened his heart. Many will not
        receive this, and resort to every means they can devise to neutralize or
        controvert it; but God has testified it, and the Apostle illustrates it
        by a striking figure. God makes one vessel to honor, and another to
        dishonor, with the same uncontrolled right as the potter has power over
        the clay, and out of the same lump he makes one vessel for the noblest
        purpose, and another for the basest uses. Where is sovereignty, if it is
        not here?
      </p>
      <p>
        Could words express it if these words do not express it? Why, then, will
        men vainly struggle in so unequal a contest? Can they hope to succeed
        against God? If this doctrine be really declared in this chapter, of
        what avail will all their forced explanations be to deliver any of the
        enemies of God? ‘God is greater than man, why dost thou strive against
        Him? for He giveth not account of any of His matters.’ There are,
        however, too many, even of the disciples of Christ, who are disposed to
        explain away the sovereignty of God, and to give a view of our fall in
        Adam which considerably mitigates the extent of our ruin, and the
        magnitude of our guilt. The statements contained in this chapter are to
        such full of clouds and darkness. While they cannot altogether deny the
        truths it contains, they profess their inability to receive them in
        their plain and obvious meaning. ‘This doctrine of the sovereignty of
        God,’ says Dr. Thomson, ‘we believe to be one of the greatest
        stumbling-blocks in the Gospel to the advocates of universal redemption.
        They lay down a scheme of Divine love which they have framed only in
        part from the materials furnished by the Bible, and have otherwise
        fashioned according to the dictates of their own wisdom, and the
        sensibilities of their own hearts. And as it is inconsistent with this,
        so they cannot endure to consider the Supreme Being as communicating His
        benefits to men, or withholding them, according to the pleasure and
        counsel of His own will. God has said, ‘I will have mercy, and I will
        have compassion on whom I will have compassion, and whom I will I
        harden.’ But they have settled in their own minds that God must have
        compassion and mercy upon all, and that He must harden none. And in
        rebuke of this arrogance, we have only to say, Nay but, who art thou
        that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed
        it, Why hast Thou made me thus?’

        The doctrine of the sovereignty of God is derogatory to the pride of
        man; it lays all his high notions of independence in the dust, and
        reduces him, when acknowledged, to a sense of his utter helplessness and
        misery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy, nevertheless, are they who have learned this lesson, for it is
        one which flesh and blood cannot teach, but only our Father which is in
        heaven. In the light of this chapter these see themselves as lying
        entirely in the hand of God, having nothing that distinguishes them from
        others, but His sovereign will and favor in their election. It is this
        view of their situation that brings down every high imagination, and
        levels to the dust every high thought. Here Divine sovereignty reigns in
        its most awful character; and nothing else, when it is fully acquiesced
        in, is so much calculated to tranquilize the mind of man, and to bring
        it into its proper position in relation to God. How many bitter
        reflections and how many vain regrets would be saved, were the Christian
        at all times habitually and practically to recognize the sovereignty of
        the Divine Disposer in all the events which happen in the world!

        Whatever difficulties are found in the doctrine of the sovereignty of
        God, and in the truth that He ordains for His own glory whatever comes
        to pass, yet this, it is clear, is the doctrine of Scripture from
        beginning to end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every part of it represents God as ordering and directing all events;
        and without this, and were anything left to depend or be regulated by
        the will of His creatures, He would cease to be the supreme Ruler. Many
        things might occur which He greatly desired might never have taken place
        — an idea altogether incompatible with that which we are taught in His
        word to form of the almighty Ruler of the universe. If we lose sight of
        sovereignty, we lose sight of God.
