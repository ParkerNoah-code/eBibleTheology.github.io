      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 7. — What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
        not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law
        had said, Thou shalt not covet. What Shall we say then! Is the law sin!
        — In the 5th verse Paul had described the effect of the law on himself
        and those whom he addressed before conversion, while he and they were
        under its dominion. In the 6th verse he had spoken of their deliverance
        and his own from the law; here and in the four following verses he
        illustrates what were the effects of the law on himself. While he
        peremptorily rejects the supposition that there was anything evil in the
        law, he shows that, by the strictness of its precepts exciting the
        corruptions of his heart, it was the means of convincing him that he was
        a sinner, and under its condemnation, and was thus the instrument to him
        of much good, for he would not have known sin to be sin but by the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart says this is the language of an objector against the Apostle.
        For this there is no foundation whatever. It is a mere figment to
        suppose that there is here a kind of discussion between the Apostle and
        a Jewish objector. It is an objection stated by the Apostle in his own
        name, an objection that will occur to the carnal mind in every age and
        country, and is therefore properly introduced by the Apostle. If the law
        occasions more sin, is it not itself sinful? God forbid — literally, let
        it not be, by no means. — It is the expression, as formerly noticed, by
        which the Apostle usually intimates his abhorrence of whatever is
        peculiarly unworthy of God. Paul now begins to describe his own
        experience respecting the operation of the law. Nay. — Mr. Stuart says
        that this expression intimates that the Apostle had some exception to
        the universal sense of the words translated God forbid. But this is not
        the effect here of the word rendered ‘Nay.’ There could be no exception
        to the denial of the consequence in the sense in which the thing is
        denied. Is it possible that there can be any exception to the denial
        that the law is sinful? It is not possible. That the law is the occasion
        of sin, or, as Mr. Stuart expresses it, though ‘not the sinful or
        efficient cause of sin,’ is no exception to the universal denial in any
        point of view. An occasion of sin and a cause of sin are two things
        essentially different. It is no exception to the assertion that the law
        is not the cause of sin, to say that it is the occasion of sin. The word
        here translated nay, intimates opposition. So far from the law being
        sinful, I had not known sin, says the Apostle, but by the law. Known sin
        but by the law. — Paul does not say that he would not have been a sinner
        without the law, but that he would not have known sin as now he knew it,
        or have seen himself to be a sinner. Now, though no man is without sin,
        yet a proud Pharisee might think himself free from sin by his keeping
        the law, when he did not look to it as extending to the thoughts of the
        heart. Paul, referring to his state before his conversion, says that,
        touching the righteousness of the law he was blameless, Philippians 3:6;
        and it was only when he understood the law in its full extent, that he
        became self-condemned. For I had not known lust. — The original word for
        lust signifies strong desire, whether good or bad. Here it is used in as
        bad sense. It is that disposition by which we are inclined to evil, —
        the habit and inclination to sin, and not merely the acts which proceed
        from it. It is evident that the Apostle here speaks of this habit, that
        is to say, of our inclination to sin, and habitual corruption; for he
        distinguishes this inclination from its acts in verse 8th, saying, sin,
        taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of
        concupiscence, or lust. Accept the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. —
        Without the law he would not have known that the desire of what is
        forbidden is sinful; that the very thought of sin is sin, is known only
        by the word of God. Indeed, many who hear that word will not receive
        this doctrine. The Roman Catholics hold that such desires are not
        criminal, if the mind do not acquiesce in them. Thou shalt not covet. —
        This implies lusting against the will of God, and extends to the first
        rise and lowest degree of every evil thought. It is not to be confined
        to what are called inordinate desires, or desires carried to excess, but
        comprehends every desire contrary to the commandment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
        manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same word rendered lust in the foregoing verse is here rendered
        concupiscence, which is not so proper a translation, having a more
        limited meaning generally attached to it. In both verses the original
        word indicates our natural inclination to sin, and not voluntary sinful
        acts — not sins produced, which are the acts proceeding from lust, but
        our innate and vicious propensity to sin producing those acts. In the
        preceding verse Paul had shown that the law does not cause sin, but
        discovers it, stripping it of its disguise, and bringing it to light.
        Here he asserts that the commandment discovered to him the sinful nature
        of evil desires. It laid on him the most solemn obligations to resist
        them; and the natural corruption of his heart took occasion, from the
        restraints of the law, to struggle against it, and break out with more
        violence. Sin, he says, wrought in him all manner of lust. It excited
        and discovered in him those corruptions of which he had been
        unconscious, until they were encountered and provoked by the restraints
        of the law. It does not appear that it is by feeling the curse and
        condemnation of the law that sin takes occasion by the law to work in us
        all manner of concupiscence. By feeling the curse and condemnation of
        the law, the impenitent sinner is excited to hate the law and to hate
        God. But the thing to which we are here said to be excited is not this,
        but we are excited to does, things forbidden by the law. It is quite
        true that the feeling of the condemnation of the law aggravates the evil
        of our hearts, but it is lust or concupiscence that is here said to be
        inflamed by the prohibitions of the law, nothing can more clearly
        discover the depravity of human nature than the holy law of God, the
        unerring standard of right and wrong becoming an occasion of sin; yet so
        it is. Whatever is prohibited is only the more eagerly desired. So far,
        then, was the law from subduing the love of sin, that its prohibitions
        increased the desire of what is prohibited. It may restrain from the
        outward act, but it excites the evil inclinations of the mind. Without
        the law sin was dead. — Some understand this as meaning the same with
        the declaration, that ‘where there is no law there is no transgression;’
        but the connection requires that we understand it of the sleeping or
        dormant state of sin. The Apostle would not have been without sin, but
        he would not have felt the action of his unlawful desires, if the
        strictness of the commandment had not become the occasion of exciting
        and making them manifest; for without the law, sin, or the workings of
        his corrupt nature, encountering no opposition, their operation would
        not have been perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Christian knows by experience the truth of all the Apostle
        declares in this verse. He knows that, as soon as his eyes were opened
        to discover the spirituality of the law, he discerned in himself the
        fearful working of that corruption in his heart, which, not being
        perceived before, had given him no uneasiness. He knows that this
        corruption was even increased in violence by the discovery of the
        strictness of the law, which makes not the smallest allowance for sin,
        but condemns it in its root, and in its every motion. ‘The wicked
        nature,’ says Luther, ‘cannot bear either the good, or the demands of
        the law; as a sick man is indignant when he is desired to do all that a
        man in health can do.’ Such is the effect of the law when the eyes of
        the understanding are first opened by the Spirit of God. A power,
        formerly latent and ineficacious, then appears on a sudden to have
        gathered strength, and to stand up in order to oppress and defeat the
        purposes of the man, who hitherto was altogether unconscious of the
        existence in himself of such evils as those which he now perceives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment
        came, sin revived, and I died.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul was alive without the law when he thought proudly of his good life;
        but when the commandment came with the power of the Spirit, then it slew
        him, and destroyed all his legal hopes. I was alive. — That is, in my
        own opinion. Mr. Stuart finds fault with this sense, as given by
        Augustine, Calvin, and many others. But his reasons are without weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        After exhibiting the meaning of the whole connection in this view, he
        asks, ‘Is this, then, the way in which the law of God proves fatal to
        the sinner, viz., by convincing him of the true and deadly nature of
        sin? ‘Not fatal to the sinner, but fatal to his view of salvation by the
        law. Nothing can be clearer than this passage, and nothing more
        consistent than this meaning with the whole context. Without the law
        once. — Was Paul ever without the law? He was in ignorance of it till
        his conversion; and this he here calls being without the law. He was
        ignorant of its spirituality, and consequently had no true discernment
        of his innate corruption. Mr. Stuart asks, ‘But when did the commandment
        come?’ and answers, ‘We may suppose it to be in childhood, or in riper
        years.’ It cannot have been in childhood, or in riper years, at any time
        previous to his seeing Christ. For if he had had such a view of the law
        previously, he would not, in his own opinion, have been blameless
        concerning its righteousness. It is obvious that Paul had his proper
        view of the law only in the cross of Christ. When the commandment came.
        — That is, when he understood the true import of the commandment as
        forbidding the desire of anything prohibited by the law. He had heard
        and studied it before in its letter; but never till then did it come in
        its full extent and power to his conscience. All men know that, to a
        certain extent, they are sinners; but from this passage and its context,
        in which the Apostle gives an account of his own experience both in his
        unconverted and renewed state, we learn that unconverted men do not
        perceive the sin that is in them in its root, called, in the 7th and 8th
        verses, ‘lust’ or ‘concupiscence.’ This is only felt and known when, by
        the Holy Spirit, a man is convinced of sin — when, as it is here said,
        the commandment comes — when it comes to him with power, so that he
        perceives its real extent and spiritual import. He then discerns sin,
        not only in its various ramifications and actings, both internal and
        external, but also sees that it is inherent in him, and that in his
        flesh dwells no good thing; that he is not only by nature a sinner and
        an enemy to God, but that he is without strength, Romans 5:6, entirely
        unable to deliver himself from the power of sin, and that this can only
        be effected by the Spirit of God, by whom he is at the same time
        convinced of the righteousness of God — that righteousness which has
        been provided for those who are destitute in themselves of all
        righteousness. Sin revived. — It was, in a manner, dead before, dormant,
        and unobserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the law was understood, it was raised to new life, and came to
        be perceived as living and moving. The contrast is with sin as dead,
        without the understanding of the law. It is true, as Mr. Stuart
        observes, that sin gathers additional strength in such circumstances;
        but this is not the idea held forth in the context. I died. — That is, I
        saw myself dead by the law, as far as my own observance of the law was
        concerned. All Paul’s hopes, founded on what he was in himself, were
        destroyed, and he discovered that he was a sinner condemned by the law;
        so that the law which promised life to those who observed it, to which
        he had looked for justification, he now saw subjected him to death. The
        expression by no means imports, as Mr. Stuart understands it, that Paul
        at the period referred to was really under the sentence of death as a
        sinner who had not fled to Jesus. ‘I fell under the sentence of death’
        is the explanation that Mr. Stuart goes; which he confirms by ‘The soul
        that sinneth shall die.’ ‘The wages of sin is death.’ At the period when
        Paul died, in the sense of this passage, he was really brought to
        spiritual life. It was then that he, through the law, became dead to the
        law, that he might live unto God, Galatians 2:19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus Paul was without the law during all that time when he profited in
        the Jews’ religion above many of his equals, when, according to the
        straightest sect of their religion, he lived a Pharisee, and when, as
        touching the law, according to the common estimation, he was blameless.
        He was without the true knowledge of it and its spiritual application to
        his heart; but, in his own esteem, he was alive. He was confident of the
        Divine favor. Sin lay as dead in his heart. He could therefore go about
        to establish his own righteousness. He had not found the law to be a
        ‘killing letter,’ working wrath; so far from it, he could make his boast
        of the law, and assume it as the ground of his rejoicing before God. But
        when the commandment came, sin revived, and he died. Such is the account
        which Paul now gives of himself, who declared, Acts 22:3, that formerly
        he had been, and, as he affirms in the beginning of the tenth chapter of
        this Epistle, that the unconverted Jews still were, ‘zealous towards
        God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to
        be unto death.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the commandment, which was ordained to life. — Literally, the
        commandment which was unto life. That is, which was appointed to give
        continuance of life to those who obeyed, and which, therefore, it would
        have been life to obey, as it is said, ‘The man that doeth them shall
        live in them.’ By the commandment here referred to, the law, in all its
        parts, appears to be meant, with a special allusion to the tenth
        commandment, which shows that the desire of what is forbidden is sin.
        This commandment might well be put for the whole law; for it could not
        be obeyed without the whole law being kept. As the law held out the
        promise of life to those who obeyed it, on this ground Paul had sought,
        and imagined he had attained, a title to eternal life. Unto death. — The
        law was ordained to life, but, through sin, it was found to be unto
        death. As soon, then, as it came home to his conscience, Paul found
        himself condemned by that law from which he had expected life, for,
        though it could not justify a sinner, it was powerful to condemn him. It
        then destroyed all the hope he had founded on it, and showed him that he
        was obnoxious to the curse which it pronounces on all transgressors. The
        law, however, which was ordained to life, will at last be proved to have
        attained this object in all in whom it has been fulfilled, Romans 8:4,
        by Him who is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
        believeth. All such shall, according to its original appointment, enjoy
        everlasting life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — For sin, taken occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and
        by it slew me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sin, by blinding his mind as to the extent of the demands of the law,
        had led Paul to believe that he could fulfill it, and so obtain
        justification and life, and had thus by the law taken occasion to
        deceive him. Till the commandment came home to him in its spiritual
        application, sin was never brought to such a test as to make a discovery
        to Paul of its real power. But when he was enlightened to perceive this,
        sin by the law slew him. It showed him that he was a transgressor of the
        law, and therefore condemned by that very law from which he had before
        expected life. Thus sin, as he had said, revived, and he died. All his
        high thoughts of himself, and self-confidence, from supposing that he
        had kept the law, were swept away and destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and
        just, and good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having now shown that the law is not the cause, but only the occasion of
        sin, Paul here draws the conclusion as to its character and excellence.
        Wherefore. — In the 7th verse he had strongly denied that there was
        anything sinful in the law; and, in the intermediate verses, had shown,
        by its effects, that, so far from being the cause of sin, it had been
        the means of enlightening his mind, in giving him to discover the evil
        nature of sin, and its deceitful workings in himself. From these effects
        he now draws the conclusion here stated, which fully illustrates the
        above assertion, proving how far the law is removed from sin, namely,
        that it is holy, and just, and good. The two words, law and commandment,
        appear to be used to give the greater force to his declaration, — thus
        meaning the law and every precept it enjoins. It is holy, in opposition
        to whatever is sinful, holy, as embodying the perfect rule of what is
        right and conformable to the character of God, and a transcript of His
        perfections. It is just. Can anything be more just than that we should
        abstain from all that God prohibits? It is highly just that we should
        not only abstain from all that God forbids, but that we should not even
        desire what is forbidden. The law demands what is equitable, and due to
        God, and nothing more, — and what is just and equitable in regard to
        man; and a just law could demand no less. And good. — It is not only
        just, it is also good. It is good in itself, and its whole tendency is
        adapted to maintain perfect order, and to establish in the highest
        degree the happiness of all who are under its authority. Every
        commandment of the Decalogue tends to promote human happiness. This is
        the glory of the law, and shows that it proceeds from the Giver of every
        good and perfect gift — from Him who alone is good. But this is not the
        ground of obedience; and those who have endeavored to place the
        foundation of morals on the principle of utility, or of the happiness of
        the many, have only proved their shortsighted ignorance, and verified
        the declaration of Scripture, ‘professing themselves to be wise, they
        become fools.’
      </p>
      <p>
        From the nature of the Apostle’s description of the glory and excellence
        of the law, it is clear that he is speaking of the Decalogue, and not of
        the ceremonial law or the Mosaic institutions. These had a figurative
        excellence ‘for the time present,’ but ‘made nothing perfect,’ as he
        himself declares in the Epistle to the Hebrews, but consisted only in
        ‘carnal ordinances’ intended to continue ‘until the time of
        reformation.’ But the law as embodied in the ten commandments, is in
        itself eternal and immutable, while the words of the Apostle in this
        verse beautifully accord with those of the Psalmist in the nineteenth
        Psalm: — ’The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the
        testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of
        the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is
        pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for
        ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More
        to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also
        than honey and the honey-comb.’ If God had left men free from the law,
        it would still be for the happiness of society that they should strictly
        obey its precepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid.
      </p>
      <p>
        But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is
        good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. Was
        that then which is good made death unto me? — This is not, as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight supposes, an objection in the person of a Jew, but an
        objection put by the Apostle himself, which was likely to occur to every
        carnal man in every age. It might require an answer even with respect to
        Christians themselves. If the law is holy, and just, and good, how could
        it be found by the Apostle to be unto death? Could a good law be the
        cause of death?
      </p>
      <p>
        By no means, It was not the good law that was the cause of death. But
        sin. — That is, it is sin, which is the transgression of the law, that
        causeth death. That it might appear sin. — Dr. Macknight translates,
        ‘That sin might appear working out death.’ But the construction
        evidently is, ‘But sin has caused death, that it might appear sin,’ —
        that is, that it might manifest itself in its own proper character.
        Working death in me by that which is good. — It was not the good law
        that wrought death in him, but sin by means of the good law. Hence the
        manifestation of the exceeding vileness and hatefulness of sin. How evil
        must that thing be which works the greatest evil through that which is
        the perfection of righteousness! That sin by the commandment might
        become exceeding sinful. — This, again, is another form of expression
        designed to aggravate the evil character of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nothing worse than sin itself. The Apostle, then, does not
        resolve it into supposed first principles that would exhibit its guilt.
        The worst that can be said of it is, that it is sin, and is so in
        excess. Here, and in the preceding verses from the 7th, Paul does not
        speak merely of outward sin, or sinful acts, but also, and chiefly, of
        the sinful and disordered lusts of the mind, or the depraved inclination
        to commit sin; and this naturally conducts him, in what follows to the
        end of the chapter, to describe and dwell on the workings of that inward
        evil disposition which he calls the law of sin in his members. It was by
        having his attention turned to this inward working of sin, when, as he
        says, ‘the commandment came,’ that he was convinced he was a sinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — For we know that the law is spiritual; bat I am carnal, soil
        under sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the foregoing part of the chapter, the Apostle had illustrated the
        truth that believers are dead to the law by the sacrifice of Christ. He
        had next shown the effects of the law on Himself before his conversion,
        when he was under it, and after his conversion, when delivered from it.
        During the former period, he was ignorant of its true nature, and
        consequently of himself, supposing that he was righteous. ‘I was alive
        without the law.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But when he understood its real character, he discovered the
        deceitfulness and sinfulness of sin closely cleaving to him, and
        inherent in him. ‘When the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.’
        He had remarked that sin, taking occasion by the commandment, had
        wrought in him all manner of evil desires, and had deceived him. He
        affirms, nevertheless, that the law is holy, and just, and good; and,
        lastly, he now further asserts that it is spiritual. This last
        characteristic of the holy law, proving that it takes cognizance not
        only of the outward conduct, but also of the thoughts and intents of the
        heart, leads him, as has just been observed, to show how far sin still
        continued to adhere to and afflict him. The view, however, which he
        gives, through the remainder of the chapter, of this working of sin in
        his members, in no respect contradicts his assertion in the preceding
        chapter, that believers are ‘dead to sin;’ for there he refers
        exclusively to its guilt, but here to its power. Nor does it contradict
        his affirmation that sin should ‘not have dominion’ over them; for,
        notwithstanding the struggle he describes, proving the power of the law
        of sin in his flesh, he asserts that with his mind he serves the law of
        God; while he expresses his conviction that even from that power of
        indwelling sin God would finally deliver him.
      </p>
      <p>
        From all this we see how naturally the Apostle was conducted to detail
        in what follows his own personal and internal experience, both past and
        present, which formed also so full an illustration of his leading
        argument throughout the whole of the previous part of the Epistle, of
        the impossibility of a just law justifying those by whom it is not
        perfectly obeyed. For we know. — This assertion, ‘we know,’ is the usual
        form under which Paul states what needs no proof. This fundamental and
        important truth, that the law is spiritual, although, while in his
        unconverted state, he was ignorant of it, he now affirms that both he
        and they to whom he wrote knew it. It is a thing of which no Christian
        is ignorant. All Christians know it experimentally. They know it when
        the commandment comes to them, not in word only, but also in power, and
        in the Holy Ghost; when, according to the promise of the new covenant,
        God puts His law in their inward parts, and writes it in their hearts;
        when they receive it, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
        living God, — not outwardly in tables of stone, but in the fleshly
        tables of the heart. The law is spiritual. — The law which proceeds from
        the Holy Spirit of God, demands not only the obedience of external
        conduct, but the internal obedience of the heart. If Paul had still
        regarded the law as a rule extending merely to his outward conduct, he
        might, as formerly, when he strictly adhered to its letter, have
        continued to suppose himself just and good. But when he now understood
        that it was also spiritual, extending to the most secret desires of his
        heart, he discovered in himself so much opposition to its penetrating
        and discerning power, that, as he had said, sin revived, and he died.
        Perceiving, then, that it requires truth in the inward parts, piercing
        even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, not only prohibiting
        the smallest outward deviation from holiness, but detecting every hidden
        ambush of the deceitful heart, Paul the Apostle, a man of like passions
        with ourselves, exclaims, I am carnal, sold under sin. He here begins to
        declare his present experience, and changes the past time for the
        present, in which he continues afterwards to speak to the end of the
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having so fully declared the nature and extent of the law, the Apostle
        now, applying the whole to his own case, proceeds to exhibit in its
        light the inward state of his own mind. And all he here says is entirely
        conformable to every description in the word of God of man in his
        present fallen condition; for ‘if we say that we have no sin, we deceive
        ourselves, and the truth is not in us.’ Thus, in the most forcible and
        impressive manner, Paul, in declaring his own experience, exhibits the
        light which the law in its spiritual aspect also sheds on the character
        of all other believers, in whom, notwithstanding that they are renewed
        in the spirit of their minds, the old man is not yet dead, nor the body
        of sin altogether destroyed. For if such was the state of mind of Paul
        the Apostle in regard to the remainder within him of indwelling sin, and
        the working of the old man, where is the Christian that can suppose that
        he is exempted from that inherent corruption, and that internal
        spiritual warfare, which, in the following context, the Apostle so
        feelingly describes? I am carnal. — This respects what the Apostle was
        in himself. It does not imply that he was not regenerated, but shows
        what he was even in his renewed state, so far as concerned anything that
        was natural to him. Every Christian in this sense is carnal: in himself
        he is corrupt. Paul applies the epithet carnal to the Corinthians,
        although they were sanctified in Christ Jesus, and even in the same
        sentence in which he denominates them carnal he calls them babes in
        Christ. The word carnal, how ever, has not here exactly the same meaning
        that it has in 1 Corinthians 3:3. The Corinthians were comparatively
        carnal. Their disputes and envying showed their attainments in the
        Divine life to be low. But, in the sense of the word in this place, all
        Christians — the best on earth not excepted — are always carnal. They
        are so when compared with the spiritual law of God. They have an evil
        principle in their hearts or nature. While in this world, Adam lives in
        them, called the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitful
        lusts. Sold under sin. — Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart suppose that this
        expression decidedly proves that this account of carnality belongs not
        to the regenerate, but only to the unregenerate. It has, however, no
        such import. All men have been sold under sin by the fall, and as long
        as any of the evil of their nature, introduced by the fall, remains in
        them, so long do they remain sold under sin, to whatever extent and in
        what ever respect it exists. The Christian, it is true, receives a new
        nature, and the old nature is mortified; but it still lives, and, so far
        as it lives, the individual is properly said to be sold under sin. The
        old nature is not made holy, but a new nature is communicated. As far,
        then, as the old man manifests himself, and acts, so far even the
        Christian is sold under sin. It is not to be admitted, as these writers
        take it for granted, that the phrase imports the height of wickedness.
        Let it be remarked, also, that, as signifying the greatest wickedness,
        the expression is not more suitable to their own view, than it is to
        that of those whom they oppose. If the Apostle speaks of unregenerate
        men, it must be in a character that will suit all unregenerate men. But
        all unregenerate men are not excessively abandoned to wickedness. Many
        of them are moral in their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking to the external form of the law, the Apostle declares (
        Philippians 3:6) that he was, in his unconverted state, blameless; and
        in respect to his conduct afterwards as before men, he could appeal to
        them ( 1 Thessalonians 2:10) how holily, and justly, and unblameably he
        had behaved himself among them. But in referring, also, as he does here,
        to what is internal, and therefore speaking as before God, who alone
        searcheth the heart, and measuring himself by the holy law in all its
        extent, he confesses himself to be carnal and sold under sin. His
        nature, or old man, was entirely opposed to the spirituality of the law.
        He felt a law or power within him against which he struggled, from which
        he desired to be free, but which still asserted its tyrannical
        authority. Notwithstanding the grace he had obtained, he found himself
        far from perfection, and in all respects unable, though ardently
        desiring, to attain that much wished for object. When he says he is
        carnal — sold under sin — he expresses the same sentiment as in the 18th
        verse where, distinguishing between his old and new nature, he says, ‘in
        me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing;’ or, as he speaks
        elsewhere concerning the old man in believers, ‘which is corrupt
        according to the deceitful lusts,’ which he exhorts them to put off. It
        ought to be noted that, when the Apostle says, I am carnal, sold under
        sin, it is the language of bitter complaint, as appears from the sequel,
        and especially from the 24th verse, which expresses a feeling respecting
        sin that does not belong to any unregenerate man.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is, then, in comparing himself with the holy, just, good, and
        spiritual law, now come home in its power to his conscience, that the
        Apostle here declares himself to be carnal, sold under sin. The law
        requires us to love God with all our heart, and with all our soul, and
        with all our mind, and with all our strength; and our neighbor as
        ourselves. Of this, every man in his best state, and in his very best
        thought or action, falls continually short. He proceeds a certain length
        in his obedience, but beyond that he cannot go. And why is it that into
        the region beyond this he does not advance? Because he is carnal, sold
        under sin. The sin that remains in him binds him so that he cannot
        proceed. Sin, however, does not reign over him; otherwise, as it is
        directly opposed to every degree of obedience to the law, it would not
        suffer him to do anything, even the least, in conformity to the will of
        God. Yet it so far prevails as to hinder him, as is here immediately
        added, from doing the good that he would, and in so far he is sold under
        it. It therefore prevents him from attaining to that perfection of
        obedience to the law of God which is the most earnest desire of every
        Christian, and to which the believer shall attain when he sees his
        blessed Lord as He is, 1 John 3:2. That Paul had not attained to this
        state of perfection, he in another place assures us, Philippians 3:12.
        ‘Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect.’
        How, then, are these expressions, carnal, sold under sin, inapplicable
        to the Apostle?
      </p>
      <p>
        If Paul had said he had no sin, he would have deceived himself, and the
        truth would not have been in him, 1 John 1:8. And if he had sin, and was
        unable to free himself from its power, was he not carnal, sold under it?
        There was spirit in him, but there was also flesh, and in his flesh he
        tells us dwelt no good thing: it was still sin or corrupt nature, and
        nothing but sin. In one point of view, then, Paul the Apostle could
        truly say that he was spiritual; in another, with equal truth, that he
        was carnal: literally and truly both spiritual and carnal. ‘The flesh
        lusted against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these
        were contrary the one to the other.’
      </p>
      <p>
        He was sold under sin as a child of the first Adam, and he delighted in
        the law of God as a child of the second Adam. Accordingly, through the
        whole of this passage to the end of the chapter, Paul describes himself
        as a twofold person, and points to two distinct natures operating within
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a universal truth respecting all believers. As Paul declares to
        the churches of Galatia, and, as in the passage before us, he affirms of
        himself, they cannot do the things that they would, Galatians 5:17. In
        the end of this chapter he asserts the same truth. So then with the mind
        — what he before called the inward man — I myself serve the law of God,
        but with the flesh — what remained of his corrupt nature, in which dwelt
        no good thing — the law of sin. — Sin was displaced from its dominion,
        but not from its indwelling. There was, then, in the Apostle Paul, as in
        every Christian, ‘as it were the company of two armies,’ Song of Solomon
        6:13. From this warfare, and these opposing principles within, no
        Christian in this world is ever exempt; and of this every one who knows
        the plague of his own heart is fully convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I
        not, but what I hate, that do I.
      </p>
      <p>
        For. — This verse explains and confirms the preceding. That which I do,
        I allow not. — Literally, I know not. The English word know, as well as
        the word in the original, is often used as implying recognition or
        acknowledgment. We are said not to know a person whom we do not choose
        to recognize. Paul committed sin, but he did not recognize or approve
        it. He disclaimed all friendly acquaintance with it. For what I would,
        that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. — Every man, regenerate or
        unregenerate, must be sensible of the truth of this, so far as it
        imports that he does what he knows to be wrong. As there is no
        regenerate man in whom this is not verified, it cannot be confined to
        the unregenerate. But as it is of the regenerate the Apostle is here
        speaking, — that is, as he is speaking of himself at the time of
        writing, — it is necessary to apply it here peculiarly to the
        regenerate. Besides, as it is said that he did what he hated, it must be
        here applied exclusively to the regenerate. Though an unregenerate man
        disapproves of evil, he cannot be said to hate sin. This is
        characteristic of the regenerate, and of such only: ‘Ye that love the
        Lord, hate evil,’ Psalm 97:10. It is characteristic of the Redeemer
        Himself: ‘Thou hast loved righteousness an hated iniquity,’ Hebrews 1:9.
        The following words are decisive on the subject: — ’The fear of the Lord
        is to hate evil,’ Proverbs 8:13. Some suppose that what the Apostle says
        in this verse is to the same purpose with the noted heathen confession,
        ‘Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor. ’ — ’ I see what is better
        and approve of it; I follow what is worse.’ But these propositions are
        not at all identical. The heathen confesses that he practices what he
        knows to be wrong, but his inconsistency arises from the love of the
        evil. Paul confesses that he does what is wrong, but declares that
        instead of loving the evil, he regards it with hatred and abhorrence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law
        that it is good.
      </p>
      <p>
        If then I do that which I world not. — Dr. Macknight translates ‘which I
        incline not. ’ But this is not according to fact. A man may do what his
        conscience disapproves, but in acting thus he does not thwart his
        inclination. Inclination is a tendency or bent in a particular
        direction, and the bent of every man is naturally to sin. Mr. Stuart
        translates the word ‘desire,’ but neither is this correct. Sin may be
        contrary to reason and conscience, but it is agreeable to desire. I
        consent unto the law that it is good. — When a regenerate man does what
        he hates, his own mind testifies his approval of the law that prohibits
        the sin which he has practiced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — Not then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
        in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the I here, Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart understand reason and
        conscience. But reason and conscience can in no sense be called a man’s
        self: In this way a murderer might affirm that it was not he who
        committed the crime, for no doubt his reason and conscience disapproved
        of the action. It is quite obvious that the reason why Paul says that it
        was not he but sin in him, is because, as he had just stated, that which
        he did he allowed not, for he did that which he would not. This implies
        more than reason and conscience. It was therefore sin that dwelt in him
        — the old man, his carnal nature, which not only existed and wrought in
        him, but had its abode in him, as it has in all those who are
        regenerated, and will have so long as they are in the body. It is not,
        then, to extenuate the evil of sin, or to furnish an excuse for it, that
        Paul says, It is no more I, but sin that dwelleth in me; but to show
        that, notwithstanding his seeing it to be evil, and hating it, the root
        still subsisted in him, and was chargeable upon him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not necessary to be able to point out metaphysically the way in
        which the truth that all sin is voluntary, harmonizes with Paul’s
        declaration, the good that I would I do not . Things may be consistent
        which the human mind cannot penetrate. We are to receive God’s testimony
        from the Apostle, and believe it on God’s authority; and every Christian
        knows, by painful experience, the truth of all that the Apostle asserts.
        ‘What here would strike any mind free of bias,’ says Mr. Frazer in his
        excellent exposition of this chapter, in his work On Sanctification,
        ‘is, that this (I) on the side of holiness against sin is the most
        prevailing, and what represents the true character of the man; and that
        sin which he distinguishes from this (I) is not the prevailing reigning
        power in the man here represented; as it is, however, in every
        unregenerate man. On this verse Calvin also has remarked, — ’This
        passage clearly proves Paul is disputing concerning none but the pious,
        who are now regenerated. For man, while he continues like himself,
        whatever his character may be, is justly considered to be vicious.’ No
        one can disclaim sin, as in this verse it is disclaimed, except the
        converted man; for who besides can conscientiously and intelligibly
        affirm, ‘Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
        me?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good
        thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is
        good I find not.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know. — This is a thing which Paul knew as an Apostle of the Lord
        Jesus Christ, and that he must have known by experience also. Who ever
        has a proper knowledge of himself will be convinced that naturally there
        is nothing good in him. What Paul knew was, that in him dwelt no good
        thing. This goes beyond what he had asserted in the end of the preceding
        verse. There he asserts that the evil which he did was caused by sin
        dwelling in him. Here he asserts not only that sin dwelt in him, but
        that no good thing dwelt in him. But how could he say so, if he was a
        regenerated man? If there was something in him which he calls himself,
        and which he would not allow to have any share in his sin, how can he
        say that there is in him no good thing? Is not this principle that hates
        the sin which he commits a good principle? Certainly it is. And to
        prevent such an inference from his words, he explains by a parenthesis
        the sense in which he asserts that no good thing dwelt in him. That is
        in my flesh. — He confines the assertion to his carnal nature. Nothing
        can more clearly and expressly show that this description is a
        description of the regenerate man.
      </p>
      <p>
        What has an unrenewed man but flesh? His very reason and conscience are
        defiled, Titus 1:15. To will is present with me; not how to perform that
        which is good I find not. — ’ That is,’ says Mr. Frazer, ‘to will what
        is good and holy: and thus it is with him habitually and ready with
        him.’ Mr. Stuart, in his Commentary, renders this, ‘For to will that
        which is good, is in my power; but to do it, I do not find (in my
        power).’ Yet in the text he translates it, ‘For to desire what is good,
        is easy for me; but to do it, I find difficult,’ which is an entirely
        different and contradictory idea. A thing that is very difficult may yet
        be performed. Dr. Macknight renders it, ‘Indeed, to incline lies nears
        me; but to work out what is excellent, I do not findNEAR ME,’ — giving
        no distinct sense, from an affectation of rendering literally, Calvin
        says ‘He (Paul) does not mean that he has nothing but an ineffectual
        volition and desire, but he asserts the efficacy of the work does not
        correspond to the will, because the flesh hinders him from exactly
        performing what he is engaged in executing.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I
        would not that I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the good that I would I do not. — This does not imply that he did
        not attempt, or in some sense perform, what he purposed, but that in all
        he came short. Calvin, in continuation of the last quotation from him,
        says, ‘What follows to do the end which he would not — must also be
        taken in the same sense, because the faithful are not only hindered from
        running speedily by their own flesh, but it also opposes many obstacles
        against which they stumble; and they do not, therefore, perform their
        duty, because they do not engage in it with becoming alacrity. The will,
        therefore, here mentioned, is the readiness of faith, while the Holy
        Spirit forces the pious to be prepared and zealous in employing their
        time to perform obedience to God. But Paul, because his power is unequal
        to the task, asserts that he does not find what he was wishing to attain
        — the accomplishment of his good desires.’ But the evil which I would
        not do, that I do. — So far from being unsuitable to the real character
        of a regenerate man, every regenerate man must be sensible from his own
        experience that this charge is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it,
        but sin that dwelleth in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a confirmation of what was asserted, verse 17, by alleging the
        reason on which the assertion is founded. It is not reason and
        conscience that Paul here declares to have no share in the evil; it is
        the will which he expressly mentions, and, whatever metaphysical
        difficulties it may involve, of the will it must be understood. The
        conclusion we ought to draw, is not to contradict the Apostle by denying
        that he speaks of the will, but that in one sense it is true that no sin
        is involuntary, and that, in another sense, what the Apostle here
        asserts is also an undoubted truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is
        present with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evil propensity of our nature the Apostle calls a law, because of
        its strength and permanence. It has the force of a law in corrupt
        nature. This proves that it is of himself, as to his present state, that
        the Apostle speaks. None but the regenerate man is properly sensible of
        this law. It does not refer to conscience, which in an unregenerate man
        will smite him when he does that which he knows to be wrong. It refers
        to the evil principle which counteracts him when he would do that which
        is right.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law is the greatest grievance to every Christian. It disturbs his
        happiness and peace more than any other cause. It constantly besets him,
        and, from its influence, his very prayers, instead of being in
        themselves worthy of God, need forgiveness, and can be accepted only
        through the mediation of Christ. It is strange that any Christian should
        even hesitate as to the character in which the Apostle uses this
        language. It entirely suits the Christian, and not in one solitary
        feature does it wear the feeblest semblance of any other character.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 22. — For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.</p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse Paul had said, I would do good; here he more
        fully expresses the same desire after conformity to the holy law. For I
        delight in the law of God. — This is decisive of the character in which
        the Apostle speaks. None but the regenerate delight in the law of God.
        Mr. Stuart, after the Arminian Whitby, and the Arian Taylor, has
        referred to a number of passages, in order to lower the import of this
        term. But they have no similarity to the present case. They are too
        numerous to be introduced and discussed in this place. Whoever wishes to
        examine them may consult Mr. Frazer’s work On Sanctification, in which
        they are most satisfactorily proved to be misapplied, and wrested to the
        perversion of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        To delight in the law of the Lord is characteristic of the regenerate
        man.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unregenerate man hates that law as far as he sees the extent of its
        demands to transcend his power of fulfillment. He is enmity against God,
        and is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, ch. 8:7.
        How, then, can he delight in it? After the inward man. — The inward man
        is a term used only by Paul, and in reference to those who are
        regenerated. It is the new or spiritual nature, not merely the reason
        and conscience. Than this nothing can be more obviously characteristic
        of the Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the evil of his corrupt nature, he is conscious of
        delighting in the law of God in its full extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — But I see another law in my members warring against the law
        of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in
        my members.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse the Apostle had spoken of the law of God in the
        inward man; here he speaks of another law in his members, warring
        against the law of his mind Thus he denominates his new and spiritual
        nature his ‘inward man’ and his ‘mind,’ and his old and carnal nature
        his ‘members.’ The bent of the Apostle’s mind, according to his renewed
        nature, inclined him to delight in the law of God. But he found an
        opposite bent in his corrupt nature, which he calls a law in his
        members. This he represents as warring against the other. Is not this
        the experience of every Christian? Is there not a constant struggle of
        the corruptions of the heart against the principle of holiness implanted
        by the Spirit of God in the new birth?
      </p>
      <p>
        And bringing me into captivity to the law of sin and death. — Mr. Stuart
        endeavors to aggravate this description in such a manner as to render it
        unsuitable to the regenerate man. He supposes that this represents the
        person as brought entirely and completely into captivity, which cannot
        be supposed of the regenerate. He refers to captives taken in war, who
        are entirely in the power of their conquerors, and are reduced to the
        most abject slavery. This is feeble reasoning. How far this captivity
        extends cannot be known from the figure. And, as a matter of fact, if
        the evil principle of our nature prevails in exciting one evil thought,
        it has taken us captive. So far it has conquered, and so far we are
        defeated and made prisoners. But this is quite consistent with the
        supposition that, on the whole, we may have the victory over sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body
        of this death?
      </p>
      <p>
        O wretched man that I am — This language is suitable only to the
        regenerate. An unregenerate man is indeed wretched, but he does not feel
        the wretchedness here expressed. He may be sensible of misery, and he
        may be filled with anxious fears and dreadful foreboding; but the person
        here described is wretched only from a sense of the evil principle which
        is in his members. Such a feeling no unregenerate man ever possessed. An
        unregenerate man may wish to be delivered from danger and punishment;
        but instead of wishing to be delivered from the law of his nature, he
        delights in that law. He has so much pleasure in indulging that law,
        that for its sake he risks all consequences. The body of this death. —
        Some understand this of his natural body, and suppose the exclamation to
        be a wish to die. But this would be a sentiment totally at variance with
        the principles of the Apostle, and unsuitable to the scope of the
        passage. It is evidently an expression of a wish to be free from that
        corrupt principle which caused him so much addiction. This he calls a
        body, as before he had called it his members. And he calls it a body of
        death because its demerit is death. It causes death and everlasting ruin
        to the world; and had it not been for the coming of the Lord Jesus
        Christ, it must have had the same consequences with respect to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the
        mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thank God. — Some suppose that this expresses thanks for the victory
        as already obtained. But this cannot be the meaning, as, in the same
        breath, the apostle speaks of his wretchedness because of the existence
        of the evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some, again, supposing that it refers to present deliverance, explain it
        to be the freedom from the law spoken of in the preceding part of the
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this would make the Apostle speak entirely away from the purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is discoursing of that corruption which he still experiences.
        Besides, the form of the expression requires that the deliverance should
        be supposed future, — who SHALL deliver me. I thank God through Jesus
        Christ. — The natural supplement is, He will deliver me. At death Paul
        was to be entirely freed from the evil of his nature. The consolation of
        the Christian against the corruption of his nature is, that although he
        shall not get free from it in this world, he shall hereafter be entirely
        delivered. So then. — This is the consequence which Paul draws, and the
        sum of all that he had said from the 14th verse. In one point of view he
        served the law of God, and in another the law of sin. Happy is the man
        who can thus, like Paul, with conscious sincerity say of himself, —
        ’With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law
        of sin.’ Here he divides himself, as it were, into two parts, — the mind
        by which he means his inward man, his renewed self; and the flesh, by
        which he designs his carnal nature, or the old man, that was sold under
        sin; and thus he accounts for his serving two different laws — the law
        of God written on his mind, and in the service of which he delighted as
        a regenerate man; and the law of sin by which he was sometimes carried
        captive. Beyond this no child of God can go while in this world; it will
        ever remain the character of the regenerate man. But this fully
        ascertains that Paul himself, in his predominant disposition and fixed
        purpose, serves God, although he is compelled to acknowledge that the
        power of the old man within him still subsists, and exerts itself; while
        it is his earnest desire daily to put him off, Ephesians 4:22, and to be
        transformed by the renewing of his mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        In every believer, and in no one else, there are these two principles, —
        sin and grace, flesh and spirit, the law of the members and the law of
        the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may be perverted by the opposer of Divine truth into a handle
        against the Gospel, and by the hypocrite to excuse his sin. But it gives
        ground to neither. It is the truth of God, and the experience of every
        Christian. If any man will pervert it to a wicked purpose, he shall bear
        his sin. We are not at liberty to pervert the word of God in order to
        preserve it from a contrary perversion. Many, no doubt, wrest the
        Scriptures to their own destruction. I serve. — Employing, as he does,
        through the whole of this passage, the present tense, Paul does not say,
        I have served, as referring to his state of unregenerate, but ‘I serve,’
        as respecting his present state as a believer in Christ, composed of
        flesh and spirit, which, as they are different principles, regard two
        different laws. It is further to be observed, that this last account
        which he gives of himself, and which agrees with all he had said before,
        and confirms the whole, is delivered by him, after he had, with so much
        faith and fervency, given thanks to God in view of his future and
        complete deliverance from sin. This, as Gill well remarks, is a
        conclusive argument and proof that he speaks of himself, in this whole
        discourse concerning indwelling sin, as a regenerated person.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if to render it altogether impossible to imagine that the Apostle was
        personating another man, he here, in conclusion, uses the expression I
        myself, which cannot, if language has a meaning, be applied to another
        person. It is a phrase which again and again he employs, — Romans 9:3; 2
        Corinthians 10:1, and 12:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the whole, then, we here learn that the Apostle Paul, notwithstanding
        all the grace with which he was favored, found a principle of evil
        operating so strongly in his heart, that he denominates it a law always
        present and always active to retard him in his course. He was not,
        however, under its dominion. He was in Christ Jesus a new creature, born
        of God, renewed in the spirit of his mind. He delighted in the holy law
        of God in all its extent and spirituality, while at the same time he
        felt the influence of the other hateful principle — that tendency to
        evil which characterizes the old man, — which waged perpetual war
        against the work of grace in his soul, impelling him to the commission
        of sin, and constantly striving to bring him under its power. Nothing
        can more clearly demonstrate the fallen state of man, and the entire
        corruption of his nature, than the perpetual and irreconcilable warfare
        which that corruption maintains in the hearts of all believers against
        ‘the Divine nature’ of which they are made partakers; and nothing can
        more forcibly enhance the value of the Gospel, and prove its necessity
        in order to salvation, or more fully illustrate the great truth which
        Paul had been illustrating, that by the deeds of the law no flesh shall
        be justified in the sight of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        When, in the hour and power of darkness, the prince of this world came
        to assault the Redeemer, he found nothing in Him — nothing on which his
        temptations could fix or make an impression; but how different was it
        when he assailed the Apostle Peter! Him he overcame, and to such an
        extent as to prevail on him to deny his Lord and Master, notwithstanding
        all the firmness and sincerity of his previous resolutions. Had not the
        Lord interposed to prevent his faith from entirely failing, Satan would
        have taken full possession of him, as he did of Judas. In the same way,
        it was only by grace that the Apostle Paul was what he was, 1
        Corinthians 15:10; and by that grace he was enabled to maintain the
        struggle against his old corrupt nature, until he could exclaim, in the
        triumphant language of victory, ‘I have fought a good fight, I have
        finished my course, I have kept the faith.’ ‘My grace,’ said Jesus to
        him, ‘is sufficient for thee; for My strength is made perfect in
        weakness.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole concluding part of this chapter is most violently perverted by
        Dr. Macknight, and Mr. Stuart, and Mr. Tholuck. In his explanation of
        this last verse, Dr. Macknight, by first converting the assertion it
        contains into a question, and then boldly adding to it, makes the
        Apostle say precisely the reverse of what he actually affirms. ‘Do I
        myself then as a slave, serve with the mind the law of God, but with the
        flesh the law of sin?BY NO MEANS.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Tholuck, after denying all along that the Apostle, in the conclusion
        of this chapter, describes his own experience, and affirming that he is
        speaking in the name of a legalist, arrives at the 25th verse, in the
        first clause of which, though not in the last, he judges that the
        Apostle must be speaking in his own person. ‘After the struggle of the
        legalist,’ he says, ‘with the wretchedness arising from his sense of
        inward schism has in this description been wrought up to the highest
        pitch, Paul comes forward to a sudden in his own person, and breaks
        forth in thankfulness to God for having delivered him by the redemption
        from that miserable condition.’ A more unfounded interpretation cannot
        be imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Tholuck considers the position in which, according to his view, Paul
        has thus placed himself to be so awkward, that he does not allow it to
        pass unnoticed. ‘As this sally of gratitude, however, interrupts,’ he
        adds, ‘the course of the argument, and is quite involuntary, inasmuch as
        Paul meant still to draw his inference from all that he had previously
        said, he finds himself compelled, in a way not the most appropriate,
        after the expression of his gratitude, still to append the conclusion,
        which is intended briefly and distinctly to show the state of the
        legalist.’ Can any Christian be satisfied with this manner of treating
        the Scriptures? Can any sober-minded man acquiesce in such an
        interpretation? This is a ‘sally of gratitude,’ and worse, it is
        -involuntary! Did Paul utter things\parINCOHERENTLY? He finds himself
        compelled in a way NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE, to append the conclusion.
        Is this a reverent manner of speaking of the dictate of the Holy Ghost?
        In the proper and obvious sense of the expression, as employed by the
        Apostle, it is most appropriate; yet Mr. Tholuck affixes to it a
        ludicrous import! f38 The warfare between the flesh and the spirit,
        described in this chapter, has greatly exercised the ingenuity of men
        not practically acquainted with its truth. Few are willing to believe
        that all mankind are naturally so bad as they are here represented, and
        it is fondly imagined that the best of men to much better than this
        description would prove them to be. Every effort of ingenuity has
        accordingly been resorted to, to divert the Apostle’s statements from
        the obvious conclusion to which they lead, and so to modify his doctrine
        as to make it worthy of acceptance by human wisdom. But they have
        labored in vain. Their theories not only contradict the Apostle’s
        doctrine, but are generally self-contradictory. Every Christian has in
        his own breast a commentary on the Apostle’s language.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there be anything of which he is fully assured, it is that Paul has
        in this passage described his experience; and the more the believer
        advances in knowledge and holiness, the more does he loathe himself, as
        by nature a child of that corruption which still so closely cleaves to
        him. So far is the feeling of the power of indwelling sin from being
        inconsistent with regeneration, that it must be experienced in
        proportion to the progress of sanctification. The more sensitive we are,
        the more do we feel pain; and the more our hearts are purified, the more
        painful to us will sin be. Men perceive themselves to be sinners in
        proportion as they have previously discovered the holiness of God and of
        His law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conflict here described by Paul, his deep conviction of sin
        consisting with delight in the law of God, and this agreement of heart
        with its holy precepts, are peculiar to those only who are regenerated
        by the Spirit of God. They who know the excellence of that law, and
        earnestly desire to obey it, will feel the force of the Apostle’s
        language. It results from the degree of sanctification to which he had
        attained, from his hatred of sin and profound humility. This conflict
        was the most painful of his trials, compelling him in bitterness to
        exclaim, ‘O wretched man that I am!’ — an exclamation never wrung from
        him by all his multiplied persecutions and outward sufferings. The proof
        that from the 14th verse to the end of the chapter he relates his own
        experience at the time when he wrote this Epistle, is full and complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the whole of this passage, instead of employing the past
        time, as he does from the 7th to the 14th verse, Paul uniformly adopts
        the present, while he speaks in the first person about forty times,
        without the smallest intimation that he is referring to any one else or
        to himself at any former period. His professed object, all along, is to
        show that the law can effect nothing for the salvation of a sinner,
        which he had proved to be the character of all men; and, by speaking in
        his own name, he shows that of this every one who is a partaker of His
        grace is in his best state convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end he triumphantly affirms that Christ will deliver him, while
        in the meantime he experiences this painful and unremitting warfare; and
        closes the whole by saying, ‘So then with the mind I myself serve the
        law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Can it be supposed that in saying, ‘I myself,’ the Apostle meant another
        man; or that, in using the present time, he refers to a former period?
        Of what value is language, if it can be so tortured as to admit of an
        interpretation at direct variance with its obvious meaning? To suppose
        that another, and not the Apostle himself, is here designed, is contrary
        to every principle of sound interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul, in this chapter, contrasts his former with his present state.
        Formerly, when ignorant of the true import of the law, he entertained a
        high opinion of himself. ‘I was alive without the law once.’ Accordingly
        he speaks in other parts of his writings of his sincerity, his religious
        zeal, and his irreproachable moral conduct before his conversion.
        Afterwards, when the veil of self-delusion was removed, he discovered
        that he had been a blasphemer, a persecutor, injurious, and in unbelief;
        so that, when he was an Apostle, he calls himself the chief of sinners.
        If he owns convinced that he had been a sinner, condemned by the law, it
        was when the Lord Jesus was revealed to him; for till then he was
        righteous in his own esteem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that time he was dead in trespasses and sins, having nothing but
        his original corrupted nature, which he calls sin. He had no conviction
        that he was radically and practically a sinner, of which the passage
        before us proves he was now fully conscious. From this period, the
        flesh, or sin, which he elsewhere calls ‘the old man,’ remained in him.
        Though it harassed him much, he did not walk according to it; but, being
        now in the spirit, the new nature which he had received predominated. He
        therefore clearly establishes, in this chapter, the opposition between
        the old man and the working of the new nature. This is according to the
        uniform language of his Epistles, as well as of the whole of Scripture,
        both in its doctrinal and historical parts. In consistency with this, he
        exhorts the saints at Ephesus to ‘put off the old man, which is corrupt
        according to the deceitful lusts;’ and calls on the faithful brethren at
        Colosse to mortify their members which are upon the earth. All his
        instructions to ‘them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus’ proceed on
        the same principle. And why were they cautioned by him even against the
        grossest sins, but because there was still in them a principle disposed
        to every sin?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three circumstances in this passage which are of themselves
        decisive of the fact that Paul here recounts his own present experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is, that the Apostle hates sin. He hates it, because it is
        rebellion against God, and the violation of His law. This no unconverted
        man does, or can do. He may dislike the evil effects of sin, and
        consequently wish that he had not committed it; but he does not, as the
        Apostle here declares of himself, hate sin. Hating sin is the
        counterpart of loving the law of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second circumstance in proof that the Apostle is here referring to
        the present time, is, that he delights in the law of God after the
        inward man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it is only when sin is dethroned, and grace reigns in the heart,
        that this can be a truth. ‘I delight,’ says the Psalmist, ‘to do Thy
        will, O my God; yea, Thy law is in my heart.’ ‘I will delight myself in
        Thy commandments, which I love,’ Psalm 40:8, <19B916> 119:16, 24, 35,
        47, 92, 97, 174. Delight in His law and the fear of God cannot be
        separated. The Holy Spirit pronounces such persons blessed. ‘Blessed is
        the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in His
        commandments,’ <19B201> Psalm 112:1. ‘Blessed is the man that walketh
        not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners,
        nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful; but his delight is in the law
        of the Lord, ’ Psalm 1:1. Thus the man that delights in the law of the
        Lord is blessed; and who will affirm that an unconverted man is blessed?
        Far from delighting in the law of God, which the first commandment
        enjoins, — ’Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,’ — ’the
        carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of
        God, neither indeed can be.’ Such is the state of every unconverted man.
        And if, as all Scripture testifies, enmity against God be the
        characteristic of the wicked, and delight in God and His law be the
        characteristic of a regenerate man, by what perversion of language, by
        what species of sophistry, can it be affirmed that the Apostle, while
        describing his inward delight in God, is to be regarded as portraying
        himself in his original unconverted state? So far was he, while in that
        state, from delighting in God, either inwardly or outwardly, that his
        carnal mind was enmity against Jehovah, and his zeal was manifested in
        persecuting the Lord of glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third circumstance which incontestably proves that Paul is here
        relating his present personal experience, is his declaration that he
        expects his deliverance from Jesus Christ. Is this the language of a man
        dead in trespasses and sins — of one who is a stranger to the truth as
        it is in Jesus, and to whom the things revealed by the Spirit of God are
        foolishness? 1 Corinthians 2:14. ‘No man,’ says Jesus, ‘can come to Me,
        except the Father, which hath sent Me, draw him,’ John 6:44. ‘No man can
        say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost,’ Corinthians 12:3.
        How, then, shall an unconverted man look to Him for deliverance?
      </p>
      <p>
        In another place already referred to, the Apostle describes the internal
        warfare experienced by Christians between the flesh and the spirit, or
        the old and new man, in language precisely similar to what he here
        employs concerning himself; ‘The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and
        the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the
        other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would,’ Galatians 5:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of his apostolic labors, where he is endeavoring to animate
        those to whom he wrote, Paul represents himself engaged as here in the
        same arduous struggle. ‘I keep under my body, and bring it into
        subjection, lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I
        myself should be a castaway,’ 1 Corinthians 9:27. Having there a
        different object in view, he refers to his success in the struggle;
        while, in the chapter before us, his design is to exhibit the power of
        the enemy with whom he has to contend. But in both cases he speaks of a
        severe contest with an enemy within, striving to bring him into
        captivity to sin and death. In another place, addressing those at
        Ephesus, whom he describes as ‘quickened together with Christ,’ and
        including himself, whilst speaking in the character of ‘an Apostle of
        Jesus Christ by the will of God,’ he uses the following unequivocal and
        energetic language — ’For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
        against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
        darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.’ He
        therefore calls on those to whom he wrote to ‘take the whole armor of
        God, that they may be able to withstand and to quench the fiery darts of
        the wicked one,’ Ephesians 6:12. Does not this describe a conflict
        equally severe as that in which, in the passage before us, he represents
        himself to be engaged? Does not this imply that evil existed in himself,
        as well as in those to whom he wrote, without which the fiery darts of
        the devil could have taken no more effect than on Him in whom the prince
        of this world when he came found ‘nothing’? And what is the purpose of
        the Christian armor, but to fit us to fight with flesh and blood,
        namely, our corruptions, as well as other enemies, against which Paul
        says, we wrestle?
      </p>
      <p>
        Was the Apostle Peter chargeable with the sin of dissimulation, and did
        the Apostle Paul experience no internal struggle with the old man which
        caused the fall of his fellow Apostle? Did Paul call upon other saints
        to put off the old man, and was there not in him an old man? Did he
        admonish all his brethren, without exception, to mortify their members
        which were upon the earth, and had he no sins to mortify? And why was it
        necessary for the Lord to send him a thorn in the Flesh, the messenger
        of Satan to buffet him, to curb the pride of his nature and prevent him
        from being exalted above measure, had it not been for the remaining
        corruption of his nature working powerfully in his heart, which from
        this it appears all his other severe trials and afflictions were
        insufficient to subdue? This alone determines the question. Was it not
        incumbent, too, on Paul, as on all other believers, to pray daily for
        the forgiveness of his sins? Was it not necessary for him, like David,
        to pray that his heart might be enlarged, that he might run the way of
        God’s commandments? <19B932> Psalm 119:32.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that Paul says in this chapter concerning himself and his inward
        corruption, entirely corresponds with what we are taught both in the Old
        Testament and the New respecting the people of God. The piety and
        devotedness to God of the holiest men did not prevent the evil that was
        in them from appearing in many parts of their conduct; while at the same
        time we are informed of the horror they expressed on account of their
        transgressions. God declares that there was no man like Job on the
        earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feared God and eschewed
        evil; and by God Himself Job is classed with two others of His most
        eminent saints, Ezekiel 14:14. Yet Job exclaims, ‘Behold, I am vile;
        what shall I answer Thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.’ ‘I have
        heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth Thee:
        wherefore I abhor myself in dust and ashes,’ Job 40:4, 42:5, 6. ‘My
        soul,’ says the Psalmist, in the same Psalm in which he so often asserts
        that he delights in the law of God, — ’my soul cleaveth unto the dust;’
        while in the preceding sentence he had declared, ‘Thy testimonies also
        are my delight:’ and again, ‘I will delight myself in Thy commandments,
        which I have loved;’ ‘O how I love Thy law! it is my meditation all the
        day;’ ‘My soul hath kept Thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly;’
        yet he says, ‘Mine iniquities are gone over my head as an heavy burden;
        they are too heavy for me. My wounds stink and are corrupt, because of
        my foolishness;’ ‘My loins are filled with a loathsome disease, and
        there is no soundness in my flesh;’ ‘My groaning is nothing from Thee;’
        ‘I will declare mine iniquity.’ Yet in the same Psalm David says, ‘In
        Thee, O Lord, do I hope.’ ‘They also that render evil for good are mine
        adversaries, because I follow the thing that is good. Make haste to help
        me, O Lord my salvation.’ ‘Iniquities,’ he says, ‘prevail against me,’
        while he rejoices in the forgiveness of his sins. ‘Pardon mine iniquity,
        for it is great.’ ‘Woe is me,’ exclaims the Prophet Isaiah, ‘for I am a
        man of unclean lips,’ Isaiah 6:5. ‘Who can say, I have made my heart
        clean, I am pure from my sin?’ Proverbs 20:9. God promised to establish
        an everlasting covenant with Israel, Ezekiel 16:63; and the consequence
        was to be, that they should loathe themselves and be confounded when God
        was pacified towards them. The complaints of the servants of God all
        proceeded from the same source, namely, their humiliating experience of
        indwelling sin, at the same time that, after the inward man, they
        delighted in the law of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And could it be otherwise in men who, by the Spirit of God, were
        convinced of sin? John 16:8. There is not a man on earth that delights
        in the law of God who does not know that his soul cleaveth unto the
        dust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparing himself with the law of God, Paul might well lament his
        remaining corruption, as the Apostle Peter, experiencing the same
        consciousness of his sinfulness, exclaims, ‘Depart from me, for I am a
        sinful man, O Lord;’ or as the Apostle James confesses, ‘In many things
        we all offend.’ Both Peter and James here declare that they themselves,
        although Apostles of Christ, had sin in them. Was then Paul an exception
        to this? and if he had sin, is it not a just account of it, when he says
        that there was a law within him warring against the law of his mind; in
        short, a contest between what he elsewhere calls the new and the old
        man? If, on the other hand, on account of anything done either by him or
        in him, of any zeal, excellency, or attainment, Paul, or any man, should
        fancy himself in a state of sinless perfection, the Holy Ghost, by the
        mouth of the Apostle John, charges him with self-deception. ‘If we’
        (Apostle or others) ‘say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
        the truth is not in us,’ 1 John 1:8. Whence, then, is there any
        difficulty in admitting that in the account of the internal struggle in
        the passage before us, Paul described his own warfare with indwelling
        sin, or that it portrays a state of mind incompatible with that of an
        Apostle? Did Paul’s sanctification differ in kind from that of other
        believers, so as to render this incredible, or, in as far as it may have
        exceeded that of most other believers, did it differ only in degree?
        There is then no ground whatever for denying that he here related his
        own personal experience, according to the plain literal, and obvious
        import of the expressions he employs. Were Paul, when judged at the
        tribunal of God, to take his stand on the best action he ever performed
        in the midst of his apostolic labors, he would be condemned forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imperfection would be found to cleave to the very best of his services;
        and imperfection, even in the least possible degree, as it respects the
        law of God, is sin. ‘Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
        things that are written in the book of the law to do them.’ And who is
        the mere man that, since the fall, came up for one moment to the
        standard of this holy law, which says, ‘Thou shalt love the Lord with
        all thy heart?’
      </p>
      <p>
        It was on a ground very different from that of his own obedience, that
        Paul, when about to depart from the world, joyfully exclaimed,
        ‘Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the
        Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that day.’ Yes, it will be a
        crown of righteousness, because Christ, having been made of God unto him
        ‘wisdom,’ Paul had renounced his own righteousness, that so being found
        in Him he might possess ‘the righteousness which is of God by faith.’ He
        was therefore covered with the robe of righteousness, even the
        righteousness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, — Jehovah our
        righteousness, — who is the end of the law for righteousness to every
        one that believeth. And thus, in the judgment of strict justice, Paul,
        with all believers, notwithstanding all his and their sins and
        shortcomings, shall be pronounced ‘righteous,’ — a character twice given
        to those who shall appear on the right hand of the throne, Matthew
        25:37-6, — in that day when the ‘righteous servant’ of Jehovah shall
        judge the world in righteousness. Thus, too, when the great multitude of
        those who have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb shall stand
        before the throne, the full import of the words of Paul, with which in
        the fifth chapter of this Epistle he closes the account of the entrance
        of sin and death, and of righteousness and life, will be made gloriously
        manifest. ‘That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace
        reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.’
        That great truth, which Paul has also declared will then be fully
        verified, that the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, because
        therein is the righteousness of God revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        With carnality, then — the corruption of his nature — Paul the Apostle
        was chargeable; and of this, at all times after his conversion, he was
        fully sensible. Conscious that he had never for one moment attained to
        the perfection of obedience to the law of God, and knowing, by the
        teaching of the Spirit of God, that there was a depth of wickedness in
        his heart which he never could fathom, — for who but God can know the
        heart, which ‘is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked’?
        Jeremiah 17:9, — well might he designate himself a ‘wretched man,’ and
        turn with more earnestness than ever to his blessed Lord to be delivered
        from such a body of death. With what holy indignation would he have
        spurned from him such perverse glosses as are put upon his words to
        explain away their obvious import, by men who profess to believe the
        doctrines, and to understand the principles, which form the basis of all
        he was commissioned by his Divine Master to proclaim to the fallen
        children of Adam. He would have warned them not to think of him above
        that which is written, 1 Corinthians 4:6. And most assuredly they who
        cannot persuade themselves that the confessions and lamentations in the
        passage before us, strong as they undoubtedly are, could possibly be
        applicable to the Apostle Paul, do think of him above what is declared
        in every part of the word of God to be the character of every renewed
        man while he remains in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Mr. Toplady’s works it is stated that some of Dr. Doddridge’s last
        words were, ‘The best prayer I ever offered up in my life deserves
        damnation.’ In this sentiment Dr. Doddridge did not in the smallest
        degree exceed the truth. And with equal truth Mr. Toplady says of
        himself, ‘Oh that ever such a wretch as I should be tempted to think
        highly of himself! I that am of myself nothing but sin and weakness. In
        whose flesh naturally dwells no good thing; I who deserve damnation for
        the best work I ever performed,’ vol. 4:171, and 1-41. These are the
        matured opinions concerning themselves of men who had been taught by the
        same Spirit as the Apostle Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every man who knows ‘the plague of his own heart,’ whatever may be the
        view he has taken of this passage, knows for certain that even if the
        Apostle Paul has not given here an account of his own experience at the
        time when he wrote this Epistle such was actually the Apostle’s
        experience day by day. He also knows that the man who is not daily
        constrained to cry out to himself, ‘O wretched man that I am,’ from a
        sense of his indwelling corruption and his shortcomings, is not a
        Christian. He has not been convinced of sin by the spirit of God; he is
        not one of those who, like the Apostle Paul, are forced to confess, ‘We
        that are in this tabernacle do groan,’ 2 Corinthians 5:2,4; or to say,
        ‘We ourselves also which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we
        ourselves, groan within ourselves,’ Romans 8:23. The Apostle’s
        exclamation in the passage before us, ‘O wretched man that I am,’ is no
        other than this groaning. And every regenerate man, the more he is
        convinced of sin, which in his natural state never disturbed his
        thoughts, the more he advances in the course of holiness, and the more
        nearly he approaches to the image of his Divine Master, the more deeply
        will he groan under the more vivid conception and the stronger
        abhorrence of the malignity of his indwelling sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easy to see how suitable it was that the author of this Epistle
        should detail his own experience, and thus describe the internal
        workings of his heart, and not merely refer to his external conduct. He
        speaks of himself, that it might not be supposed that the miserable
        condition he described did not concern believers; and to prove that the
        most holy ought to humble themselves before God, since God would find in
        them a body of sin and death; guilty, as in themselves, of eternal
        death. Nothing, then, could serve more fully to illustrate his doctrine
        in the preceding part of it, respecting human depravity and guilt, and
        the universality of the inveterate malady of sin, than to show that it
        was capable, even in himself, with all the grace of which he was so
        distinguished a subject, of opposing with such force the principles of
        the new life in his soul. In this view, the passage before us perfectly
        accords with the Apostle’s design in this chapter, in which, for the
        comfort of believers, he is testifying that by their marriage with
        Christ they are dead to the law, as he had taught in the preceding
        chapter that by union with Him in His death and resurrection they are
        dead to sin, which amounts to the same thing. As, in the concluding part
        of that chapter, he had shown by his exhortations to duty, that, by
        affirming that they were dead to sin he did not mean that they were
        exempt from its commission, so, in the concluding part of this chapter,
        he shows, by detailing his own experience, that he did not mean that by
        their being dead to the law they were exempt from its violation. In one
        word, while, by both of these expressions, dead to sin, and dead to the
        law, he intended to teach that their justification was complete, he
        proves, by what he says in the concluding parts of both chapters, that
        their sanctification was incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as, referring to himself personally, he proves the incompleteness of
        the sanctification of believers, by looking forward to a future period
        of deliverance, saying, ‘Who shall deliver me? ‘so, referring to himself
        personally in the beginning of the 2nd verse of the next chapter, he
        proves the completeness of their justification by speaking of his
        deliverance in respect to it as past, saying, ‘The law of the Spirit of
        life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The view which the Apostle here gives of his own experience clearly
        demonstrates that the pain experienced by believers in their internal
        conflicts is quite compatible with the blessed and consolatory assurance
        of eternal Life. This he also proves in those passages above quoted,
        <470501> Corinthians 5:1, ‘We know that if our earthly house of this
        tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made
        with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this (tabernacle) we groan,
        earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which is from
        heaven.’ And in chapter 8:23, where he says, ‘Ourselves also which have
        the first fruits of the Spirit; even we ourselves groan within
        ourselves.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It was, then, to confirm the faith of the disciples, and furnish a
        living exhibition of their spiritual conflict, that Paul here lays open
        his own heart, and discloses the working of those two warring
        principles, which to a greater or less extent contend for the mastery in
        the bosom of every child of God. Every perversion, then, of this highly
        important part of the Divine testimony ought to be most strenuously
        opposed. It is not an insulated passage; it contains the clear
        development of a great general principle which belongs to the whole of
        Divine revelation, and is essential to its truth, — a principle of the
        utmost importance in Christian experience. ‘Blessed be God,’ says Mr.
        Romaine, ‘for the seventh chapter of the Romans.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The wisdom discovered in making the present experience of Paul the
        object of contemplation, ought to awaken in our hearts feelings of the
        liveliest gratitude. Had we been presented with a spectacle of the
        internal feelings of one less eminently holy, the effect would have been
        greatly weakened. But when this Apostle, whose life was spent in
        laboring for the glory of God; when he, whose blameless conduct was such
        as to confound his enemies who sought occasion against him; when he, who
        finished his course with joy, having fought a good fight, and kept the
        faith; when he, whose conscience enabled him to look back with
        satisfaction on the past, and forward with joy to the future; when he,
        who stood ready to receive the crown of righteousness which, by the eye
        of faith, he beheld laid up for him in heaven, — when one so favored, so
        distinguished, as the great Apostle of the Gentiles, is himself
        constrained, in turning his eye inward upon the rebellious strivings of
        his old nature, to cry out, ‘O wretched man that I am!’ — what a
        wonderful exhibition do we behold of the malignity of that sin, which
        has so deeply poisoned and corrupted our original nature, that death
        itself is needful in order to sever its chains and destroy its power in
        the soul!
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage, then, is peculiarly fitted to comfort those who are
        oppressed with a sense of indwelling sin in the midst of their spiritual
        conflicts, unknown to all except themselves and the Searcher of hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be some believers, who, not having examined it with sufficient
        care, or being misled by false interpretations, mistake its natural and
        obvious meaning, and fear to apply the words which it contains to Paul
        as an Apostle. When these shall have viewed this portion of the Divine
        word in its true light, they will bless God for the instruction and
        consolation it is calculated to afford; while the whole of the
        representation, under this aspect, will appear foolishness to all who
        are Christians only in name, and who never experienced in themselves
        that internal conflict which the Apostle here describes. It is a
        conflict from which not one of the people of God, since the fall of the
        first man, was ever exempted, — a conflict which He alone never
        experienced who is called ‘the Son of the Highest,’ of whom,
        notwithstanding, it has of late been impiously affirmed that He also was
        subjected to it.
