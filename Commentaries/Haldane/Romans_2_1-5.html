      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        IN the preceding chapter, the Apostle had described the state of the
        idolatrous Pagans, whom he had proved to be under the just condemnation
        of God. He now passes to that of the Jews, who, while they rejected the
        righteousness of God, to which the law and the prophets bore witness,
        looked for salvation from their relation to Abraham, from their
        exclusive privileges as a nation, and from their observance of the law.
        In this and the two following chapters, Paul combats these deeply-rooted
        prejudices, and is thus furnished with an opportunity of clearly
        unfolding the doctrine of the Gospel, and of proving that it alone is
        the power of God unto salvation. In the first part of this chapter, to
        the 24th verse he shows that the just judgment of God must be the same
        against the Jews as against the Gentiles, since the Jews are equally
        sinners. In the second part, from the beginning of the 25th verse to the
        end, he proves that the external advantages which the Jews had enjoyed,
        were insufficient to ward off this judgment. From his language at the
        commencement of this chapter, in respect to that judgment which the Jews
        were accustomed to pass on the other nations, and to which he reverts in
        the 17th verse, it is evident that through the whole of it he is
        addressing the Jews, and not referring, as many suppose, to the heathen
        philosophers or magistrates It was not the Apostle’s object to convince
        them in particular that they were sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, neither the philosophers nor magistrates, nor any of the
        heathens, occupied themselves in judging others respecting their
        religious worship and ceremonies. Such observances, as well as their
        moral effects on those by whom they were practiced, appeared to the
        sages of Greece and Rome a matter of perfect indifference. The Jews, on
        the contrary, had learned from their law, to judge, to condemn, and to
        abhor all other religions; to keep themselves at the greatest distance
        from those who profess them; and to regard all idolaters as under the
        wrath of God. The man, then, who judges others — to whom, by a figure of
        speech, Paul addresses his discourse in the first verse — is the same to
        whom he continues to speak in the rest of the chapter, and whom he names
        in the 17th verse, ‘Behold, thou art called a Jew.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
        judges: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for
        thou that judgest doest the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore. — This particle introduces a conclusion, not from anything in
        the preceding chapter, but to establish a truth from what follows. The
        Apostle had proved the guilt of the Gentiles, who, since they had a
        revelation vouchsafed to them in the works of God, though they did not
        possess His word, were inexcusable. The Jews, who had His word, yet
        practiced the same things for which the former were condemned, must
        therefore also be inexcusable. In the sequel, he specifies and unfolds
        the charge thus generally preferred. O Man. — This is a manner of
        address betokening his earnestness, which Paul frequently employs, as in
        the ninth chapter of this Epistle. Whosoever thou art that judgest. —
        The Apostle here refers to the judgment which the Jews passed on the
        Gentiles. It is generally explained as if he was finding fault with
        those whom he addressed, and declaring they were inexcusable, because
        they judged others. But this is erroneous.
      </p>
      <p>
        What he censures, is not their judging, but their doing the same things
        with those whom they condemned. The character of the Jews, which
        distinguished them from the Gentiles, was that they judged others. God
        had conferred on them this distinction, when He manifested His covenant
        to them, to the exclusion of all the other nations of the world. This
        character of judging, then, can belong only to the Jews, who, according
        to a principle of their religion, condemned the other nations of the
        earth, and regarded them as strangers from the covenants of promise,
        having no hope, and without God in the world. In this manner the Jews
        were seated as on a tribunal, from which they pronounced judgment on all
        other men. Paul, then, had good reason for apostrophizing the Jew as
        thou that judgest. But as there were also distinctions among the Jews
        themselves, and as the priests, the scribes, and chiefly the Pharisees,
        were regarded as more holy than others, he says, whosoever thou art, —
        thus not excepting even one of them. Thou art inexcusable. — Paul
        intended to bring in all men guilty before God, as appears by what he
        says in the 19th verse of the third chapter, ‘that every mouth may be
        stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.’ He had already
        proved the inexcusableness of the Gentiles, and he here proceeds to do
        the same respecting the Jews, whom he addresses directly, and not in a
        manner only implying that he refers to them, as is supposed by
        Professors Tholuck and Stuart. Mr. Stuart, especially, endeavors to show
        that in the first part of this chapter Paul does not proceed at once to
        address the Jews, ‘but first,’ he says, ‘prepares the way, by
        illustrating and enforcing the general proposition, that all who have a
        knowledge of what is right, and approve of it, but yet sin against it,
        are guilty.’ This view of the passage is equally erroneous with that of
        those who suppose that the Apostle is addressing the philosophers and
        magistrates. Both these interpretations lead away from the true meaning
        of the several parts of the chapter, through the whole of which the
        address to the Jew is direct and exclusive. The Apostle’s object was to
        conduct men to the grace of the Gospel, and so to be justified in the
        way of pardon and acquaintance. Now, in order to this, their conviction
        of sin and of their ruined condition was absolutely necessary, since
        they never would have recourse to mercy, if they did not feel compelled
        to confess themselves condemned. It is with this view that he here
        proceeds to strip the Jews, as he had done the Gentiles, of all excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself — Wherein,
        that is, in the thing in which thou condemnest another, thou condemnest
        thyself. Dr. Macknight translates it whilst. But though the words in the
        original thus translated often in certain situations bear this
        signification, here this cannot be the case. When there is nothing in
        the context to fix the reference, the most general substantive must be
        chosen. There is nothing in the context to suggest the idea of time, and
        thing is a more general idea. It is indeed true that the
        self-condemnation of the Jew is contemporaneous with his condemnation of
        the Gentile. But it is so, because this is implied in the very thing
        that is alleged, and the thing alleged is more important than the time
        in which it occurs. Nothing, then, is gained by thus deviating from the
        common version. The translation, because that, which is suggested by
        Professors Tholuck and Stuart as a possible meaning, is also to be
        rejected. To suggest a great variety of possible meanings has the worst
        tendency; instead of serving the truth, it essentially injures it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, as has been remarked, the cause of the condemnation of the Jew
        was not his judging the Gentiles: the cause of his condemnation was his
        doing the things which he condemned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasoning of the Apostle is clear and convincing. It consists of
        three particulars, on which the Jew had nothing to object, namely, — 1st
        , Thou judgest another; 2nd , Thou doest the same things; 3rd , Thou
        condemnest thyself; consequently thou art without excuse. Thou judgest
        another. — That is to say, Thou holdest the Gentiles to be criminal and
        guilty before God; thou regardest them as people whom God has abandoned
        to themselves, and who, therefore, being plunged in vice and sin of all
        kinds, are the objects of His just vengeance. This is what the Jew could
        not deny. Thou doest the same things. — This the Apostle was to prove in
        the sequel. Thou condemnest thyself: — The consequence is unavoidable;
        for the same evidence that convicts the Gentiles in the judgment of the
        Jew, must, if found in him, also bring him in guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
        against them which commit such things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul proceeds here to preclude a thought that might present itself, and
        to stifle it as it were, before its birth. It might be suggested that
        the judgment of God — that is, the sentence of condemnation with respect
        to transgressors — is not uniform; that He condemns some and acquits
        others, as it pleases Him; and therefore, although the Jew does the same
        things as the Gentile, it does not follow that he will be held equally
        culpable, — God having extended indulgence to the one, which He has not
        vouchsafed to the other. The Jew, then, does not hold himself guilty
        when he condemns the Gentile, although he does the same things. This is
        the odious and perverse imagination which the Apostle here repels. We
        are sure, or more literally, we know. Who knows? ‘Koppe,’ says Mr.
        Tholuck, ‘deems that there is here an allusion to the Jews, who boasted
        that they alone possessed the true knowledge.’ But this is palpably
        erroneous, because the Jews in general did not believe the thing
        asserted to be known. The Apostle’s object is to correct their error.
        Mr. Tholuck himself is still farther astray when he understands it of
        ‘those apprehensions of a Divine judgment which are spread among all
        mankind, to which the Apostle had alluded, ch. 1:32.’ It was the Apostle
        himself, and those taught by the same Spirit, who knew with unfaltering
        assurance the thing referred to. The judgment of God, — that is,
        sentence of condemnation, — not, as Dr. Macknight says, the curse of the
        law of Moses. The law of Moses and its curse are different from the
        sentence which God pronounces according to them. According to truth,
        against them which commit such things. — Not truly . This would qualify
        the assertion that the judgment of God is against such persons, which,
        as a general truth, neither the Jew nor the Gentile is supposed to
        question. In this sense, truly would express the same as really. Nor
        does it signify according to truth, as synonymous with justice, as Mr.
        Tholuck supposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        About the justice of the thing there is no question. If the Gentile is
        justly condemned for every breach of the law written on the heart, the
        justice of the condemnation of the transgressing Jew could not be a
        question. Nor, with Mr. Stuart, is it to be understood as meaning,
        agreeably to the real state of things, — that is, according to the real
        character of the person judged. This is doubtless a truth, but not the
        truth asserted in this passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meaning applies to the judgment that examines and distinguishes
        between the righteous and the wicked. But the judgment here spoken of,
        is the sentence of condemnation with respect to transgressors. Nor, with
        Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight, are we to understand this phrase as signifying, ‘according to
        the true meaning of God’s covenant with the fathers of the Jewish
        nation.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not expressed in the text, nor is it suggested by the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real import of this phrase will be ascertained in considering the
        chief error of the Jews about this matter. While they admitted that
        God’s law, in general, condemns all its transgressors, yet they hoped
        that, as the children of Abraham, God would in their case relax the
        vigor of His requirements. What the Apostle asserts, then, is designed
        to explode this error. If God should sentence Gentiles to condemnation
        for transgression of the work of the law written in the heart, and pass
        a different sentence on Jews transgressing the law of Moses, His
        judgment or sentence would not be according to truth. If some
        transgressors escaped, while others were punished, the truth of the
        threat or penalty was destroyed. The truth of God in His threatening, or
        in the penalty of the breach of His law, is not affected by the
        deliverance of those saved by the Gospel. The penalty and the precept
        are fulfilled in Jesus Christ the surety. While God pardons, He by no
        means clears the guilty. His people are absolved, because they are
        righteous; they have fulfilled the law, and suffered its penalty, in the
        death and obedience of Jesus Christ, with whom they are one. The object
        of the Apostle, then, was to undeceive the Jew in their vain hope of
        escape, while they knew themselves to be transgressors. And it equally
        applies to nominal Christians. It is the most prevalent ground of hope
        among false professors of Christianity, that God will not be so strict
        with them as His general threatening declares, because of their relation
        to Him as His professed people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
        things and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinkest thou. — This question evidently implies that the Jews did think
        they would escape, while they committed the very sins for which they
        believed the heathens would be condemned. This affords a key to the
        meaning of the foregoing phrase, according to truth, which implies the
        contrary of this, namely, that all will be punished according to the
        truth of the threatening or penalty. Escape. — This expression imports
        three things: first, that the Jew could not avoid being judged; second,
        that he could not avoid being condemned; and third, that he could not
        prevent the execution of the sentence that God will pronounce. We may
        decline the jurisdiction of men, or even, when condemned by them, escape
        from their hands, and elude the execution of their sentence; but all
        must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; all must be judged
        according to their works; and all who are not written in the book of
        life shall be cast into the lake of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may here observe how prone men are to abuse, to their own
        destruction, those external advantages which God bestows on them. God
        had separated the Jews from the Gentiles, to manifest Himself unto them;
        and, by doing so, He had exalted them above the rest of the world, to
        whom He had not vouchsafed the same favor. The proper and legitimate use
        of this superiority would have been to distinguish themselves from the
        Gentiles by a holy life. But instead of this, owing to a fatal
        confidence which they placed in this advantage, they committed the same
        sins as the Gentiles, and plunged into the same excesses. By this means,
        what they considered as an advantage became a snare to them; for wherein
        they judged others, they condemned themselves. We may likewise remark
        how much self-love blinds and betrays men into false judgments. When all
        the question was respecting the Gentiles, the Jews judged correctly, and
        conformably to Divine justice; but when the question is respecting
        themselves, although they were equal in guilt, they would not admit that
        they were equally the subjects of condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance,
        and long suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
        repentance?
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodness. — This is the best translation of the word. Mr. Tholuck says
        that it signifies love in general. But the idea expressed is more
        general than love. An object of goodness may be very unworthy of being
        an object of love. A distinction must be made between goodness,
        forbearance, and long-suffering. Goodness imports the benefits which God
        hath bestowed on the Jews. Forbearance denotes God’s bearing with them,
        without immediately executing vengeance — His delaying to punish them.
        It signifies the toleration which He had exercised towards them after
        extending to them His goodness; so that this term implies their
        ingratitude after having received the benefits which God had bestowed,
        notwithstanding which He had continued the course of His goodness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long-suffering signifies the extent of that forbearance during many
        ages, denoting a degree of patience still unexhausted. Their sins were
        not immediately visited with the Divine displeasure, as would be the
        case in the government of men. The term goodness respects their first
        calling, which was purely gratuitous, Deuteronomy 7:7. Forbearance
        respects what had passed after their calling, when, on different
        occasions, the people having offended God, He had, notwithstanding,
        restrained His wrath, and had not consumed them. It is this that David
        celebrates in <19A310> Psalm 103:10, and 106. Long-suffering adds
        something more to forbearance; for it respects a long course of
        ingratitude and sins on the part of that people, and imports an extreme
        degree of patience on the part of God, — a patience which many ages, and
        a vast accumulation of offenses, had not exhausted. The Apostle calls
        all this the riches of His goodness, and long-suffering, and
        forbearance, to mark the greatness of their extent, their value and
        abundance, and to excite admiration in beholding a God all-powerful, who
        has no need of any of His creatures, and is infinitely exalted above
        them, striving for so long a period with an unrighteous, ungrateful,
        rebellious, and stiff-necked people, but striving with them by His
        goodness and patience. This language is also introduced to correct the
        false judgments of men on this patience of God; for they are apt, on
        this account, to imagine that there is no God. If, say they, God
        existed, He would not endure the wicked. They suppose that God does not
        exercise His providence in the government of the world, since He does
        not immediately punish their sins. To repress these impious thoughts,
        the Apostle holds forth this manner of God’s procedure as the riches of
        goodness and patience, in order that the impunity which it appears that
        sinners enjoy, might not be attributed to any wrong principle. Or
        despisest thou. — God’s goodness is despised when it is not improved as
        a means to lead men to repentance, but, on the contrary, serves to
        harden them, from the supposition that God entirely overlooks their sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews despised that goodness; for the greatest contempt that could be
        shown to it was to shut the ear against its voice, and to continue in
        sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is acting as if it were imagined that the justice which lingers in
        its execution has no existence, and that it consists solely in empty
        threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interrogations of the Apostle in this and the preceding verse add
        much force to his discourse. Thinkest thou, says he, that thou canst
        avoid the judgment of God? By this he marks the erroneousness and folly
        of such a thought. Despisest thou the riches of His goodness? This is
        added to indicate the greatness of the crime. Not knowing. — There is no
        necessity, with Professors Tholuck and Stuart, to translate this ‘not
        acknowledging.’ The thing itself the Jews did not know, and the bulk of
        those called Christians are equally ignorant of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole of the Old Testament was sufficiently clear on this point, but
        the Jews excluded the light it furnished. They did so by the
        presumptuous opinion they entertained of their own external
        righteousness, in which they made the essence of holiness to consist,
        imagining that by it they would obtain acceptance with God. They
        likewise did so by the confidence they placed in the promises that God
        had made to Abraham and his posterity, flattering themselves with the
        vain thought that these promises acquired for them a right of impunity
        in their sins. And, finally, they did so by the gross error into which
        they had fallen, that the sacrifices and other legal expiations were
        sufficient to procure the pardon of their sins. By reason of these
        delusive prejudices they remained in their state of corruption, and did
        not penetrate farther into the design of God, who, by lavishing on them
        so much goodness, loudly called them to repentance. Leadeth thee to
        repentance. — It has been already remarked that the Apostle said nothing
        like this when speaking in the first chapter respecting the Gentiles. He
        did not ascribe to God either goodness, or forbearance, or
        long-suffering in regard to them. He did not say that God invited, or
        called, or led them to repentance. This shows, as has also been
        observed, that in the dispensation of providence which regarded them,
        there was no revelation of mercy. But if there was none for the
        Gentiles, it was otherwise with the Jews. The Old Testament contained in
        substance all the promises of the Gospel, as well as the temporal
        covenant which God had made with the Jews, which was a figure and type
        of the spiritual covenant made in Christ; and even all the rigors of the
        law indirectly conducted the Jews to the grace of God, and consequently
        called them to repentance. This call was all along accompanied among
        some of them by the spirit of sanctification, as appears by the example
        of the prophets and others. But with respect to the greater number, it
        remained unaccompanied with that spirit, and consequently continued to
        be merely an external calling, without any saving effect. The Apostle,
        in the following verse, declares that the Jews by their impenitence drew
        down upon themselves the just anger of God. From this it evidently
        follows that God externally calls many to whom He has not purposed to
        give the grace of conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also follows that it cannot be said that when God thus externally
        calls persons on whom it is not His purpose to bestow grace, His object
        is only to render them inexcusable. For if that were the case, the
        Apostle would not have spoken of the riches of His goodness, and
        forbearance, and long-suffering, — terms which would not be applicable,
        if, by such a call, it was intended merely to render men inexcusable.
      </p>

        Ver. 5. — But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up
        unto thyself wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.

      <p>
        The Apostle here intimates that the contempt which the Jews had evinced
        of the Divine calling could not remain unpunished. Thy hardness. — This
        is a figurative expression, and strongly expresses the natural obduracy
        and insensibility of their hearts with respect to God, as impenetrable
        by the strongest external force. Nothing but the power of the Spirit of
        God can overcome it. It is the term which Moses often employs to express
        the obstinacy of Pharaoh. He also employs it to mark the corruption of
        the Israelites; and, in general, the Prophets use it to signify the
        inflexible perversity of sinners. It is in this sense that Ezekiel
        attributes to man a heart of stone, — a heart which does not feel, and
        which nothing in man himself can soften. These passages, and many
        similar ones, denote an inclination to wickedness so strong and so
        rooted, that it has entire possession of the man and of all the powers
        of the soul, without his being able to undeceive himself, and to turn to
        God. It is this also which is marked by the expression impenitent heart;
        for it does not refer merely to the act of impenitence, and to the heart
        being in that state at present, but to the fact of its being so enslaved
        to sin, that it never would or could repent. Dr. Macknight, while he
        admits that the word literally signifies ‘cannot repent,’ most
        erroneously adds, ‘here it signifies, which does not repent.’ The
        greatness of this obduracy was made manifest by the number and force of
        the external invitations which God had employed to lead the Jews to
        repentance, and which the Apostle calls His goodness, forbearance, and
        long-suffering; for these invitations refer to the frequent and earnest
        exhortations of His word, His temporal favors, the afflictions and the
        chastisements He had sent, and all His other dispensations towards the
        Jewish people, respecting which it is said, ‘What could have been done
        more to My vineyard that I have not done in it?’ Isaiah 5:4; and again,
        ‘I have spread out My hands all the day unto a rebellious people,’
        Isaiah 65:2. When men remain inflexible under such calls, it is the
        indication of an awful obduracy, of a heart steeled and shut up in
        impenitence. Such was the state of the Jews. This passage is explicit in
        opposition to all who suppose that God employs nothing for men’s
        conversion but the efficacy of His word, accompanied with other
        circumstances calculated to make an impression on their minds. Without
        the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit, these will always prove
        ineffectual. Thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath. — This is a strong
        expression, and a beautiful figure. It proves that sins will be punished
        according to their accumulation. A man is rich according to his
        treasures. The wicked will be punished according to the number and
        aggravation of their sins. Dr.

      <p>
        Macknight makes the whole beauty and energy of the expression to
        evaporate, when he explains it as comprehending the thing referred to by
        an Hebraistic extension of meaning. There are two treasures, which Paul
        opposes to each other, — that of goodness, of forbearance, and
        long-suffering, — and that of wrath; and the one may be compared to the
        other. The one provides and amasses blessings for the creature, the
        other punishments; the one invites to heaven, the other precipitates to
        hell; the one looks on sin to pardon it on repentance, the other regards
        obstinate continuance to punish it, and avenge favors that are despised.
        God alone prepares the first, but man himself the second; and on this
        account the Apostle says, ‘Thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath.’ He
        had just before ascribed to the Jew a hard and impenitent heart, —
        expressions which, as we have seen, signify an entire and settled
        inclination to evil, a corruption which nothing in man can overcome. He
        adds, that by this means he treasures up wrath. This is very far, then,
        from countenancing the opinion of those who say that if men were
        absolutely and entirely unable to convert themselves, they would be
        excusable, and that God could not justly require of them repentance.
        Such is not the doctrine of the Apostle Paul, which, on the contrary,
        teaches that the more a man is hardened in crime, the more he becomes an
        object of Divine justice and wrath. The reason is, that this want of
        power has its seat in the will itself, and in the heart, and that it
        consists in an extreme degree of wickedness and perversity, for which
        there can be no excuse. Against the day of wrath and revelation of the
        righteous judgment of God. — That is, the day of the last judgment,
        which is called the day of wrath, because then the wrath of God will
        display itself upon the wicked without measure. Till that day the
        judgments of heavenly justice remain, as it were, concealed and covered
        under the veil of Divine patience; and till then the sins of men are
        treasured up as in a heap, and punishment is awaiting them. But on that
        day, the coming of which is plainly declared in the Scriptures, but
        which will then be actually revealed, a deluge of wrath will descend
        upon the wicked. It is called the day of the righteous judgment of God,
        namely, of the display of His strict justice; for judgment will then be
        laid to the plummet, and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
        and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place. It will therefore be the
        day of the execution of the justice of God; for it is in its execution
        that it will be fully made manifeSt. When the Apostle speaks here of the
        day of wrath, and of God’s righteous judgment, he refers to the judgment
        of those who are under the law. There is no judgment of God which is not
        according to strict justice; there is none that is a judgment of mercy.
        Mercy and justice are irreconcilable except in Christ, in whom mercy is
        exercised consistently with justice. There is no judgment that admits
        repentance and amendment of life as satisfactory to justice. Repentance
        and amendment are not admitted to stand in the room of righteousness. It
        is a truth to which there is no exception, either with respect to God or
        man, that righteous judgment admits no mercy. The acquittal of the
        believer in that day will be as just as the condemnation of the sinner.
        It will be the day in which God, by Jesus Christ, will judge the world
        in righteousness, according to the strict rules of justice, Acts 17:31,
        in which none will be acquitted except those whom the Lord, in His
        representation of the judgment, calls the ‘righteous,’ Matthew 25:37-46;
        and He calls them righteous because they are really so in Christ Jesus.
        But the judgment to which the Apostle here refers, which he
        characterizes as the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
        judgment of God, is that of the execution of unmingled wrath upon the
        wicked. He is not speaking of believers who are in Christ, but of those
        who are under the law, before which nothing but perfect and personal
        conformity to all its demands can subsist; ‘for as many as are of the
        works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every
        one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of
        the law to do them.’ All the sins of such persons will be punished, but
        especially those of obstinacy and contempt which shall have been shown
        towards the goodness and patience of God; for what the Apostle is here
        aiming at, is to convince the Jews that it is to that judgment those
        will be remitted who reject the grace manifested to them.
