      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        PAUL was fully aware that the doctrine of the sovereignty of God in the
        rejection of the Jews and the preaching of salvation to the Gentiles,
        would greatly offend his countrymen. He accordingly begins this chapter
        with an acknowledgment of their sincerity as actuated by a zeal of God;
        but before prosecuting the subject of God’s sovereignty further, he more
        particularly recurs to their unbelief, to which in the preceding chapter
        he had already alluded. This leads him to remark the contrast between
        the righteousness of the law and the righteousness of faith. He next
        insists on the free invitations of the Gospel, which proclaims salvation
        to all of every nation who believe, and from this takes occasion to
        point out the necessity of preaching it to the Gentiles. The Gentiles,
        as he had before proved, were among the children of the promise made to
        Abraham, and it was only by means of the Gospel that they could be
        brought to the knowledge of Christ, through which alone the promise to
        them could be fulfilled. This duty, notwithstanding the objections of
        the Jews, he therefore urges, and enforces it by referring to the
        Scriptures, while he answers the objection, that the Gospel had not been
        generally received. In the last place, he proves, by the testimony of
        the Prophets, that the rejection of Israel and the in gathering of the
        Gentiles had been long before predicted, and concludes the chapter by
        showing that the Jews had both heard and rejected the gracious and long
        continued invitations to reconciliation with God. In the whole of this
        chapter, Paul treats in a practical way what in the preceding one he had
        chiefly referred to the sovereignty of God, to which he afterwards
        revert.
      </p>
      <p>
        We here see a beautiful example in Paul of the meekness and gentleness
        of the Lord Jesus Christ, who prayed for His murderers. The Jews
        considered Paul as one of their greatest enemies. They had persecuted
        him from city to city, again and again they had attempted his life, and
        had succeeded in depriving him of his liberty, yet his affection for
        them was not diminished. He prayed for them, he accommodated himself to
        their prejudices as far as his obedience to God permitted, and thus he
        labored by all means to save some. He here assures those to whom he
        writes of his cordial good will towards Israel, and of his prayers to
        God that they might be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
        that they might be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brethren. — Those here addressed are the brethren in Christ to whom Paul
        wrote, and not the Jews in general, who were his brethren in the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no doubt but by apostrophe he might address the unbelieving
        Jews; but there is nothing like an apostrophe here, nor is there any
        need of such a supposition. Whoever was addressed, the sentiment would
        be equally well understood by the unbelieving Jews who should read or
        hear the Epistle. My heart’s desire and prayer to God. — It is of great
        importance to remove prejudices as far as possible, and to show good
        will to those whom we wish to benefit by the publication of Divine
        truth. We see here the love of a Christian to his bitterest enemies.
        Paul was abused, reviled, and persecuted by his countrymen, yet he not
        only forgave them, but constantly prayed for their conversion.
        Unbelievers often accuse Christians, though very falsely, as haters of
        mankind, because they faithfully declare that there is no salvation but
        through faith in Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we should especially remark, that while the salvation of his
        countrymen was the desire of Paul’s heart, and while he was endeavoring
        in every way possible to call their attention to the Gospel, he did not
        neglect to offer up prayer for them to God. Other means, as we have
        opportunity, should not be left untried; but prayer is at all times in
        our power, and in this we should ever persevere. When we are shut out
        from access to man, we have always access to God, and with Him is the
        residue of the Spirit. In this duty, we learn from the Epistles that
        Paul was ever much engaged for his brethren in Christ, and here we see
        that he did not neglect it in behalf of those by whom he was hated and
        persecuted. He thus obeyed the injunctions, and imitated the example, of
        our blessed Lord. In this verse, too, standing in connection with what
        immediately precedes it, we learn that Paul’s faithful annunciation of
        these doctrines, which by so many are most erroneously considered as
        harsh towards men, and unfavorable to the character of God, so far from
        being opposed to feelings of the warmest affection for others, is
        closely and intimately conjoined with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should never cease to pray for, and to use all proper means for the
        conversion of, those who either oppose the Gospel with violence, or from
        some preconceived opinion. Secret things belong to God, and none can
        tell whether or not they are among the number of the elect. No one among
        the Jews was more opposed to the Gospel than Paul himself had been; and
        every Christian who knows his own heart, and who recollects the state of
        his mind before his conversion, should consider the repugnance he once
        felt to the doctrine of grace. We ought not, indeed, to treat those as
        Christians who do not appear to be such. This would be directly opposed
        to the dictates of charity, and would tend to lull them into a false
        security.
      </p>
      <p>
        But assuredly none can have such powerful inducements to exercise
        patience towards any who reject the Gospel, as they who know who it is
        that has made them to differ from others, and that by the grace of God
        they are what they are. These considerations have a direct tendency to
        make them humble and gentle. Those who are elected shall indeed be
        finally saved, but this will-take place through the means which God has
        appointed. It is on this ground that Paul says, ‘Therefore I endure all
        things for the elect’s sake, that they may also obtain the salvation
        which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — For I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not
        according to knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul acknowledged that the Jews had a zeal of God, and so far he
        approved of them, and was on that account the more interested in their
        behalf. This had formerly been the case with himself, Acts 26:9;
        Galatians 1:14. Their zeal, however, and the sincerity of their
        attachment to their system, was no excuse for their unbelief. The
        Apostle had sorrow for their condemnation, not hope of their salvation
        on account of their sincerity and zeal. This is an important lesson to
        thousands who profess Christianity. How often is it said that if a man
        be sincere in his belief, his creed is of no great importance. His
        salvation, it is supposed, is not endangered by his ignorance or error.
        How far on this head does the Apostle Paul differ from those who thus
        judge, while his love to mankind cannot be doubted. His love to his
        countrymen appears to have exceeded anything to which the persons
        alluded to can pretend. Yet he bewails the Jews as under condemnation on
        account of their ignorance. We see here that men may attend to religion,
        and be much occupied on the subject, without being acceptable to God;
        and that sincerity in error is neither a means of salvation nor an
        excuse for any man. Nothing but the natural alienation of their minds
        from God prevents those who possess the Scriptures from understanding
        the way of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going
        about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
        themselves unto the righteousness of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ground of rejection of the Gospel by the Jews was their ignorance of
        God’s righteousness. Had they understood this, they would have ceased to
        go about to establish their own righteousness; but not understanding
        that righteousness which God has provided in His Son, they rejected the
        salvation of the Gospel. Mr. Stuart translates the word rendered
        righteousness throughout this passage by the word justification, which
        is warranted by no authority. Dr. Macknight, who, like Mr. Stuart,
        denies the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, says that the
        righteousness here spoken of is ‘the righteousness which God appointed
        at the fall, as the righteousness of sinners,’ which he explains
        elsewhere to mean faith, saying that God ‘hath declared that He will
        accept and reward it as righteousness.’ Dr. Campbell of Aberdeen, as has
        been formerly noticed, explains the righteousness here spoken of as that
        ‘purer scheme of morality which was truly of God,’ opposed to the
        ‘system of morality or righteousness fabricated by the Jews.’ In this
        manner do these writers, though each in a different way, make void all
        that is said throughout this Epistle and elsewhere in the Scriptures on
        that most important expression, ‘the righteousness of God,’ through the
        revelation of which the Apostle declares that the Gospel ‘is the power
        of God unto salvation,’ Romans 1:17. The righteousness of God. — That
        is, the righteousness provided by God and revealed in the Gospel, which
        is received by faith, by which men are saved; and he who does not submit
        to this righteousness, and humbly receive it, but supposes that he can
        do something to give him a right to obtain or to merit it, or who
        attempts to add to it anything of his own, or to substitute in its place
        his own obedience, more or less, is equally ignorant of the corruption
        of his own heart, of the holiness of God, and of the perfection of the
        obedience which the law requires. In this verse the fatal error is
        clearly expressed of those who expect to be saved by any works of their
        own, even when, like the Pharisee who prayed in the temple, they ascribe
        to God all that they suppose to be good in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
        one that believeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here declares what he means by the righteousness of God, to
        which the Jews would not submit, namely, the fulfillment, object, and
        consummation of the law by our Lord Jesus Christ. The end of the law. —
        What the end of the law is, Paul shows, Romans 7:10, when he says, It
        was ordained to life, namely, that the man who doeth all that it
        commands, should live by it. And what is it that, in the present state
        of human nature, the law cannot do? It cannot justify, and so give life,
        because it has been broken. How then did God act? He sent His Son in the
        likeness of sinful flesh, and condemned sin in the flesh. And why has He
        done this? The answer is given, ch. 8:4, ‘that the righteousness of the
        law might be fulfilled in us’ who are in Him. Thus it is, that Christ is
        the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. By Him
        is accomplished for all such the whole purpose and object of the law —
        all its demands being fulfilled, and the end for which it was given
        attained. Christ thus redeems His people from its curse, and procures
        for them the blessing of life, which, under the righteous government of
        God, He confers on all His creatures who are conformed to His holy law.
        The fallen angels possessed life while they retained their obedience,
        and Adam, while he held fast His integrity; but this was not the full
        end of the law, for they apostatized. In them, therefore, the law fell
        short of attaining its end. But the righteousness imputed to those who
        believe in Christ is ‘everlasting righteousness,’ Daniel 9:24, and
        therefore to them belongs eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their life is comprised in His life, and He is ‘that eternal life;’ and
        ‘when He who is their life shall appear, they shall appear with Him in
        glory.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, Jesus says, ‘I am come that they might have life, and that
        they might have it more abundantly.’ ‘I have finished,’ said our blessed
        Lord in His intercessory prayer to His Father, ‘the work which Thou
        gavest Me to do;’ and on the cross, just before He expired, He said, It
        is finished. In each of these passages The word rendered finished is the
        same as that which is here translated end, signifying accomplished,
        consummated, or perfected. In the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:1, the same
        original word is rendered ‘perfection.’ The Apostle there says, ‘Let us
        go on to perfection’ — to the end or finishing, meaning the consummation
        or completion of all that the law required, which he shows was found in
        the sacrifice and work of Jesus Christ. This perfection — this end — was
        not attained by the Levitical priesthood; for if ‘perfection were by the
        Levitical priesthood, what further need was there that another Priest
        should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the
        order of Aaron?’ Hebrews 7:11. Nor was it attained by the legal
        dispensation, which ‘made nothing perfect,’ ver. 19, — brought nothing
        to its end or consummation. This was found only in Christ, ‘for by one
        offering He hath perfected for ever (still the same word in the original
        in all these places) them that are sanctified,’ Hebrews 10:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that Christ was the perfection or the end of the law, is the
        great object of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which furnishes a complete
        commentary on the passage before us. That Epistle opens with declaring
        Jesus Christ to be the Son of God. To prove and to establish this grand
        truth, as the foundation of all that the Apostle was afterwards to
        advance, was essential to his purpose. For by no one in the whole
        universe, excepting by Him who is infinite, could the eternal or
        everlasting righteousness predicted by Daniel have been brought in. It
        was, then, this important truth, that Christ is the end of the law for
        righteousness to every one that believeth, which Paul labors in that
        Epistle to impress on the minds of the Jewish converts, for the
        confirmation of their faith; and it was the ignorance of this same
        important truth in the great body of the nation, which in the chapter
        before us he laments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unbelieving Jews vainly went about to establish their own
        righteousness by their obedience to the law, instead of viewing it as a
        schoolmaster to lead them unto, or until, the coming of Christ, by whom
        alone it could be and was fulfilled, Matthew 5:18. This verifies what
        the Apostle says, 2 Corinthians 3:13, that ‘the children of Israel could
        not look steadfastly to the end’ (the same word as in the verse before
        us) ‘of that which is abolished.’ Christ, then, as is declared in this
        verse, is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
        believeth. For the moment that a man believes in Him, the end of the law
        is attained in that man; that is, it is fulfilled in him, and he is in
        possession of that righteousness which the law requires, or ever can
        require, and consequently he hath eternal life, John 6:54, to which the
        law was ordained, Romans 7:10. Christ, then, by His obedience has
        fulfilled the law of God in every form in which men have been under it,
        that His obedience or righteousness might be imputed as their
        righteousness to all who believe, ‘He hath made Him to be sin for us,
        who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him,’
        2 Corinthians 5:21. ‘Surely, shall one say, In the Lord have I
        righteousness,’ Isaiah 45:24. ‘He shall be called Jehovah our
        righteousness,’ Jeremiah 23:6. This is the only righteousness in which a
        man can stand before God in judgment, and which shall be acknowledged in
        the great day. They, and they only, who, by their works proceeding from
        that faith which unites the soul to Christ, and which receives this
        righteousness, are proved to possess it, shall then be pronounced
        ‘righteous,’ Matthew 25:37,46. This righteousness is imputed to every
        one that believeth, and to such only. This makes it clear that Jesus
        Christ has not fulfilled the law for mankind in general, but for those
        in particular who should believe in His name, John 17:9,20. His
        atonement and intercession are of the same extent, and are presented for
        the same individuals. ‘I pray not for the world, but for them which Thou
        hast given Me.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart, in his explanation of this 4th verse, introduces the
        following quotation from Flatt: — ‘Christ is the te>lov no>mou (end of
        the law) in respect to dikaiosu >nh (righteousness), He has brought it
        about, that we should not be judged after the strictness of the law. He
        has removed the sentence of condemnation from all those who receive the
        Gospel.’ To this Mr. Stuart adds — ’Well and truly.’ That the sentence
        of condemnation is removed from all who receive the Gospel, although in
        a very different way from what Mr. Stuart supposes, is most certain. But
        no sentiment can be more unscriptural than that we shall not be judged
        after the strictness of the law. For what saith the Scripture? ‘He hath
        appointed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness.’ In
        that day, instead of men not being judged after the strictness of the
        law, judgment will be laid to the line, and righteousness to the
        plummet, and all those in whom the righteousness of the law has not been
        fulfilled in all its demands, without the defalcation of one jot or
        tittle, will be found under its curse, and that awful sentence will be
        pronounced on them, ‘Depart from Me, ye cursed.’ The judgment, in
        accordance with every representation of it contained in Scripture, and
        with the whole plan of salvation, will be conducted in all respects,
        both as to those who shall be saved and those who shall be condemned,
        after the strictness of both law and justice. Under the righteous
        government of God, never was one sin committed which will not be
        punished either in the person of him who committed it, or in that of the
        Divine Surety of the new covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
        That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This illustrates what the Apostle had just before said, that Christ, and
        Christ alone, has fulfilled the demands of the law, and therefore in
        vain shall life be sought by any man’s personal obedience to its
        commandments. To live by the law requires, as Moses had declared, that
        the law be perfectly obeyed. But this to fallen man is impossible. The
        law knows no mercy; it knows no mitigation, it overlooks not even the
        smallest breach, or the smallest deficiency. One guilty thought or
        desire would condemn for ever. Whoever, then, looks for life by the law,
        must keep the whole law in thought, word, and deed, and not be
        chargeable with the smallest transgression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
        Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven (that is, to bring
        Christ down from above:) Ver. 7. — Or, Who shall descend into the deep?
        (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) Ver. 8. — But what
        saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart;
        that is, the word of faith which we preach; We should rather expect
        contrast in every point of view than coincidence between the law given
        by Moses and the Gospel of Christ. Can there then be any illustration of
        the receiving of righteousness by faith, which is here the Apostle’s
        subject, and the precepts that were given to the Israelites as a shadow
        of the Gospel? Doubtless, with all the difference between the law and
        the Gospel, there must be a point of view in which they are coincident,
        for in such a view it is that he chiefly makes his quotation. Paul
        alleges the passage to which he refers, Deuteronomy 30:11-14, as in a
        certain respect speaking the language of the righteousness of faith. The
        language used by Moses described the clearness of the manner of giving
        the knowledge of the Divine requirements to the people of Israel. But
        though this was its original object, yet it had a further reference to
        the clearness of the manner of revealing the Gospel. For the Apostle
        explains it, ‘That is, to bring Christ down from above.’ The language,
        then, that describes the clearness of the revelation of the precepts of
        God to Israel, was a figure of the clearness of the revelation of the
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses gave the Israelites a law which was to abide with them for their
        constant instruction. They were not obliged to send a messenger to
        heaven to learn how they were to serve God, nor to search out wisdom by
        their own understanding. Nor had they to send over the sea to distant
        countries, like the heathens, for instruction. God by Moses taught them
        everything with respect to His worship and service in the fullest,
        clearest, and most practical manner. This was a shadow of the clearness
        of the revelation of the righteousness received by faith, which we are
        not left to search for by means through which it never can be obtained.
        Salvation is brought nigh to us, being proclaimed in the Gospel by the
        death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The word is in our mouth. We
        receive the righteousness He has brought, not by any efforts of our own
        in seeking salvation, and laboring to keep the law of God, but by the
        belief of that word which was published at Jerusalem, announcing
        salvation to the guiltiest of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel is contained in figure in every part of the law. The very
        manner of giving the law was a shadow of the Gospel, and typified
        salvation through a great Mediator. And though the New Testament often
        contrasts the demands of the law with the voice of mercy speaking in the
        Gospel, yet here the Gospel also speaks through the law. The reference
        to what Moses observed with respect to the precepts which he delivered
        from God to Israel, instead of finding an opposition to the plan of
        salvation through Christ, finds an illustration which Divine wisdom had
        prepared to shadow it, in the mission of the Mediator under the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wonderful is the wisdom of God manifested in the harmony of the Old and
        New Testaments. They who do not understand it, have labored to show a
        coincidence merely by accommodation. But the Spirit of God everywhere
        explains the language of the Old Testament, as in its design appointed
        by God to be a shadow of things of Christ’s kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        But though there is a coincidence, there is also a contrast between the
        law and the Gospel. While the language of the law is, ‘Do and live,’
        that righteousness which it demands, and which man is unable to perform,
        is, according to the Gospel, gratuitously communicated through faith.
        This righteousness is in Christ, and He is not at a distance, so that we
        must scale the heavens, or descend below the earth, — in one word,
        attempt what is impracticable, to come to Him, and derive from Him this
        benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        He and this righteousness are brought near unto us, as was long before
        predicted. ‘Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from
        righteousness: I bring near My righteousness; it shall not be far off,
        and My salvation shall not tarry,’ Isaiah 46:12. All men, till
        enlightened by the Spirit of God, seek salvation by doing something of
        which they imagine God will approve. If it is not complete, His mercy,
        they suppose, will still incline Him to accept of it for value; but
        without something of his own to present, man in his natural state never
        thinks of approaching God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing can be more self-evidently false than that man can merit from
        God. Yet, notwithstanding the folly of this supposition, it is only the
        energy of the Holy Spirit through the truth of the Gospel that will
        convince him of the fallacy. Even the very Gospel of the grace of God is
        seen through this false medium; and while men exclaim, ‘Grace, grace,’
        they continue to introduce a species of merit by putting Christ at a
        distance, and making access to Him a matter of time and difficulty. How
        different is the Gospel, as here exhibited by Paul!
      </p>
      <p>
        We must not attempt in any way to merit Christ, or to bring anything
        like an equivalent in our hand. The language of Scripture is, ‘Ho, every
        one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters: and he that hath no money;
        come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and
        without price.’ ‘He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the
        rich’ — they who are worthy in their own esteem, whose that they may
        find acceptance, bring something of their own — ’He hath sent empty
        away.’ ‘Say not,’ observes Archbishop Leighton, ‘unless I find some
        measure of sanctification, what right have I to apply Him (Christ) as my
        righteousness? This inverts the order, and prejudges thee of both. Thou
        must first, without finding, yea, or seeking anything in thyself but
        misery and guiltiness, lay hold on Him as thy righteousness; or else
        thou shalt never find sanctification by any other endeavor or pursuit.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
        shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead,
        thou shalt be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth. — The confession of Christ is
        salvation. But that confession which is salvation, is a confession which
        implies that the truth confessed with the mouth is known and received in
        the heart. The belief of the heart is therefore joined with the
        confession of the lips. Neither is genuine without the other, though it
        may be said that either the one or the other is salvation, because they
        who believe with the heart will confess with the tongue. If a man says,
        ‘I believe in Christ,’ yet denies Him when put to trial, or confesses
        Him with the lips, yet denies Him in His proper character, he neither
        confesses nor believes Christ. It should always be remembered, that if
        he believes anything different from the testimony of God relating to the
        person and work of the Savior, he does not believe the Gospel, but
        something, whatever it may be, which can neither sanctify nor save. The
        Gospel alone is the power of God unto salvation to every one who
        believes it. Hath raised Him from the dead — Why is so much stress laid
        on the resurrection? Was not the work of Christ in this world finished
        by His death? Most certainly it was. But His resurrection was the
        evidence that it was finished; and therefore the belief of His
        resurrection is put for that of the whole of His work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emphasis of the second person throughout this verse should be
        remarked. The Apostle does not speak indefinitely, but he says
        emphatically, If thou shalt confess with thy mouth, and shalt believe in
        thine heart, thou shalt be saved. He speaks of every one, so that all
        may examine themselves, for to every one believing and confessing,
        salvation is promised; thus teaching each one to apply the promise of
        salvation to himself by faith and confession. Thus the Apostle shows
        that every believer has as much certain assurance of his salvation as he
        certainly confesses Christ with his mouth, and as he believes in his
        heart, that the Lord Jesus was raised from the dead. Our assurance of
        salvation corresponds with the measure of our faith, and the boldness of
        our confession of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
        the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believeth unto righteousness. — That is, unto the receiving of
        righteousness, namely, the righteousness of Christ. This righteousness
        is called ‘the righteousness of faith,’ Romans 4:13 — not that it is in
        the faith, but it is so called as being received by faith, as it is
        said, Romans 3:22, ‘the righteousness which is by faith,’ and
        Philippians 3:9, ‘the righteousness which is of God by faith.’ Faith,
        then, is only the appointed medium or means of our union with Christ,
        through which we receive this righteousness, and not the righteousness
        itself. ‘Faith,’ says the Westminster Confession, ‘justifies a sinner in
        the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always
        accompany it; or of good works that are the fruits of it; nor as if the
        grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his
        justification; but only as it is an instrument, by which he receiveth
        and applieth Christ’s righteousness.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression, ‘Faith is counted to him for righteousness,’ Romans 4:3,
        is often supposed to mean, ‘is counted to him instead of, or as
        righteousness;’ but, as has been remarked on that text, p. 162, the
        literal rendering is not for righteousness, but unto righteousness, in
        conformity with the proper translation as in the verse before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faith of the Gospel is not a speculation, it is not such a knowledge
        of religion as may be acquired like human science. This may often have
        the appearance of true faith; but it is not ‘the substance of things
        hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.’ Many things connected with
        the Gospel may be believed by the natural man, and each of the doctrines
        taken separately may be in some way received by him, as notions of
        lights and colors are received by the blind. But the Gospel is never
        understood and believed, except by those who, according to the promise,
        are ‘taught of the Lord,’ Isaiah 54:13; who therefore know the Father
        and Him whom He hath sent, which is eternal life, John 17:3. In the
        parable of the sower, where only the fourth description of persons are
        represented as having truly and permanently received the word, they are
        characterized as understanding it, and they only bear fruit; the others
        understood it not, Matthew 13:19-23. ‘The natural man receiveth not the
        things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither
        can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned,’ 1 Corinthians
        2:14. It is impossible that a man can believe that to be the word of God
        which he regards as foolishness ‘No man can say’ (understanding and
        believing what he says) ‘that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost,’
        1 Corinthians 12:3. When Peter answered and said, ‘Thou art the Christ,
        the Son of the living God,’ ‘Blessed,’ said Jesus, ‘art thou, Simon
        Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but My
        Father which is in heaven,’ Matthew 16:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justifying faith is the belief of the testimony of Christ, and trust in
        Him who is the subject of that testimony. It is believing with the
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning those who received a good report through faith, it is
        declared that they saw or understood the promises; they were persuaded
        of their truth, and they embraced them, taking them home personally, and
        resting upon them. On the passage before us, Calvin remarks, ‘The seat
        of faith, it deserves to be observed, is not in the brain, but the
        heart; not that I wish to enter into any dispute concerning the part of
        the body which is the seat of faith, but since the word heart generally
        means a serious, sincere, ardent affection, I am desirous to show the
        confidence of faith to be a firm, efficacious, and operative principle
        in all the emotions and feelings of the soul, not a mere naked notion of
        the head.’ And with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. — A man
        becomes righteous, perfectly righteous, through believing God’s record
        concerning His Son. But the evidence that this faith is genuine is found
        in the open confession of the Lord with the mouth in everything in which
        His will is known. Confession of Christ is as necessary as faith in Him,
        but necessary for a different purpose. Faith is necessary to obtain the
        gift of righteousness. Confession is necessary to prove that this gift
        is received. If a man does not confess Christ at the hazard of life,
        character, property, liberty, and everything dear to him, he has not the
        faith of Christ. In saying, then, that confession is made unto
        salvation, the Apostle does not mean that it is the cause of salvation,
        or that without it the title to salvation is incomplete. When a man
        believes in his heart, he is justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        But confession of Christ is the effect of faith, and will be evidence of
        it at the last day. Faith which interests the sinner in the
        righteousness of Christ is manifested by the confession of His name in
        the midst of enemies, or in the face of danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — For the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on Him shall not
        be ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Scripture saith . — Here Paul shows that the Scriptures of the
        Prophets taught the same doctrine that he was teaching. This was not
        necessary in order to add authority to his own doctrine, — for he was
        equally inspired with the Prophets, — but in order to prove the perfect
        agreement of the Old and the New Testament, and to show that the Jews
        who denied that the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs with them, were in
        error, even on their own principles. By this reference to the
        Scriptures, too, the Apostle in the first place confirms the truth he
        had been so forcibly declaring concerning the language of the
        righteousness by faith, namely, that it was not necessary to make some
        impracticable attempts such as to ascend into heaven, or to descend into
        the deep — to come to Christ, since He was brought nigh to all in the
        preaching of the Gospel, which proclaimed that whosoever shall call on
        the name of the Lord shall be saved. And, in the next place, it afforded
        him an opportunity of recurring to the important truth, brought into
        view in the preceding chapter, of the Gentiles being fellow-heirs of
        that righteousness, such of them as believed the promises being part of
        the spiritual seed of Abraham, and equally interested in those promises
        with the believing remnant of the Jews. The natural and easy way in
        which Paul thus reverts to this subject, and connects it with his
        declarations concerning the perversion of the truth of God by the
        unbelieving part of the Jewish nation, in seeking to establish their own
        righteousness, and not submitting themselves to the righteousness of
        God, ought to be particularly remarked; as well as its opening the way
        for exhibiting the duty of preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles, and
        showing that, in respect to the manner in which they must be saved,
        there is no difference between them and the Jews. Whosoever believeth on
        Him. — This language of the Prophet extended mercy to the Gentiles, if
        they believed. Here it may be remarked, that the least degree of faith
        embraces Christ, and unites the soul to Him. Faith does not save us by
        being strong or weak. It is Jesus Christ by whom we are saved and not by
        our faith, which is only the instrument or hand by which we receive Him.
        It may be further remarked, that here, as in so many other parts of
        Scripture, we see a full warrant for every one of the human race to
        believe in Jesus Christ, with the certainty that in doing so he shall be
        saved. Some, however, may be disposed to say, ‘We are not humbled, or at
        least humbled enough for our sins, and therefore we dare not place
        confidence in Christ for His salvation.’ Such persons ought to know that
        true humiliation is a concomitant or a consequence of saving faith, but
        is not a ground of it. It gives a man no right to trust in Christ, — no
        title to Divine acceptance either of his person or of his performances.
        It is indeed, in the hand of the Spirit, a means of rendering a man
        willing to trust in the Lord Jesus, and the more of it he attains, he is
        the more willing; but it affords him no degree of warrant to trust in
        Him, — nor is it requisite it should; for by the invitations and calls
        of the Gospel he already is fully warranted, so well warranted, that
        nothing in himself can either diminish or increase his warrant. When any
        one, therefore, says that he dare not trust in the Redeemer, because he
        is not sufficiently humbled, he thereby shows that he is under the
        prevalence both of unbelief and of a legal spirit: of unbelief, — for he
        does not believe that by the calls and commands of God he is
        sufficiently warranted to rely on Christ, but that something more is
        requisite to afford him a sufficient warrant; of a legal spirit, — for
        he regards humiliation as that which must confer upon him a right to
        trust in Christ, since for want of it in a sufficient degree, he dare
        not intrust his salvation to Him. But he may be assured that he cannot
        obtain holy consolation till he come as he is, and place direct
        confidence in Jesus Christ for all his salvation; and that he cannot
        have true evangelical humiliation till he first trust in Christ for it,
        and so receive it by faith Out of His fullness. The more of this
        humiliation he attains, the more willing will he be to come as a sinner
        to the Savior; but he cannot attain an increase of it, before he trusts
        in Him for it as a part of his salvation. Shall not be ashamed. — Of the
        word ashamed it has been observed, ch. 5:5, that it may import either
        that our hope will not be disappointed, or that it will not allow us to
        be ashamed of its object; and in ch. 9:33, the same quotation as in the
        verse before us is expounded, of not being ashamed to own Christ before
        unbelievers, or of being put to shame before Him at His coming. In the
        last sense, it may be observed that almost all men have some hope in
        prospect of the bar of God. But many have hopes founded on falsehood.
        There is a vast variety in the opinions of men with respect to the
        ground of hope; and, besides the common ground, namely, a mixture of
        mercy and merit, every unbeliever has something peculiar to himself,
        which he deems an alleviation of guilt, or singularly meritorious.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the great day all shall be ashamed of their hope, except those
        who have believed in Christ for salvation. Believers alone shall not be
        ashamed before Him at His coming. This is true, and no doubt is referred
        to by the Prophet from whom the quotation is here made, without,
        however, excluding the present effect in this life of believing in
        Christ, namely, that they who do so shall not be ashamed to confess
        their hope in Him. This last sense suits the connection in this place,
        and appears to be the meaning here attached to the word ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for
        the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        For there is no difference. — So far from the Gentiles being excluded
        from mercy altogether, there is not, in this respect, the smallest
        difference between them and the Jews. Is rich. — That is, rich to bestow
        on both Jews and Gentiles all they need. Calvin is not to be followed in
        explaining the word rich here as meaning ‘kind and beneficent.’ This
        would sanction any abuse of words that the wildest imagination could
        invent. Nor is there any need of such an expedient. The meaning, as here
        explained, is quite obvious. Unto all that call upon Him . — God is able
        to supply the wants of all that call upon Him, and He will supply them.
        All of them receive out of the fullness of Jesus Christ. Here it is
        imported that to call on the name of the Lord is to be a believer. Let
        it then be understood that to call on the Lord implies to call on Him in
        faith as He is revealed in the Gospel. There must be the knowledge of
        God as a just God, and a Savior, before any one can call on Him. To call
        on the Lord in this sense, amounts to the same thing as to believe in
        Christ for salvation, and it implies that every believer is one who
        calls on God. If any man professes to be a believer, and does not
        habitually call on God, he is not what he pretends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
        saved. ‘The context in Joel,’ says Calvin, ‘will fully satisfy us that
        his prediction applies to this passage of Paul.’ But why should we need
        anything to convince us of this, but the authority of the Apostle
        himself? It is a most pernicious method of interpreting the applications
        of the Old Testament in the New, to make our perception of their
        justness the ground of acknowledging the Apostle’s conclusion. It may be
        proper to show how far or how clearly the words of the prophecy
        establish the particular reference made by the Apostle. But whether we
        can explain the application or not, the interpretation of the Apostle is
        as infallible as the prophecy itself. If one will undertake to vindicate
        the justness of the Apostle’s conclusion, another may be inclined to
        question it, and to allege that the prophecy has not the meaning
        assigned to it by the Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here implied, that in order to salvation it is necessary to call
        on the Lord, and that whoever does so shall be saved. Here, as in other
        places of Scripture, the name of the Lord signifies the Lord Himself. By
        calling on the name of the Lord, all the parts of religious worship
        which we render to God are intended. It denotes a full and entire
        communion with God. He who calls on the name of the Lord, profoundly
        humbles himself before God, recognizes His power, adores His majesty,
        believes His promises, confides in His goodness, hopes in His mercy,
        honors Him as his God, and loves Him as his Savior. It supposes that
        this invocation is inseparable from all the other parts of religion. To
        call on the name of the Lord, is to place ourselves under His
        protection, and to have recourse to Him for His aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why does the Prophet ascribe deliverance or salvation to calling on
        the name of the Lord, and not merely say, ‘Whoever calls on God shall be
        heard, shall be protected, shall receive His blessing?’ The reason is,
        that he was treating of the new covenant, which clearly, without a veil
        and without a figure, announces salvation in opposition to the former
        covenant, which held forth temporal blessings. The Gospel speaks plainly
        of salvation, that is to say, of eternal happiness which we should
        expect after death. He uses the term saved, in order to remind us of the
        unhappy condition in which we were by nature, and to show the difference
        between our state and that of angels, for the angels live, but are not
        saved. The life of which Jesus Christ is the fountain, finds us plunged
        in death, lost in ourselves, children of wrath, and it is given us under
        the title of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one ever called upon the Lord, in the Scripture sense of this phrase,
        without being saved. It is here as expressly said, ‘Whosoever shall call
        upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,’ as it is, ‘Whoever believeth
        shall be saved.’ It appears that Paul, when he here speaks of calling
        upon the Lord, refers to the Lord Jesus Christ, whom he had named in the
        9th verse. In the same way he addresses the church at Corinth, ‘With all
        that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In thus calling upon the Lord, a believer, like Enoch, walks with God.
        It is not only that he prays to God at stated seasons; his life is a
        life of prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He prays to God ‘everywhere,’ and ‘always.’ He remembers that Jesus hath
        said, ‘Henceforth I call you not servants; but I have called you
        friends;’ He serves God, therefore, in newness of spirit, and goes to
        Him in all occasions as his covenant God, his Father, and his Friend, to
        whom he pours out his heart, makes known all his wants, difficulties,
        and desires, and consults Him On every occasion in matters great and
        small. From this holy and constant communion he is not at any time or in
        any circumstances precluded. In Nehemiah we have beautiful and
        encouraging examples both of stated and ejaculatory prayer in unforeseen
        circumstances, see ch. 2:4; in short, of a continual appeal to God, ch.
        13:29. Paul commands us to ‘pray without ceasing.’ To the exercise of
        this duty, so frequently enforced by the Lord in His last discourse to
        His disciples, believers have the highest encouragement. ‘Whatsoever ye
        shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you.’ ‘If ye abide in
        Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall
        be done unto you.’ We see, in the sequel, the effect of David’s short
        prayer, ‘O Lord, I pray Thee turn the counsel of Ahithophel into
        foolishness.’

        Although the Lord shows Himself at all times so ready to answer the
        prayers of His people, yet in the transaction with the Gibeonites,
        Joshua and the elders of Israel ‘asked not counsel at the mouth of the
        Lord,’ and what was the consequence? We are ready to be astonished at
        their conduct in this instance, yet how often is similar negligence or
        unbelief exemplified in the life of every Christian! even after he has
        received, in innumerable instances, gracious answers to his petitions,
        so often reproving his little faith when he presented them; and after he
        has experienced so many distressing proofs of the evil of being left to
        his own counsels when he has neglected this duty, Joshua 9:14.
