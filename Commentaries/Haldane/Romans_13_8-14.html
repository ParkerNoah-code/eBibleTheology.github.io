      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that
        loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Owe no man anything. — In the beginning of the former verse the Apostle
        commands Christians to render to all their dues, which includes debts of
        money as well as of respect. Here he forbids them to owe any man
        anything, that is, to withhold from any man what is his due. This duty
        is imperative, and requires to be particularly specified; and in this
        way the Apostle follows out the precept he had given in the preceding
        verse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians ought to attend most scrupulously to this injunction. It is a
        great injury to men, and a reproach to Christianity, when the servants
        of God neglect this duty. It is a virtual breach of the eighth
        commandment, although it may not bring on them the same obloquy. But to
        love one another. — Love is here beautifully represented as a debt that
        is never paid. It is a debt that ever remains due. Christians ought not
        only to love one another continually, but to abound in love more and
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more they pay of this debt, the richer will they be in the thing
        that is paid. For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. — Here
        love is urged, on the ground that it is fulfillment of the law in all
        its precepts. The whole law is grounded on love to God and love to man.
        This cannot be violated without the breach of law; and if there is love,
        it will influence to the observance of all God’s commandments. If there
        were perfect love, there would be a perfect observance of the law. But
        no man loveth another in the perfection that the law requires; therefore
        no man perfectly keeps the law. Love, then, is the fulfillment of the
        law, being the thing which it demands, and all that it demands in
        respect to both God and man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9 — For this, Thou shalt rot commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
        Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not
        covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended
        in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here cites several of the precepts of the second table of the law,
        and observes with respect to each of them, that they are comprehended in
        the law that enjoins us to love our neighbor as ourselves. Nothing can
        be more evident than that if we loved our neighbor perfectly, we would
        commit none of the things here specified. The law of the Lord is
        admirable, both in its simplicity and comprehensives. It is also most
        reasonable and just. It requires nothing but what is implied in love.
        Its prohibitions, then, are not unreasonable restraints upon our
        liberty, but the just requirements of love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the
        fulfilling of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love worketh no ill to his neighbor. — Love never injures our neighbor
        in any respect, but, on the contrary, as far as in its power, does him
        service.
      </p>
      <p>
        All disputes, then, among neighbors and among nations proceed from a
        want of love. What, then, shall we say of the morality of men in
        general, who live in strife and contention, as often as their interests
        in the smallest degree interfere? What is the origin of all the disputes
        in the world but a want of love? Therefore love is the fulfilling of the
        law. — As love will prevent everything which the law forbids, love must
        consequently be what fulfills the law. Love, for instance, will prevent
        murder, and even the smallest degree of hatred to another. Love, then,
        will keep the sixth commandment; and so of each of the commandments of
        the second table of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
        out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
        ‘The most appropriate meaning that can be given to the word translated
        that in this occurrence seems to be especially. The duties recommended
        were the rather to be attended to, from the alleged consideration that
        follows. Dr. Macknight translates by supplying the phrase, ‘I command,’
        by ellipsis, ‘Also this I command.’ And Mr. Stuart supplies the words,
        ‘Do this’ There is no need for these supplements, and the above gives
        the most appropriate meaning. Knowing the time. — The time is understood
        by Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart as referring to the season of the
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the ground of the observation, which is subjoined by the Apostle,
        shows that it refers to the present time, in distinction from the time
        when those whom he addressed first believed. Why is it time to awake out
        of sleep? The reason alleged is, for now is our salvation nearer than
        when we believed. It is plain, then, that the times contrasted are the
        time of their first believing, and the time then present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salvation is here understood by Dr. Macknight as signifying the glad
        tidings of salvation in the Gospel. This meaning is so forced and
        unnatural,, that it deserves no consideration. In the Scriptures,
        believers are considered as saved from the moment they are partakers of
        a Divine life, by the belief of the truth. Salvation is also sometimes
        used with respect to the complete deliverance from the pollution of sin
        at death, when believers enter into heavenly happiness. And sometimes it
        refers to the day of judgment, when their happiness will be more
        complete, and when the body as well as the soul shall enter into glory.
        It is obviously in the second acceptation that the word salvation is
        here used. It was now a considerable time since the church at Rome had
        been gathered, and the brethren who were first called to the knowledge
        of the truth were now approaching the period of their entrance into the
        land of promise. The near prospect of leaving this world, and entering
        into a state of glory, ought to have a great effect upon Christians, in
        making them think less of this world, and more of that of which they are
        about to become the inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
        cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
        The night is far spent, the day is at hand. — Dr. Macknight understands
        this of ‘the night of heathenish ignorance,’ which he says ‘is drawing
        to a conclusion;’ and to the same purpose Mr. Stuart says that it ‘is
        the time of ignorance and darkness in which they had once been.’ But
        with respect to the time in which the persons here addressed were in
        ignorance and darkness, if he means heathen ignorance and darkness, this
        time was already at an end to them; and the day, as contrasted with
        this, was already present, and could not be represented as near. And as
        to the night of heathenish ignorance being nearly at an end, this is far
        from past. Nearly eighteen centuries have passed since this Epistle was
        written, and the night of heathenish, so far from being at an end, still
        broods over the greater part of the world. The night here must be the
        time of the believer’s being on earth; for his earthly state, with all
        its comparative light, is but night with respect to the light of heaven.
        The day which was at hand was not the day of judgment, but the day of
        death, with respect to those addressed. Mr. Stuart notices, and
        satisfactorily refutes, the opinion of Mr. Tholack and the Germans,
        which represents the Apostles as believing the near approach of the day
        of judgment. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us
        put on the armor of light. — In place of the clothing of sin, Christians
        are to cover themselves with the armor of light. The Christian is a
        soldier, and as such he is furnished with a complete suit of armor, to
        fit him for the encounter with his enemies. It consists of faith, and
        love, and hope. ‘ Let us who are of the day be sober, putting — on the
        breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
        drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
        envying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us walk honestly, as in the day. — According to the present use of
        the language, ‘honestly’ does not adequately represent the original. The
        word signifies decently, becomingly. We are by this precept required to
        conduct ourselves before the world in a modest, decent, and becoming
        manner. The allusion is to persons walking from place to place in
        transacting their daily business. The conduct of persons thus employed
        shows, even in people the most immoral, some regard to appearances; and
        they who riot in the night will place a restraint on their conduct in
        the day. Christians, then, as in the light of day, ought to conduct
        themselves in a manner suitable to the day, and not like those who riot
        in the night. It may be observed that the same figure is here still
        continued, but varied in its application. When it is said that the night
        is far spent, and the day is at hand, it is implied that it was still
        night, and that the day was future. But here the day is present. In one
        point of view it is night to the Christian, and in another it is day.
        Not in, rioting. — The word applies to all meetings for intemperance and
        debauchery. It denounces all amusements that minister to the impure
        passions of human nature, whatever may be their name. The fashionable
        follies of high life, and those practiced by persons in inferior
        stations, are alike inconsistent with the Christian character and with
        this precept. It is vain to allege with respect to them that they are
        not expressly condemned in Scripture. The Scripture does not give out
        law with a verbose phraseology, like the laws of men, but condemns all
        the particular and ever-varying follies of mankind in every age and
        nation on general principles. Drunkenness. — This sin is one of the
        greatest destroyers of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even were there no hereafter, a wise man would shun it as a pestilence.
        No other evil has so great a share in bringing ruin on individuals and
        families.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every approach to it ought to be most carefully avoided. Too much
        caution cannot be used in order to guard against the formation of habits
        of intemperance. Many a promising professor of Christianity makes
        shipwreck of the faith by giving way to this vice. It is a mistaken
        hospitality that tempts to any approach to intemperance. If we are to
        eat and drink to the glory of God, we ought to drink no more than is
        really useful for the health. Chambering. — The meaning of this is
        plain, as well as of wantonness, which refers to all licentiousness, in
        its most extensive import. Strife and envy. — The former applies to
        every kind of contention; and the latter designates that principle
        which, more than any other, excites to strife or contention, and tends
        to make a man an enemy to his kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
        for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof. Put ye on the Lord Jesus. —
        Having given a specimen of the things that are unbecoming the Christian
        who walks in the day, the Apostle now shows, summarily, what the conduct
        is which he enjoins on us to exemplify.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers were in themselves wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
        blind, and naked; like Joshua, clothed with filthy garments; but when
        they come to Christ, He says, ‘Take away the filthy garments from him:
        behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will
        clothe thee with change of raiment.’ They are then clothed with the
        garments of salvation, and covered with the robe of righteousness,
        Isaiah 61:10; and being thus justified, those whom the Apostle addressed
        had put on Christ. But here it is their progress in sanctification he
        has in view. In the twelfth verse he had exhorted them to put on the
        armor of light; now he is enjoining the duty of perfect conformity to
        His holy image, bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
        of Christ; who gave us an example that we should follow His steps, who
        did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth. Thus we are to cleave
        to Him with purpose of heart, and, as the Apostle elsewhere exhorts,
        that as we have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so we should walk in
        Him. ‘To put on Christ,’ says Calvin, ‘means our being surrounded and
        protected in every part by the virtue of His Spirit, and thus rendered
        fit for the performance of every duty of holiness. For the image of God,
        which is the only ornament of the soul, is thus renewed in us.’
        Provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof — Flesh here means
        the sinful principles of our nature. We are to make provision for the
        wants of the body, but we are to make no provision for its lusts.
        Whatever, then, tends to excite our corrupt propensities ought to be
        avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beautiful are the reflections of Archbishop Leighton, in his sermon on
        the four last verses of this chapter, from which what follows is
        extracted: — ’These words are as an alarm, or morning watch-bell, of
        singular use, not only awakening a Christian to his day work, but withal
        minding him what he is. The former verses, 11, 12, tell us it is time to
        rise, and call us to put on our clothes, and, being soldiers, our arms.
        Verse 13th directeth our behavior and employment throughout the day. The
        last verse doth shortly and clearly fold up both together. ‘All the days
        of sinful nature are dark night, in which there is no right discerning
        of spiritual things: Some light there is of reason to direct natural and
        civil actions, but no daylight till the sun arise. ‘Tis night still, for
        all the stars, and the moon to help them: Notwithstanding natural
        speculation that are more remote, and all prudence and policy for
        affairs, that come somewhat nearer to actions, yet we are still in the
        night; and men sleep on in it, and their heads are still full of new
        dreams that keep them sleeping.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are constantly drunk with cares or desires of sense, and so their
        sleep continues. Now sleep is brother of death, and so by it not unfitly
        is the same state resembled. ‘It is time to awake, salvation is nearer
        than when ye believed. The bright day you look for is posting forward;
        it is nearer than when you began to believe: the night is far spent, the
        gross darkness is already past, some daylight it is, and is every moment
        growing, and the perfect full morning light of it is very near. O
        blessed Gospel revealing God in Christ, and calling up sinners to
        communion with him, dispelling that black night of ignorance and
        accursed darkness that otherwise had never ended, but passed on to a
        night of eternal misery. ‘Put on the Lord Jesus. — Here we have the
        proper beauty and ornament of Christians. Him we put on by faith and are
        clothed with Him as our righteousness. We come unto our Father, in our
        Elder Brother’s perfumed garment, and so obtain the blessing, which He,
        in a manner, was stripped of, and did undergo the curse, and was made a
        curse for our sakes. So the Apostle speaks of Him. We put Him on as the
        Lord our righteousness, and are made the righteousness of God in Him.
        This investiture is first, when our persons are made acceptable, and we
        come into court. But there is another putting of Him on, in the
        conformity of holiness, which always accompanies the former, and that is
        it which is here meant. And this I declare unto you, that whosoever does
        not thus put Him on, shall find themselves deceived in the other, if
        they imagine it belongs to them. He is the armor of light before spoken
        of; all our ornament and safety is in Him. ‘Now follows, and make no
        provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof; and it will
        follow necessarily. O! to have the heart touched by the Spirit with such
        a word as is here — it would untie it from all these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the words the very reading of which wrought so with Augustine,
        that, of a licentious young man, he turned a holy, faithful servant of
        Jesus Christ. While you were without Christ, you had no higher nor other
        business to do but to attend and serve the flesh; but once having put
        Him on, you are other men, and other manners do become you. There is a
        transcendent sweetness in Christ, that puts the flesh out of credit. Put
        on Christ, thy royal robe, and make no provision for the flesh. A soul
        clothed with Christ, stooping to any sinful delight, or an ardent
        pursuit of anything earthly, though lawful, doth wonderfully indignity
        itself. ‘Oh! raise up your spirits, you that pretend to anything in
        Christ; delight in Him, and let His love satisfy you at all times. What
        need you go a-begging elsewhere? All you would add makes you the poorer,
        abates so much of your enjoyment of Him; and what can compensate that?
        Put on the Lord Jesus, and then view yourselves, and see if you be fit
        to be slaves to flesh and earth. ‘These two, put on the Lord Jesus , and
        make no provision for the, flesh, are directly the representation of the
        Church — a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet,
        needed borrow no beauty from it, or anything under it.’
