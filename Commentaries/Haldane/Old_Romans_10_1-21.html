      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 10:1-21</p>
      <p>
        PAUL was fully aware that the doctrine of the sovereignty of God in the
        rejection of the Jews and the preaching of salvation to the Gentiles,
        would greatly offend his countrymen. He accordingly begins this chapter
        with an acknowledgment of their sincerity as actuated by a zeal of God;
        but before prosecuting the subject of God’s sovereignty further, he more
        particularly recurs to their unbelief, to which in the preceding chapter
        he had already alluded. This leads him to remark the contrast between
        the righteousness of the law and the righteousness of faith. He next
        insists on the free invitations of the Gospel, which proclaims salvation
        to all of every nation who believe, and from this takes occasion to
        point out the necessity of preaching it to the Gentiles. The Gentiles,
        as he had before proved, were among the children of the promise made to
        Abraham, and it was only by means of the Gospel that they could be
        brought to the knowledge of Christ, through which alone the promise to
        them could be fulfilled. This duty, notwithstanding the objections of
        the Jews, he therefore urges, and enforces it by referring to the
        Scriptures, while he answers the objection, that the Gospel had not been
        generally received. In the last place, he proves, by the testimony of
        the Prophets, that the rejection of Israel and the in gathering of the
        Gentiles had been long before predicted, and concludes the chapter by
        showing that the Jews had both heard and rejected the gracious and long
        continued invitations to reconciliation with God. In the whole of this
        chapter, Paul treats in a practical way what in the preceding one he had
        chiefly referred to the sovereignty of God, to which he afterwards
        revert.
      </p>
      <p>
        We here see a beautiful example in Paul of the meekness and gentleness
        of the Lord Jesus Christ, who prayed for His murderers. The Jews
        considered Paul as one of their greatest enemies. They had persecuted
        him from city to city, again and again they had attempted his life, and
        had succeeded in depriving him of his liberty, yet his affection for
        them was not diminished. He prayed for them, he accommodated himself to
        their prejudices as far as his obedience to God permitted, and thus he
        labored by all means to save some. He here assures those to whom he
        writes of his cordial good will towards Israel, and of his prayers to
        God that they might be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
        that they might be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brethren. — Those here addressed are the brethren in Christ to whom Paul
        wrote, and not the Jews in general, who were his brethren in the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no doubt but by apostrophe he might address the unbelieving
        Jews; but there is nothing like an apostrophe here, nor is there any
        need of such a supposition. Whoever was addressed, the sentiment would
        be equally well understood by the unbelieving Jews who should read or
        hear the Epistle. My heart’s desire and prayer to God. — It is of great
        importance to remove prejudices as far as possible, and to show good
        will to those whom we wish to benefit by the publication of Divine
        truth. We see here the love of a Christian to his bitterest enemies.
        Paul was abused, reviled, and persecuted by his countrymen, yet he not
        only forgave them, but constantly prayed for their conversion.
        Unbelievers often accuse Christians, though very falsely, as haters of
        mankind, because they faithfully declare that there is no salvation but
        through faith in Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we should especially remark, that while the salvation of his
        countrymen was the desire of Paul’s heart, and while he was endeavoring
        in every way possible to call their attention to the Gospel, he did not
        neglect to offer up prayer for them to God. Other means, as we have
        opportunity, should not be left untried; but prayer is at all times in
        our power, and in this we should ever persevere. When we are shut out
        from access to man, we have always access to God, and with Him is the
        residue of the Spirit. In this duty, we learn from the Epistles that
        Paul was ever much engaged for his brethren in Christ, and here we see
        that he did not neglect it in behalf of those by whom he was hated and
        persecuted. He thus obeyed the injunctions, and imitated the example, of
        our blessed Lord. In this verse, too, standing in connection with what
        immediately precedes it, we learn that Paul’s faithful annunciation of
        these doctrines, which by so many are most erroneously considered as
        harsh towards men, and unfavorable to the character of God, so far from
        being opposed to feelings of the warmest affection for others, is
        closely and intimately conjoined with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should never cease to pray for, and to use all proper means for the
        conversion of, those who either oppose the Gospel with violence, or from
        some preconceived opinion. Secret things belong to God, and none can
        tell whether or not they are among the number of the elect. No one among
        the Jews was more opposed to the Gospel than Paul himself had been; and
        every Christian who knows his own heart, and who recollects the state of
        his mind before his conversion, should consider the repugnance he once
        felt to the doctrine of grace. We ought not, indeed, to treat those as
        Christians who do not appear to be such. This would be directly opposed
        to the dictates of charity, and would tend to lull them into a false
        security.
      </p>
      <p>
        But assuredly none can have such powerful inducements to exercise
        patience towards any who reject the Gospel, as they who know who it is
        that has made them to differ from others, and that by the grace of God
        they are what they are. These considerations have a direct tendency to
        make them humble and gentle. Those who are elected shall indeed be
        finally saved, but this will-take place through the means which God has
        appointed. It is on this ground that Paul says, ‘Therefore I endure all
        things for the elect’s sake, that they may also obtain the salvation
        which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — For I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not
        according to knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul acknowledged that the Jews had a zeal of God, and so far he
        approved of them, and was on that account the more interested in their
        behalf. This had formerly been the case with himself, Acts 26:9;
        Galatians 1:14. Their zeal, however, and the sincerity of their
        attachment to their system, was no excuse for their unbelief. The
        Apostle had sorrow for their condemnation, not hope of their salvation
        on account of their sincerity and zeal. This is an important lesson to
        thousands who profess Christianity. How often is it said that if a man
        be sincere in his belief, his creed is of no great importance. His
        salvation, it is supposed, is not endangered by his ignorance or error.
        How far on this head does the Apostle Paul differ from those who thus
        judge, while his love to mankind cannot be doubted. His love to his
        countrymen appears to have exceeded anything to which the persons
        alluded to can pretend. Yet he bewails the Jews as under condemnation on
        account of their ignorance. We see here that men may attend to religion,
        and be much occupied on the subject, without being acceptable to God;
        and that sincerity in error is neither a means of salvation nor an
        excuse for any man. Nothing but the natural alienation of their minds
        from God prevents those who possess the Scriptures from understanding
        the way of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going
        about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
        themselves unto the righteousness of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ground of rejection of the Gospel by the Jews was their ignorance of
        God’s righteousness. Had they understood this, they would have ceased to
        go about to establish their own righteousness; but not understanding
        that righteousness which God has provided in His Son, they rejected the
        salvation of the Gospel. Mr. Stuart translates the word rendered
        righteousness throughout this passage by the word justification, which
        is warranted by no authority. Dr. Macknight, who, like Mr. Stuart,
        denies the imputation of Christ’s righteousness, says that the
        righteousness here spoken of is ‘the righteousness which God appointed
        at the fall, as the righteousness of sinners,’ which he explains
        elsewhere to mean faith, saying that God ‘hath declared that He will
        accept and reward it as righteousness.’ Dr. Campbell of Aberdeen, as has
        been formerly noticed, explains the righteousness here spoken of as that
        ‘purer scheme of morality which was truly of God,’ opposed to the
        ‘system of morality or righteousness fabricated by the Jews.’ In this
        manner do these writers, though each in a different way, make void all
        that is said throughout this Epistle and elsewhere in the Scriptures on
        that most important expression, ‘the righteousness of God,’ through the
        revelation of which the Apostle declares that the Gospel ‘is the power
        of God unto salvation,’ Romans 1:17. The righteousness of God. — That
        is, the righteousness provided by God and revealed in the Gospel, which
        is received by faith, by which men are saved; and he who does not submit
        to this righteousness, and humbly receive it, but supposes that he can
        do something to give him a right to obtain or to merit it, or who
        attempts to add to it anything of his own, or to substitute in its place
        his own obedience, more or less, is equally ignorant of the corruption
        of his own heart, of the holiness of God, and of the perfection of the
        obedience which the law requires. In this verse the fatal error is
        clearly expressed of those who expect to be saved by any works of their
        own, even when, like the Pharisee who prayed in the temple, they ascribe
        to God all that they suppose to be good in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
        one that believeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here declares what he means by the righteousness of God, to
        which the Jews would not submit, namely, the fulfillment, object, and
        consummation of the law by our Lord Jesus Christ. The end of the law. —
        What the end of the law is, Paul shows, Romans 7:10, when he says, It
        was ordained to life, namely, that the man who doeth all that it
        commands, should live by it. And what is it that, in the present state
        of human nature, the law cannot do? It cannot justify, and so give life,
        because it has been broken. How then did God act? He sent His Son in the
        likeness of sinful flesh, and condemned sin in the flesh. And why has He
        done this? The answer is given, ch. 8:4, ‘that the righteousness of the
        law might be fulfilled in us’ who are in Him. Thus it is, that Christ is
        the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. By Him
        is accomplished for all such the whole purpose and object of the law —
        all its demands being fulfilled, and the end for which it was given
        attained. Christ thus redeems His people from its curse, and procures
        for them the blessing of life, which, under the righteous government of
        God, He confers on all His creatures who are conformed to His holy law.
        The fallen angels possessed life while they retained their obedience,
        and Adam, while he held fast His integrity; but this was not the full
        end of the law, for they apostatized. In them, therefore, the law fell
        short of attaining its end. But the righteousness imputed to those who
        believe in Christ is ‘everlasting righteousness,’ Daniel 9:24, and
        therefore to them belongs eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their life is comprised in His life, and He is ‘that eternal life;’ and
        ‘when He who is their life shall appear, they shall appear with Him in
        glory.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, Jesus says, ‘I am come that they might have life, and that
        they might have it more abundantly.’ ‘I have finished,’ said our blessed
        Lord in His intercessory prayer to His Father, ‘the work which Thou
        gavest Me to do;’ and on the cross, just before He expired, He said, It
        is finished. In each of these passages The word rendered finished is the
        same as that which is here translated end, signifying accomplished,
        consummated, or perfected. In the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:1, the same
        original word is rendered ‘perfection.’ The Apostle there says, ‘Let us
        go on to perfection’ — to the end or finishing, meaning the consummation
        or completion of all that the law required, which he shows was found in
        the sacrifice and work of Jesus Christ. This perfection — this end — was
        not attained by the Levitical priesthood; for if ‘perfection were by the
        Levitical priesthood, what further need was there that another Priest
        should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the
        order of Aaron?’ Hebrews 7:11. Nor was it attained by the legal
        dispensation, which ‘made nothing perfect,’ ver. 19, — brought nothing
        to its end or consummation. This was found only in Christ, ‘for by one
        offering He hath perfected for ever (still the same word in the original
        in all these places) them that are sanctified,’ Hebrews 10:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that Christ was the perfection or the end of the law, is the
        great object of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which furnishes a complete
        commentary on the passage before us. That Epistle opens with declaring
        Jesus Christ to be the Son of God. To prove and to establish this grand
        truth, as the foundation of all that the Apostle was afterwards to
        advance, was essential to his purpose. For by no one in the whole
        universe, excepting by Him who is infinite, could the eternal or
        everlasting righteousness predicted by Daniel have been brought in. It
        was, then, this important truth, that Christ is the end of the law for
        righteousness to every one that believeth, which Paul labors in that
        Epistle to impress on the minds of the Jewish converts, for the
        confirmation of their faith; and it was the ignorance of this same
        important truth in the great body of the nation, which in the chapter
        before us he laments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unbelieving Jews vainly went about to establish their own
        righteousness by their obedience to the law, instead of viewing it as a
        schoolmaster to lead them unto, or until, the coming of Christ, by whom
        alone it could be and was fulfilled, Matthew 5:18. This verifies what
        the Apostle says, 2 Corinthians 3:13, that ‘the children of Israel could
        not look steadfastly to the end’ (the same word as in the verse before
        us) ‘of that which is abolished.’ Christ, then, as is declared in this
        verse, is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
        believeth. For the moment that a man believes in Him, the end of the law
        is attained in that man; that is, it is fulfilled in him, and he is in
        possession of that righteousness which the law requires, or ever can
        require, and consequently he hath eternal life, John 6:54, to which the
        law was ordained, Romans 7:10. Christ, then, by His obedience has
        fulfilled the law of God in every form in which men have been under it,
        that His obedience or righteousness might be imputed as their
        righteousness to all who believe, ‘He hath made Him to be sin for us,
        who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him,’
        2 Corinthians 5:21. ‘Surely, shall one say, In the Lord have I
        righteousness,’ Isaiah 45:24. ‘He shall be called Jehovah our
        righteousness,’ Jeremiah 23:6. This is the only righteousness in which a
        man can stand before God in judgment, and which shall be acknowledged in
        the great day. They, and they only, who, by their works proceeding from
        that faith which unites the soul to Christ, and which receives this
        righteousness, are proved to possess it, shall then be pronounced
        ‘righteous,’ Matthew 25:37,46. This righteousness is imputed to every
        one that believeth, and to such only. This makes it clear that Jesus
        Christ has not fulfilled the law for mankind in general, but for those
        in particular who should believe in His name, John 17:9,20. His
        atonement and intercession are of the same extent, and are presented for
        the same individuals. ‘I pray not for the world, but for them which Thou
        hast given Me.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart, in his explanation of this 4th verse, introduces the
        following quotation from Flatt: — ‘Christ is the te>lov no>mou (end of
        the law) in respect to dikaiosu >nh (righteousness), He has brought it
        about, that we should not be judged after the strictness of the law. He
        has removed the sentence of condemnation from all those who receive the
        Gospel.’ To this Mr. Stuart adds — ’Well and truly.’ That the sentence
        of condemnation is removed from all who receive the Gospel, although in
        a very different way from what Mr. Stuart supposes, is most certain. But
        no sentiment can be more unscriptural than that we shall not be judged
        after the strictness of the law. For what saith the Scripture? ‘He hath
        appointed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness.’ In
        that day, instead of men not being judged after the strictness of the
        law, judgment will be laid to the line, and righteousness to the
        plummet, and all those in whom the righteousness of the law has not been
        fulfilled in all its demands, without the defalcation of one jot or
        tittle, will be found under its curse, and that awful sentence will be
        pronounced on them, ‘Depart from Me, ye cursed.’ The judgment, in
        accordance with every representation of it contained in Scripture, and
        with the whole plan of salvation, will be conducted in all respects,
        both as to those who shall be saved and those who shall be condemned,
        after the strictness of both law and justice. Under the righteous
        government of God, never was one sin committed which will not be
        punished either in the person of him who committed it, or in that of the
        Divine Surety of the new covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
        That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This illustrates what the Apostle had just before said, that Christ, and
        Christ alone, has fulfilled the demands of the law, and therefore in
        vain shall life be sought by any man’s personal obedience to its
        commandments. To live by the law requires, as Moses had declared, that
        the law be perfectly obeyed. But this to fallen man is impossible. The
        law knows no mercy; it knows no mitigation, it overlooks not even the
        smallest breach, or the smallest deficiency. One guilty thought or
        desire would condemn for ever. Whoever, then, looks for life by the law,
        must keep the whole law in thought, word, and deed, and not be
        chargeable with the smallest transgression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
        Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven (that is, to bring
        Christ down from above:) Ver. 7. — Or, Who shall descend into the deep?
        (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) Ver. 8. — But what
        saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart;
        that is, the word of faith which we preach; We should rather expect
        contrast in every point of view than coincidence between the law given
        by Moses and the Gospel of Christ. Can there then be any illustration of
        the receiving of righteousness by faith, which is here the Apostle’s
        subject, and the precepts that were given to the Israelites as a shadow
        of the Gospel? Doubtless, with all the difference between the law and
        the Gospel, there must be a point of view in which they are coincident,
        for in such a view it is that he chiefly makes his quotation. Paul
        alleges the passage to which he refers, Deuteronomy 30:11-14, as in a
        certain respect speaking the language of the righteousness of faith. The
        language used by Moses described the clearness of the manner of giving
        the knowledge of the Divine requirements to the people of Israel. But
        though this was its original object, yet it had a further reference to
        the clearness of the manner of revealing the Gospel. For the Apostle
        explains it, ‘That is, to bring Christ down from above.’ The language,
        then, that describes the clearness of the revelation of the precepts of
        God to Israel, was a figure of the clearness of the revelation of the
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses gave the Israelites a law which was to abide with them for their
        constant instruction. They were not obliged to send a messenger to
        heaven to learn how they were to serve God, nor to search out wisdom by
        their own understanding. Nor had they to send over the sea to distant
        countries, like the heathens, for instruction. God by Moses taught them
        everything with respect to His worship and service in the fullest,
        clearest, and most practical manner. This was a shadow of the clearness
        of the revelation of the righteousness received by faith, which we are
        not left to search for by means through which it never can be obtained.
        Salvation is brought nigh to us, being proclaimed in the Gospel by the
        death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The word is in our mouth. We
        receive the righteousness He has brought, not by any efforts of our own
        in seeking salvation, and laboring to keep the law of God, but by the
        belief of that word which was published at Jerusalem, announcing
        salvation to the guiltiest of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel is contained in figure in every part of the law. The very
        manner of giving the law was a shadow of the Gospel, and typified
        salvation through a great Mediator. And though the New Testament often
        contrasts the demands of the law with the voice of mercy speaking in the
        Gospel, yet here the Gospel also speaks through the law. The reference
        to what Moses observed with respect to the precepts which he delivered
        from God to Israel, instead of finding an opposition to the plan of
        salvation through Christ, finds an illustration which Divine wisdom had
        prepared to shadow it, in the mission of the Mediator under the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wonderful is the wisdom of God manifested in the harmony of the Old and
        New Testaments. They who do not understand it, have labored to show a
        coincidence merely by accommodation. But the Spirit of God everywhere
        explains the language of the Old Testament, as in its design appointed
        by God to be a shadow of things of Christ’s kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        But though there is a coincidence, there is also a contrast between the
        law and the Gospel. While the language of the law is, ‘Do and live,’
        that righteousness which it demands, and which man is unable to perform,
        is, according to the Gospel, gratuitously communicated through faith.
        This righteousness is in Christ, and He is not at a distance, so that we
        must scale the heavens, or descend below the earth, — in one word,
        attempt what is impracticable, to come to Him, and derive from Him this
        benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        He and this righteousness are brought near unto us, as was long before
        predicted. ‘Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from
        righteousness: I bring near My righteousness; it shall not be far off,
        and My salvation shall not tarry,’ Isaiah 46:12. All men, till
        enlightened by the Spirit of God, seek salvation by doing something of
        which they imagine God will approve. If it is not complete, His mercy,
        they suppose, will still incline Him to accept of it for value; but
        without something of his own to present, man in his natural state never
        thinks of approaching God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing can be more self-evidently false than that man can merit from
        God. Yet, notwithstanding the folly of this supposition, it is only the
        energy of the Holy Spirit through the truth of the Gospel that will
        convince him of the fallacy. Even the very Gospel of the grace of God is
        seen through this false medium; and while men exclaim, ‘Grace, grace,’
        they continue to introduce a species of merit by putting Christ at a
        distance, and making access to Him a matter of time and difficulty. How
        different is the Gospel, as here exhibited by Paul!
      </p>
      <p>
        We must not attempt in any way to merit Christ, or to bring anything
        like an equivalent in our hand. The language of Scripture is, ‘Ho, every
        one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters: and he that hath no money;
        come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and
        without price.’ ‘He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the
        rich’ — they who are worthy in their own esteem, whose that they may
        find acceptance, bring something of their own — ’He hath sent empty
        away.’ ‘Say not,’ observes Archbishop Leighton, ‘unless I find some
        measure of sanctification, what right have I to apply Him (Christ) as my
        righteousness? This inverts the order, and prejudges thee of both. Thou
        must first, without finding, yea, or seeking anything in thyself but
        misery and guiltiness, lay hold on Him as thy righteousness; or else
        thou shalt never find sanctification by any other endeavor or pursuit.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
        shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead,
        thou shalt be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth. — The confession of Christ is
        salvation. But that confession which is salvation, is a confession which
        implies that the truth confessed with the mouth is known and received in
        the heart. The belief of the heart is therefore joined with the
        confession of the lips. Neither is genuine without the other, though it
        may be said that either the one or the other is salvation, because they
        who believe with the heart will confess with the tongue. If a man says,
        ‘I believe in Christ,’ yet denies Him when put to trial, or confesses
        Him with the lips, yet denies Him in His proper character, he neither
        confesses nor believes Christ. It should always be remembered, that if
        he believes anything different from the testimony of God relating to the
        person and work of the Savior, he does not believe the Gospel, but
        something, whatever it may be, which can neither sanctify nor save. The
        Gospel alone is the power of God unto salvation to every one who
        believes it. Hath raised Him from the dead — Why is so much stress laid
        on the resurrection? Was not the work of Christ in this world finished
        by His death? Most certainly it was. But His resurrection was the
        evidence that it was finished; and therefore the belief of His
        resurrection is put for that of the whole of His work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emphasis of the second person throughout this verse should be
        remarked. The Apostle does not speak indefinitely, but he says
        emphatically, If thou shalt confess with thy mouth, and shalt believe in
        thine heart, thou shalt be saved. He speaks of every one, so that all
        may examine themselves, for to every one believing and confessing,
        salvation is promised; thus teaching each one to apply the promise of
        salvation to himself by faith and confession. Thus the Apostle shows
        that every believer has as much certain assurance of his salvation as he
        certainly confesses Christ with his mouth, and as he believes in his
        heart, that the Lord Jesus was raised from the dead. Our assurance of
        salvation corresponds with the measure of our faith, and the boldness of
        our confession of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
        the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believeth unto righteousness. — That is, unto the receiving of
        righteousness, namely, the righteousness of Christ. This righteousness
        is called ‘the righteousness of faith,’ Romans 4:13 — not that it is in
        the faith, but it is so called as being received by faith, as it is
        said, Romans 3:22, ‘the righteousness which is by faith,’ and
        Philippians 3:9, ‘the righteousness which is of God by faith.’ Faith,
        then, is only the appointed medium or means of our union with Christ,
        through which we receive this righteousness, and not the righteousness
        itself. ‘Faith,’ says the Westminster Confession, ‘justifies a sinner in
        the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always
        accompany it; or of good works that are the fruits of it; nor as if the
        grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his
        justification; but only as it is an instrument, by which he receiveth
        and applieth Christ’s righteousness.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression, ‘Faith is counted to him for righteousness,’ Romans 4:3,
        is often supposed to mean, ‘is counted to him instead of, or as
        righteousness;’ but, as has been remarked on that text, p. 162, the
        literal rendering is not for righteousness, but unto righteousness, in
        conformity with the proper translation as in the verse before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faith of the Gospel is not a speculation, it is not such a knowledge
        of religion as may be acquired like human science. This may often have
        the appearance of true faith; but it is not ‘the substance of things
        hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.’ Many things connected with
        the Gospel may be believed by the natural man, and each of the doctrines
        taken separately may be in some way received by him, as notions of
        lights and colors are received by the blind. But the Gospel is never
        understood and believed, except by those who, according to the promise,
        are ‘taught of the Lord,’ Isaiah 54:13; who therefore know the Father
        and Him whom He hath sent, which is eternal life, John 17:3. In the
        parable of the sower, where only the fourth description of persons are
        represented as having truly and permanently received the word, they are
        characterized as understanding it, and they only bear fruit; the others
        understood it not, Matthew 13:19-23. ‘The natural man receiveth not the
        things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither
        can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned,’ 1 Corinthians
        2:14. It is impossible that a man can believe that to be the word of God
        which he regards as foolishness ‘No man can say’ (understanding and
        believing what he says) ‘that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost,’
        1 Corinthians 12:3. When Peter answered and said, ‘Thou art the Christ,
        the Son of the living God,’ ‘Blessed,’ said Jesus, ‘art thou, Simon
        Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but My
        Father which is in heaven,’ Matthew 16:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justifying faith is the belief of the testimony of Christ, and trust in
        Him who is the subject of that testimony. It is believing with the
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning those who received a good report through faith, it is
        declared that they saw or understood the promises; they were persuaded
        of their truth, and they embraced them, taking them home personally, and
        resting upon them. On the passage before us, Calvin remarks, ‘The seat
        of faith, it deserves to be observed, is not in the brain, but the
        heart; not that I wish to enter into any dispute concerning the part of
        the body which is the seat of faith, but since the word heart generally
        means a serious, sincere, ardent affection, I am desirous to show the
        confidence of faith to be a firm, efficacious, and operative principle
        in all the emotions and feelings of the soul, not a mere naked notion of
        the head.’ And with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. — A man
        becomes righteous, perfectly righteous, through believing God’s record
        concerning His Son. But the evidence that this faith is genuine is found
        in the open confession of the Lord with the mouth in everything in which
        His will is known. Confession of Christ is as necessary as faith in Him,
        but necessary for a different purpose. Faith is necessary to obtain the
        gift of righteousness. Confession is necessary to prove that this gift
        is received. If a man does not confess Christ at the hazard of life,
        character, property, liberty, and everything dear to him, he has not the
        faith of Christ. In saying, then, that confession is made unto
        salvation, the Apostle does not mean that it is the cause of salvation,
        or that without it the title to salvation is incomplete. When a man
        believes in his heart, he is justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        But confession of Christ is the effect of faith, and will be evidence of
        it at the last day. Faith which interests the sinner in the
        righteousness of Christ is manifested by the confession of His name in
        the midst of enemies, or in the face of danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — For the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on Him shall not
        be ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Scripture saith . — Here Paul shows that the Scriptures of the
        Prophets taught the same doctrine that he was teaching. This was not
        necessary in order to add authority to his own doctrine, — for he was
        equally inspired with the Prophets, — but in order to prove the perfect
        agreement of the Old and the New Testament, and to show that the Jews
        who denied that the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs with them, were in
        error, even on their own principles. By this reference to the
        Scriptures, too, the Apostle in the first place confirms the truth he
        had been so forcibly declaring concerning the language of the
        righteousness by faith, namely, that it was not necessary to make some
        impracticable attempts such as to ascend into heaven, or to descend into
        the deep — to come to Christ, since He was brought nigh to all in the
        preaching of the Gospel, which proclaimed that whosoever shall call on
        the name of the Lord shall be saved. And, in the next place, it afforded
        him an opportunity of recurring to the important truth, brought into
        view in the preceding chapter, of the Gentiles being fellow-heirs of
        that righteousness, such of them as believed the promises being part of
        the spiritual seed of Abraham, and equally interested in those promises
        with the believing remnant of the Jews. The natural and easy way in
        which Paul thus reverts to this subject, and connects it with his
        declarations concerning the perversion of the truth of God by the
        unbelieving part of the Jewish nation, in seeking to establish their own
        righteousness, and not submitting themselves to the righteousness of
        God, ought to be particularly remarked; as well as its opening the way
        for exhibiting the duty of preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles, and
        showing that, in respect to the manner in which they must be saved,
        there is no difference between them and the Jews. Whosoever believeth on
        Him. — This language of the Prophet extended mercy to the Gentiles, if
        they believed. Here it may be remarked, that the least degree of faith
        embraces Christ, and unites the soul to Him. Faith does not save us by
        being strong or weak. It is Jesus Christ by whom we are saved and not by
        our faith, which is only the instrument or hand by which we receive Him.
        It may be further remarked, that here, as in so many other parts of
        Scripture, we see a full warrant for every one of the human race to
        believe in Jesus Christ, with the certainty that in doing so he shall be
        saved. Some, however, may be disposed to say, ‘We are not humbled, or at
        least humbled enough for our sins, and therefore we dare not place
        confidence in Christ for His salvation.’ Such persons ought to know that
        true humiliation is a concomitant or a consequence of saving faith, but
        is not a ground of it. It gives a man no right to trust in Christ, — no
        title to Divine acceptance either of his person or of his performances.
        It is indeed, in the hand of the Spirit, a means of rendering a man
        willing to trust in the Lord Jesus, and the more of it he attains, he is
        the more willing; but it affords him no degree of warrant to trust in
        Him, — nor is it requisite it should; for by the invitations and calls
        of the Gospel he already is fully warranted, so well warranted, that
        nothing in himself can either diminish or increase his warrant. When any
        one, therefore, says that he dare not trust in the Redeemer, because he
        is not sufficiently humbled, he thereby shows that he is under the
        prevalence both of unbelief and of a legal spirit: of unbelief, — for he
        does not believe that by the calls and commands of God he is
        sufficiently warranted to rely on Christ, but that something more is
        requisite to afford him a sufficient warrant; of a legal spirit, — for
        he regards humiliation as that which must confer upon him a right to
        trust in Christ, since for want of it in a sufficient degree, he dare
        not intrust his salvation to Him. But he may be assured that he cannot
        obtain holy consolation till he come as he is, and place direct
        confidence in Jesus Christ for all his salvation; and that he cannot
        have true evangelical humiliation till he first trust in Christ for it,
        and so receive it by faith Out of His fullness. The more of this
        humiliation he attains, the more willing will he be to come as a sinner
        to the Savior; but he cannot attain an increase of it, before he trusts
        in Him for it as a part of his salvation. Shall not be ashamed. — Of the
        word ashamed it has been observed, ch. 5:5, that it may import either
        that our hope will not be disappointed, or that it will not allow us to
        be ashamed of its object; and in ch. 9:33, the same quotation as in the
        verse before us is expounded, of not being ashamed to own Christ before
        unbelievers, or of being put to shame before Him at His coming. In the
        last sense, it may be observed that almost all men have some hope in
        prospect of the bar of God. But many have hopes founded on falsehood.
        There is a vast variety in the opinions of men with respect to the
        ground of hope; and, besides the common ground, namely, a mixture of
        mercy and merit, every unbeliever has something peculiar to himself,
        which he deems an alleviation of guilt, or singularly meritorious.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the great day all shall be ashamed of their hope, except those
        who have believed in Christ for salvation. Believers alone shall not be
        ashamed before Him at His coming. This is true, and no doubt is referred
        to by the Prophet from whom the quotation is here made, without,
        however, excluding the present effect in this life of believing in
        Christ, namely, that they who do so shall not be ashamed to confess
        their hope in Him. This last sense suits the connection in this place,
        and appears to be the meaning here attached to the word ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for
        the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        For there is no difference. — So far from the Gentiles being excluded
        from mercy altogether, there is not, in this respect, the smallest
        difference between them and the Jews. Is rich. — That is, rich to bestow
        on both Jews and Gentiles all they need. Calvin is not to be followed in
        explaining the word rich here as meaning ‘kind and beneficent.’ This
        would sanction any abuse of words that the wildest imagination could
        invent. Nor is there any need of such an expedient. The meaning, as here
        explained, is quite obvious. Unto all that call upon Him . — God is able
        to supply the wants of all that call upon Him, and He will supply them.
        All of them receive out of the fullness of Jesus Christ. Here it is
        imported that to call on the name of the Lord is to be a believer. Let
        it then be understood that to call on the Lord implies to call on Him in
        faith as He is revealed in the Gospel. There must be the knowledge of
        God as a just God, and a Savior, before any one can call on Him. To call
        on the Lord in this sense, amounts to the same thing as to believe in
        Christ for salvation, and it implies that every believer is one who
        calls on God. If any man professes to be a believer, and does not
        habitually call on God, he is not what he pretends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
        saved. ‘The context in Joel,’ says Calvin, ‘will fully satisfy us that
        his prediction applies to this passage of Paul.’ But why should we need
        anything to convince us of this, but the authority of the Apostle
        himself? It is a most pernicious method of interpreting the applications
        of the Old Testament in the New, to make our perception of their
        justness the ground of acknowledging the Apostle’s conclusion. It may be
        proper to show how far or how clearly the words of the prophecy
        establish the particular reference made by the Apostle. But whether we
        can explain the application or not, the interpretation of the Apostle is
        as infallible as the prophecy itself. If one will undertake to vindicate
        the justness of the Apostle’s conclusion, another may be inclined to
        question it, and to allege that the prophecy has not the meaning
        assigned to it by the Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here implied, that in order to salvation it is necessary to call
        on the Lord, and that whoever does so shall be saved. Here, as in other
        places of Scripture, the name of the Lord signifies the Lord Himself. By
        calling on the name of the Lord, all the parts of religious worship
        which we render to God are intended. It denotes a full and entire
        communion with God. He who calls on the name of the Lord, profoundly
        humbles himself before God, recognizes His power, adores His majesty,
        believes His promises, confides in His goodness, hopes in His mercy,
        honors Him as his God, and loves Him as his Savior. It supposes that
        this invocation is inseparable from all the other parts of religion. To
        call on the name of the Lord, is to place ourselves under His
        protection, and to have recourse to Him for His aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why does the Prophet ascribe deliverance or salvation to calling on
        the name of the Lord, and not merely say, ‘Whoever calls on God shall be
        heard, shall be protected, shall receive His blessing?’ The reason is,
        that he was treating of the new covenant, which clearly, without a veil
        and without a figure, announces salvation in opposition to the former
        covenant, which held forth temporal blessings. The Gospel speaks plainly
        of salvation, that is to say, of eternal happiness which we should
        expect after death. He uses the term saved, in order to remind us of the
        unhappy condition in which we were by nature, and to show the difference
        between our state and that of angels, for the angels live, but are not
        saved. The life of which Jesus Christ is the fountain, finds us plunged
        in death, lost in ourselves, children of wrath, and it is given us under
        the title of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one ever called upon the Lord, in the Scripture sense of this phrase,
        without being saved. It is here as expressly said, ‘Whosoever shall call
        upon the name of the Lord shall be saved,’ as it is, ‘Whoever believeth
        shall be saved.’ It appears that Paul, when he here speaks of calling
        upon the Lord, refers to the Lord Jesus Christ, whom he had named in the
        9th verse. In the same way he addresses the church at Corinth, ‘With all
        that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In thus calling upon the Lord, a believer, like Enoch, walks with God.
        It is not only that he prays to God at stated seasons; his life is a
        life of prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He prays to God ‘everywhere,’ and ‘always.’ He remembers that Jesus hath
        said, ‘Henceforth I call you not servants; but I have called you
        friends;’ He serves God, therefore, in newness of spirit, and goes to
        Him in all occasions as his covenant God, his Father, and his Friend, to
        whom he pours out his heart, makes known all his wants, difficulties,
        and desires, and consults Him On every occasion in matters great and
        small. From this holy and constant communion he is not at any time or in
        any circumstances precluded. In Nehemiah we have beautiful and
        encouraging examples both of stated and ejaculatory prayer in unforeseen
        circumstances, see ch. 2:4; in short, of a continual appeal to God, ch.
        13:29. Paul commands us to ‘pray without ceasing.’ To the exercise of
        this duty, so frequently enforced by the Lord in His last discourse to
        His disciples, believers have the highest encouragement. ‘Whatsoever ye
        shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you.’ ‘If ye abide in
        Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall
        be done unto you.’ We see, in the sequel, the effect of David’s short
        prayer, ‘O Lord, I pray Thee turn the counsel of Ahithophel into
        foolishness.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Lord shows Himself at all times so ready to answer the
        prayers of His people, yet in the transaction with the Gibeonites,
        Joshua and the elders of Israel ‘asked not counsel at the mouth of the
        Lord,’ and what was the consequence? We are ready to be astonished at
        their conduct in this instance, yet how often is similar negligence or
        unbelief exemplified in the life of every Christian! even after he has
        received, in innumerable instances, gracious answers to his petitions,
        so often reproving his little faith when he presented them; and after he
        has experienced so many distressing proofs of the evil of being left to
        his own counsels when he has neglected this duty, Joshua 9:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14, — How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not
        believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
        and how shall they hear without a preacher?
      </p>
      <p>
        This and the following verse are not the objections of a Jew, as alleged
        by Dr. Macknight. It is all the language of the Apostle in his own
        character.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had said in the preceding verse, that whosoever shall call upon the
        name of the Lord shall be saved. From this he urges the necessity of
        preaching the Gospel to all men; for when it is said that whosoever
        calls on Him shall be saved, it is implied that none shall be saved who
        do not call upon Him. What, then, is the consequence to be drawn from
        this? Is it not that the Gospel should with all speed be published over
        the whole world? If the Gentiles are to be partakers of Divine mercy, it
        is by seeking it from Jesus Christ, who has died that mercy might be
        extended to Jew and Gentile. Is it not by the Holy Ghost speaking to the
        heart of the Gentiles without the instrumentality of the word, that they
        are to be converted and saved. They must hear the word and call on the
        Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whoever is saved by Jesus Christ must call upon Him. How then shall they
        call on Him in whom they have not believed? — If, in order to salvation,
        it be necessary to call on Christ, how can the Gentiles call on Him when
        they do not believe in Him? And how shall they believe in Him of whom
        they have not heard? — This is impossible. In this state were the
        Gentile nations before the Gospel reached them. Hence the great
        importance of communicating to them the glad tidings of salvation. And
        how shall they hear without a preacher? — The Gospel was not to be
        immediately declared by the voice of God from heaven, or by the Holy
        Ghost speaking without a medium of communication, or by angels sent from
        heaven; it was to be carried over the world by men. How, then, according
        to this Divine constitution, could the nations of the earth hear the
        Gospel without a preacher? It is unnecessary to refute the opinion of
        those who hold that the Gospel cannot speak to men savingly in the
        Scriptures, and that it is never effectual without the living voice of a
        preacher. This is not the meaning of the Apostle. His doctrine is, that
        the Gospel must be communicated to the minds of men through the external
        instrumentality of the word, as well as by the internal agency of the
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men are not only saved through Christ, but they are saved through the
        knowledge of Christ, communicated through the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is
        written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of
        peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Gentiles could not believe in the Lord without hearing of Him,
        and if they could not hear of Him unless He was declared to them, then
        it follows, from the prophecy above quoted, that preachers must be sent
        to them. Notwithstanding, then, the violent opposition made to it by the
        Jews, the necessity was manifest for the Apostles, according to their
        Divine commission, to go forth to preach the Gospel to every creature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The accordance of this with the Old Testament Scriptures, Paul had been
        showing, and he now supports it by further quotation. As it is written,
        etc. — This prophecy, Isaiah 52:7, which may literally respect good news
        of deliverance to the Jews from temporal judgments, typically refers, as
        the Apostle’s application of it here shows, to the messengers of mercy
        sent forth under the Gospel. In the beginning of that chapter, Zion or
        Jerusalem, the Church of God, is called to arise from her degraded
        condition, for the Lord has prepared for her deliverance. Then follow
        the words here quoted. The tidings to be told are next subjoined. ‘Thy
        God reigneth.’ That the Gentiles also should partake in the blessings of
        His reign, is immediately intimated. ‘The Lord hath made bare His holy
        arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall
        see the salvation of our God.’ Thus, beginning at Jerusalem, those
        commissioned by the Lord were to preach salvation in His name among all
        nations. In the conclusion of the chapter, the blessed effects under the
        reign of the Messiah are declared. ‘So shall He sprinkle many nations;
        the kings shall shut their mouths at Him; for that which had not been
        told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they
        consider.’ This quotation, then, made by the Apostle, was calculated to
        produce the strongest conviction of the truth he was establishing,
        namely, the duty of preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — But they have not all obeyed the Gospel: for Esaias saith,
        Lord, who hath believed our report?
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here admitted by Paul, that though the Gospel was to be preached
        both to Jews and Gentiles, with the assurance that whosoever believeth
        shall be saved, yet, as a matter of fact, all who heard did not believe
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might seem unaccountable; or it might even appear to be an argument
        against the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, that,
        notwithstanding all the blessings with which it was said to be fraught
        to those who should receive it, it was still rejected by many to whom it
        was preached. But this should not seem strange to any acquainted with
        prophecy: it is the very testimony of Isaiah. Instead, then, of being an
        objection to the preaching of the Gospel, that it was not received by
        the bulk of those who heard it, it was the very thing which the
        Scriptures predicted. The prophecy of Isaiah 53:1, is here applied to
        this fact, in which a plain intimation is given of the small number who
        should receive the Gospel when first preached. If, then, the Jews
        objected to the preaching of the Gospel from this fact, they must object
        to the Prophet Isaiah on the same ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        According, then, to this complaint of the Prophet, it is evident that
        faith comes by hearing, which the Apostle is asserting; and this is the
        consequence to be deduced from it. The word in the preceding verse,
        quoted from Isaiah, and rendered ‘report,’ is the same which in this
        verse is rendered hearing. Faith, then, never comes but by hearing, that
        is, by the word of God. The Apostles communicated their testimony by the
        living voice, and by their writings. Both are comprehended in what is
        called hearing. All this showed the necessity of preaching the Gospel to
        the Gentiles, on which Paul had been insisting, according to which there
        is no such thing as saving faith among heathens who have not heard of
        Christ. Hearing by the word of God. — This makes the last observation
        still stronger. The hearing cannot extend to Dr. Macknight’s scheme of
        salvation to the heathens, who supposes that they may have faith without
        the knowledge of the Gospel; for, consistently with this passage, faith
        must come, not from the revelation of the works of God, but from that of
        His word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — But I say, Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound went
        into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel had now been everywhere preached, Colossians 1:23. The
        Apostle applies to this fact what is said in the nineteenth Psalm. That
        Psalm literally refers to the preaching of the great luminaries of
        heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; but typically it refers to the
        preaching of the word of God. The sun of the creation preaches to all
        nations the existence, the unity, the power, the wisdom, and the
        goodness of God. He speaks in a language all nations may understand. All
        nations, indeed, have departed from the doctrine thus preached; but this
        results from disaffection to the doctrine, and not from the obscurity of
        the language of the preacher. The Apostle tells us that all nations,
        even the most barbarous, are without excuse in their idolatry. God is
        revealed in His character as Creator in the works of His hands, and all
        men should know Him as such. The sun carries the intelligence of God’s
        perfections and existence to every nation under heaven, which are
        successively informed that there is an almighty, all-wise, and
        beneficent Being, the author of all things. In like manner, the Gospel
        of Christ preaches to all nations, and informs them of the glorious
        character of God, as manifested in the incarnation and death of His Son
        Jesus Christ, while it reveals His mercy concerning which the works of
        creation are silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight supposes the question here asked, ‘Have they not heard?’
        to be answered by the preaching of the works of creation, according to
        the words of the Psalm in their literal meaning. This is contrary to the
        whole train of the Apostle’s reasoning, who is speaking of the preaching
        of the Gospel. Even Calvin makes the preaching spoken of in that Psalm
        to refer to the ‘silent works of God’ in ancient times, and not in any
        sense to the preaching of the Apostles. But it is evident that the
        Apostle is not referring to the former, but to the present state of the
        Gentile nations. The words of the Psalmist are thus spiritually, as they
        always have been literally, fulfilled in the preaching of the silent
        works of God. The description in the nineteenth Psalm, of the sun in the
        firmament, has, as above noticed, a strict literal and primary meaning,
        but it is also typical of Him who is called the Sun of Righteousness,
        who by His word is the spiritual light of the world. Paul therefore
        quotes this description in the last sense, thus taking the spiritual
        meaning, which was ultimately intended. This suits his object, while he
        drops the literal, although also a just and acknowledged sense. It is
        not, then, as setting aside the literal application of such passages
        that the Apostles quote them in their spiritual import, nor in the way
        of accommodation, as is so often asserted, to the great disparagement
        both of the Apostles and the Scriptures, but as their ultimate and most
        extensive signification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — But I say, Did not Israel know? First, Moses saith, I will
        provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish
        nation I will anger you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did not Israel know, that they were to be rejected as a nation, and the
        Gentiles called into the Divine favor? That this was communicated in
        their Scriptures is most clear. In the quotation here adduced,
        Deuteronomy 31:21, this event was foretold by Moses, who commences that
        prediction in a way that marks the importance of what he was about to
        say: ‘Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
        words of my mouth.’ In verse 5th, he declares the ingratitude and
        unbelief of Israel. ‘They have corrupted themselves; their spot is not
        the spot of His children; they are a perverse and crooked generation.’
        He continues this complaint to the 20th verse, when he pronounces the
        decree of God of their rejection. ‘I will hide My face from them, I will
        see what their end shall be; for they are a very forward generation,
        children in whom is no faith.’ And then immediately he adds the words
        from which the verse before us is taken. In these words the calling of
        the Gentiles is clearly predicted. The Gentiles are marked by these
        expressions: — 1st , ‘I will move them to jealousy with those which are
        not a people, I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.’ 2nd ,
        Their calling is pointed out by the provocation to jealousy with which
        God threatens the Jews, which intimates that He will bestow His love and
        His covenant on those who were formerly foolish, and will withdraw them
        from Israel. 3rd , This same calling is marked by the comparison drawn
        between that provocation to jealousy with which He threatens Israel,
        with that with which the Israelites have provoked Him. ‘They have moved
        Me to jealousy;’ that is, as they had given their love and their heart
        to others besides God, in the same way God would give His love and His
        heart to others besides them. This prediction, then, could only find its
        accomplishment in the conversion of the Gentiles by the Gospel of Jesus
        Christ. The word ‘nation’ is here a figurative expression in reference
        to God’s dealings with Israel. The Gentiles are called as individuals.
        The ‘righteous nation,’ Isaiah 26:2, is composed of believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
        sought Me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth
        My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Moses predicted, somewhat obscurely, the calling of the Gentiles,
        Isaiah had foretold it very plainly, and placed it in a light most
        offensive to the Jews. In this prophecy, the bringing in of the
        Gentiles, and their ready reception of the Gospel, and at the same time
        the obstinate unbelief of the Jews, notwithstanding the earnest and
        constant invitations of God by His servants, are plainly indicated.
        Nothing could more clearly describe the conduct of the Jews, and the
        reception they gave to the message of salvation, than this prophecy of
        Isaiah. In this and the preceding chapter, the Apostle has fully shown
        that the calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the great body of
        the Jewish nation, had been the purpose of God during the whole of that
        economy which separated the Jews from the rest of the world, and under
        which they had enjoyed such distinguished and peculiar privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in the ninth chapter the sovereignty of God in the rejection of
        the great body of the Jewish nation is Prominently brought into view, in
        the chapter before us their rejection is shown to have been the
        immediate effect of their own unbelief. No truth is more manifest in
        every part of the Old Testament Scriptures, than that contained in the
        declaration just referred to, Isaiah 65:2. All day long I have stretched
        forth My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. — What outward
        means did not God employ to induce the Israelites to love and honor Him,
        and to lead them to submission to His authority! ‘I have hewed them by
        the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth,’ Hosea 6:5. ‘I
        earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up
        out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and
        protesting, saying, Obey My voice,’ Jeremiah 11:7. ‘And now, O
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt
        Me and My vineyard. What could have been done more to My vineyard that I
        have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth
        grapes, brought it forth wild grace?’ Isaiah 5:3. Here, then, is the
        stretching forth of the hands of God to that people all the day long,
        that is, during the whole period of their dispensation; and here the
        complaint is verified of their continuing, notwithstanding, disobedient
        and gainsaying. The fault, then, was their own, and the awful sentence
        that followed, Isaiah 5:5,6, was merited and juSt. In this we see what
        is the result, when God employs only outward means to lead men to
        obedience, and does not accompany them with the influence of His
        efficacious grace. Without this, the Apostle shows in the preceding
        chapter, that the whole nation of Israel, without exception, would have
        been as Sodom and Gomorrah. Here, then, is the condition to which many
        in their wisdom would reduce all mankind, if they could establish their
        unscriptural doctrines in opposition to Divine election and efficacious
        grace. They are displeased at the idea that all the heathen nations were
        left to themselves, while so much favor was shown to Israel; yet we see
        in the case of Israel, in whom so full a display is made of the
        character of man, what would have been the result as to the other
        nations of a similar dispensation of outward means. But, according to
        the system of such cavilers at the clear doctrine of the Scriptures,
        there still remains something good in man, which may lead him, without a
        change of heart, to embrace the glad tidings of salvation. Many of them
        also affirm that man has power to resist and make void the internal
        operation of grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        In support of this last opinion, reference is made to such texts as that
        in Genesis 6:3, where God says, ‘My Spirit shall not always strive with
        man;’ and to the words of Stephen, when he charges the Jews as
        stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, who, like their
        fathers, always resisted the Holy Ghost, Acts 7:51. But the answer is
        easy when we attend to the different aspects in with the grace of God is
        presented in Scripture. Besides its existence in the mind of God, it is
        spoken of either in its manifestation in His word, or in its operation
        in the heart. In its manifestation it may, and, unless accompanied by
        its internal operation, always will, be resisted. To such resistance the
        above passages refer, and give their attestation; and for the truth of
        this we also can appeal not only to the example of the nation of Israel,
        but also to what we see passing before us every day. Multitudes, in the
        enjoyment of the full light of the revelation of grace, continually
        discover their resistance to its manifestation in the word. But not so
        with respect to grace, in its internal operation in the heart. This
        cannot be effectually resisted. On the contrary, so far as it proceeds,
        it takes away all inclination to resist, creating a new heart, and
        making those who are its subjects willing in the day of God’s power,
        <19B003> Psalm 110:3. Here, then, there must be an election by God of
        those who shall thus be favored, without which not one individual would
        be saved. If the doctrine of the fall in its proper extent be admitted,
        the doctrines of election and efficacious grace must be embraced by
        those who do not believe that all men are to be left to perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this chapter we see how highly God values His law. Though the Jews
        had a zeal of God, yet they were rejected, because they attempted to
        substitute their own obedience, which fell short of the demands of the
        law, which requires perfection. In order that any of the human race
        might be saved, it was necessary that the Son of God should fulfill the
        law. He alone is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
        believeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this law of everlasting obligation, under which all mankind were
        placed, it may be proper to make a few general remarks, as well as on
        the covenant with Israel, to which there is also reference in this
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is the Legislator as well as the Creator of the world, and His law
        is necessarily founded on the relation in which He stands to His
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law is a transcript of His character, proclaiming His holiness, His
        justice, and His goodness; in one word, His love, for God is love. The
        sum of it is, ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
        thy neighbor as thyself.’ Thus love is the fulfilling of the law; the
        end of the commandment is love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The love demanded from the creature is primarily for God His Creator,
        the great object of love. The second part of the summary of the law, far
        from opposing, coincides with and flows from the first, commanding us to
        love our neighbor as the creature of God. The love it thus requires of
        us for man is measured by that which we bear to ourselves, and
        consequently teaches that self-love is not to be condemned, unless it be
        excessive or exclusive. It is proper and necessary as a part of the law
        of our creation, which imposes on us the duty of attending to and
        providing for our own wants.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law must necessarily be the law of the whole intelligent creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to its holiness, justice, and goodness, nothing more and
        nothing less can be required of any creature. ‘The law of the Lord is
        perfect.’ In nothing is it deficient; in nothing does it exceed. It
        requires perfect obedience, which is essential to the nature of every
        law; for no law can dispense with the smallest part of the obedience it
        demands. Any work of supererogation, then, is impossible. No creature in
        the universe can do more than love God with all his heart and strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law is enforced by sanctions. These are indispensable in order to
        carry it into execution, and maintain the dignity of the Lawgiver. Both
        the reward of obedience and the punishment of transgression proceed from
        the character of God. God loves Himself and His creatures. He is love
        for Himself above all, being the supreme object of love, and infinitely
        worthy of being loved. He is also love for His creatures, as appears by
        the original situation in which all of them were placed. The angels at
        their creation were the inhabitants of heaven, where God manifests His
        glory. When man was created, the world was provided for him, and adapted
        to his nature; he enjoyed communion with God, and everything around him
        was pronounced to be ‘very good.’
      </p>

        From their happy original situation, a part of the angels and all
        mankind have fallen by disobedience. They broke the perfect bond of
        love, and consequently the unhappiness which proceeds from their
        rebellion against God can only be attributed to themselves. God, who is
        infinite in every perfection, and of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,
        must necessarily punish sin; for sin is the violation of the law of
        love. It separates the creature from God, who is the source of
        happiness; it is rebellion against His just government; and its tendency
        is to produce universal confusion and misery. The love, therefore, of
        God for Himself and for all that is good; His holiness, which places Him
        in infinite opposition to sin; His regard for the honor of His law; and
        His justice, which requires the giving to all what is due, — demand that
        sin should be punished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evil of violating the law of God may be estimated by the punishment
        inflicted on the human race on account of one transgression. That one
        transgression caused the entrance of death, spiritual, temporal, and
        eternal; but by the goodness of God men were immediately placed under a
        dispensation of mercy. Human governments, being imperfect, dispense with
        justice when they extend pardon to a criminal; but this cannot be so
        with God, who, when He shows mercy, acts consistently with justice. He
        remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself. He proclaims Himself to be ‘a
        just God, and a Savior.’ In the plan, then, of mercy and salvation, the
        law is maintained in all its authority, and with all its sanctions. Sin
        is punished, while sinners are saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authority, the majesty, and the sovereignty of God are evidently
        interested in carrying into effect His threatenings and denunciations of
        punishment. If human laws were not executed, it would introduce
        confusion and disorder into families and states; but if the law of God
        were left unexecuted, there would be absolute confusion and disorder
        throughout the universe. The object, therefore, of the law, is an object
        of unspeakable importance, infinitely above that of the laws of men. Its
        immediate end is the manifestation of the holiness and glory of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the law of universal and eternal obligation, the observance of
        other laws was enjoined on the people of Israel, in subserviency to the
        advent of the Messiah, to prefigure that great event, and in order to
        keep them separate from the other nations till He should appear. The
        covenant with Israel consisted of three parts: the first was the moral
        law; the second, the ceremonial; and the third, the judicial or
        political law. The moral law was such as has been already described. The
        ceremonial law consisted of a body of worship and of services, which the
        Israelites were commanded to render to God; and to this belonged all the
        various ordinances, purifications, sacrifices, oblations, celebrations
        of solemn feasts, and observances of days, excepting the seventh day,
        Sabbath, as being a part of the moral law. The judicial law comprehended
        all the regulations enjoined for their social and political conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with these laws, there was vouchsafed a manifestation of the mercy
        of God through the Messiah. This comprehended all the promises of grace
        and salvation, and of the remission of sins, which God gave to the
        Israelites, proclaiming Himself to them as the Lord God, merciful and
        gracious, together with all the exhortations to repent, and have
        recourse to His fatherly goodness. It likewise included all those
        prophecies which foretold the Messiah, and required men to believe and
        place in Him their confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this manifestation of grace and of mercy did not properly
        belong to the legal, but to the evangelical covenant, yet, as it was
        connected under the same ministry with the moral, the ceremonial, and
        the judicial laws, the Scripture includes the whole under the term law;
        the denomination of the ministry being taken from the part that
        predominated. The reason why this revelation of the Gospel was joined
        with the law is obvious. God purposed to save many among the Israelites,
        and to conduct them, as His elect and true children, to life and
        salvation. But this could not be effected by the legal covenant alone;
        for the law made nothing perfect; it was weak through the flesh, and
        could not justify. It was necessary, then, to connect with it a measure
        of the dispensation of the Spirit; and without this, the state of the
        Israelites would have been worse than that of the other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The economy of Moses was not, however, to be permanent. The object of
        the ceremonial law was accomplished, when that came which is called, in
        the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:1, ‘perfection,’ which was the grand
        consummation of all the typical ordinances, by the sacrifice of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that period its use was superseded, and itself abolished. On the
        destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, where alone the sacrifices
        could be offered, and on the expulsion of the Jews from their own land,
        the observance both of the ceremonial and judicial laws became
        impracticable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole Mosaic economy, which had been glorious in itself, was done
        away, and ceased to have any glory by reason of the glory that
        excelleth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral law, however, could never be superseded. Although it formed a
        part of the Mosaic economy, to that economy it did not exclusively
        belong. Under the moral law, as a covenant, man at the beginning had
        been placed and under it, as broken, and pronouncing its curse, all
        unbelievers remain as one with the first man. But from this covenant,
        they who are united to Him by whom it has been fulfilled, are for ever
        freed. According to the energetic language of the Apostle, in the
        seventh chapter of this Epistle, they are ‘dead to the law.’ While dead
        to it, however, as a covenant, whether as to its blessing or its curse —
        justification by it or condemnation — it remains their rule of duty, and
        must for ever continue in force. And that its authority should continue,
        while the other parts of that first covenant were done away, as it had
        existed before that covenant was made, was clearly indicated at its
        first promulgation from Mount Sinai. On that occasion it was strikingly
        distinguished from the other parts of the law. These were delivered to
        Moses, and by him to the people. But the moral law was promulgated by
        the voice of God, and it is said, ‘He added no more.’ While the other
        laws were written in a book by Moses, this law of everlasting obligation
        was written on tables of stone by the finger of God, and it alone was
        deposited in the ark. ‘There was nothing in the ark save the two tables
        of stone,’ 1 Kings 8:9. There, as inscribed on these tables, the law was
        placed under the mercy-seat, which was an eminent type of Him by whom it
        was to be fulfilled. To minister and prepare the way for His appearance
        was the great object in view in the calling of Abraham, in the setting
        apart his descendants as a people from among whom He was to spring, in
        the public proclamation of this law which had been transgressed, and in
        thus depositing it in the ark, and it alone, not even to be looked upon
        till He should come by whom it was fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the third chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, a
        contrast is drawn between the ministration of Moses and that of the
        Apostles, in order to demonstrate the superiority of the latter. The
        ministration committed to Moses is there denominated the ‘letter,’ and
        that committed to the Apostles, the ‘spirit’ — the one written and
        engraved in stones, the other in the fleshly tables of the heart. On the
        ministration of the letter or outward form, in which spiritual blessings
        were veiled under sensible images and carnal ordinances, a degree of
        obscurity remained, called the veil on Moses’ face, so that Israel after
        the flesh could not steadfastly look to the end, or final object, of
        that which was to be abolished. They rested in the observance of the
        ordinances, without considering their grand object, and looked to their
        temporal deliverances, without attending to the spiritual redemption
        which they prefigured. In the same way, what was external to the senses
        in the priesthood and the sacrifices, was all that they regarded. Their
        services were therefore those of the letter, with no discernment of the
        spirit, apart from which these services were a body without a soul. The
        nation of Israel, in general, thus verified the declaration that the
        things of the Spirit of God are foolishness to the natural man; neither
        can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. Not aware of
        the extent of the law which is spiritual, and of the perfect conformity
        required to all its precepts, and relying on the sacrifices they offered
        for the pardon of their transgressions, they sought acceptance by their
        own righteousness. But neither by their obedience could they fulfill the
        demands of the law, nor could the sacrifices remove their guilt, while
        by them they could not obtain peace of conscience, or assure themselves
        of reconciliation with God. The covenant, then, of which Moses was the
        mediator, gendered to bondage. It was the ministration of ‘condemnation’
        and ‘death,’ for ‘the letter killeth.’ The spirit only, which that
        letter veiled, ‘giveth life,’ 2 Corinthians 3:6. Paul denominates the
        ministration committed to him the ministration of righteousness — the
        righteousness of the Messiah; and his lamentation in the chapter before
        us is, that Israel being ignorant of this righteousness, went about to
        establish their own righteousness, not submitting themselves unto the
        righteousness of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction, however, between the letter and the spirit did not
        refer exclusively to the nation of Israel. It related formerly, and has
        done so at every period, to all who, professing to worship God, are
        still in the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral law, as has been observed, had been in force from the
        beginning, as is proved in this Epistle, ch. 5:13; although more fully
        promulgated in the covenant with Israel. But as soon as Adam had
        committed the sin by which it was broken, and all men had thus been
        brought under its condemnation, in pronouncing sentence on him, a
        proclamation of mercy was made, and sacrifices were instituted, which
        indicated the spirit equally with those afterwards enjoined on Israel in
        the ceremonial law. Among the nations, therefore, the true worshippers
        of God — such as Abel, who offered his sacrifice in faith, Enoch, who
        prophesied of the coming of the Lord, Noah, who found grace in the eyes
        of the Lord, Melchizedek, of whom it is particularly recorded, Hebrews
        7:2, that he was first the king of righteousness, and then, or after
        that, also king of peace, and Abraham, who saw the day of Christ, with
        many more — worshipped God in the spirit. The service of all others who
        were ignorant of the true intent and end of the sacrifices, and of that
        righteousness which the Messiah was to bring in, which Noah had
        preached, 2 Peter 2:5, was the service of the letter that ‘killeth.’
        From this the necessity of preaching the Gospel to the nations, on which
        the Apostle so much insists in this chapter, is manifest. The heathens
        have generally retained the form of sacrifice, but, having entirely lost
        sight of the end of that institution, like Israel after the flesh, they
        know nothing beyond the letter which killeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such also is the service of all professed Christians, of whatever name,
        who go about to establish their own righteousness, which is of the law.
        To all men, of every description, who are laboring under the burden of
        sin, our Lord by His Gospel, wherever it reaches, proclaims, as formerly
        to Israel, Come unto Me and I will give you rest; thus extending to them
        the ministration, not of condemnation, but of righteousness, — not of
        the letter that killeth, but of the spirit that giveth life. He Himself
        is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty, 2
        Corinthians 3:17. ‘It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
        nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
        life.’ ‘If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free
        indeed.’
