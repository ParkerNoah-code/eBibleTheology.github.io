      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
        weak, and not to please ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        WE then that are strong. — The Apostle continues here to treat of the
        subject of mutual forbearance among Christians, raking himself with
        those who are strong in the faith, and who know that under the new
        covenant there is no longer any distinction in the sight of God between
        different kinds of meat, or any sanctity in the feast days enjoined to
        be observed under the Jewish dispensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To know the mind of God, as revealed in the Scriptures, is to be strong;
        to be ignorant of it, is to be weak. It is not the man of the greatest
        intellectual vigor who is strong, nor the imbecile in understanding who
        is weak. Many of those who possess the greatest talents, and are most
        distinguished for mental acquirements, even although Christians, may be
        weak in respect to the things of God. And many who are of feeble
        intellect, may be strong in the knowledge of Divine things. Ought to
        bear the infirmities of the weak. — Mr. Stuart explains the word here
        used as signifying ‘to bear with, to endure patiently, to tolerate.’ The
        word, indeed, denotes both to bear and to bear with; but here it is
        evidently to be taken in the former signification. The allusion is to
        travelers assisting a weak companion, by taking a part of his burden and
        carrying it for him. The strong believer is to carry the weak believer’s
        burden, by acting as if he had the same weakness, and abstaining from
        whatever would cause the weak brother to sin. Strictly speaking, it is
        improper to speak of one believer bearing with, enduring, or tolerating
        the opinions of another, for over these he has no control. God only is
        the Lord of the conscience. The man who speaks of tolerating the belief
        of another speaks improperly. And not to please ourselves. — If there be
        not a spirit of love, there will be a proneness in men to bring forward,
        and to urge with vehemence anything in which they have received more
        light than their brethren. This is not for the good of their weak
        brethren, but to please themselves, and discover their own superior
        acquirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — Let every one of us please his neighbor for His good to
        edification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let every one of us please his neighbor. — Though no part of the truth
        of God is to be sacrificed to peace, yet everything consistent with
        truth ought to be done to avoid giving offense, or stumbling weak
        brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some persons seem to value themselves on their setting at naught the
        opinion of their brethren; but this we see is far from the doctrine of
        the Apostle. We are not to gratify our own humor, but to do everything
        in our power, consistent with our duty, to please our brother. For his
        good. — Mr. Stuart renders this ‘ in respect to that which is good,’ or
        ‘so far as we may do so and do what is good.’ The common version is
        preferable, and conveys the true meaning. We are to please our brethren
        only for their good. It is for their good not to be urged to do what
        they cannot do with a good conscience; but it is not for their good to
        have any part of the will of God concealed from them. Besides, to
        abstain from meats is not a good in itself. To edification. — This is
        the way in which it is for their good to treat them in the manner
        recommended. It is for their edification. Such treatment will convince
        them of the love of those by whom they are so treated, and will be the
        surest way to lead them forward to clearer views in the points in which
        they are ignorant. To urge them forward with dictatorial zeal, would
        shut their eyes closer, and prevent them from perceiving the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For even Christ pleased not Himself, but, as it is written,
        The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me.
      </p>
      <p>
        For even Christ pleased not Himself — The Apostle confirms his
        injunctions by the example of Christ. He did not please Himself, or look
        for the favor of men; but instead of this, voluntarily acted in such a
        way as to subject Himself to every inconvenience and evil for the good
        of His people. If, then, our Lord Himself acted in this manner, how does
        it condemn a contrary practice in His people, if they indulge their own
        humor at the expense of those for whom Christ died! But, as it is
        written. — Instead of directly referring to the history of the life of
        Christ, the Apostle refers to the Old Testament, which testified of Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chief facts in the life of Christ were in one way or other
        predicted, and foreshown in the law and the Prophets. The manner in
        which they are quoted by the Apostle at once shows their bearing, and
        attests their application to the great Antitype. The actions of our Lord
        were ordered in such a manner as to fulfill what was written concerning
        Him. The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me. — The
        reproaches of those who reproached His Father fell upon His
        only-begotten Son when He was in the world. This imports that all the
        reproaches cast upon God’s people, on account of their obedience to God,
        are really directed against God Himself. It imports that all the
        opposition made to Christ was really opposition to His Father. The
        reason why Christ was so much hated and opposed was, because He revealed
        or manifested the Father. Had He avoided this, He would have been
        applauded by the world. Men, even the most wicked, approve of morality
        and acts of kindness to the human race. They hate Christ and Christians
        only because of their holding forth the character of God, which they
        dislike. Had Christ sought to please Himself, He would have avoided
        whatever excited the enmity of the multitude. When, therefore, the
        people reproached Him, because He pleased His Father and declared His
        will, it was His Father whom they reproached. The great aim of the
        intercourse of Jesus Christ with men, as it referred to them, was their
        good, and not His own pleasure. He bore the infirmities of the weak,
        accommodating His instructions to the capacities of those whom He
        addressed. But because of this condescension He was reproached by
        others. When He was found in company with the ignorant, to teach them,
        He was reproached as ‘a friend of publicans and sinners.’ This appears
        to be the meaning and application of this quotation, which at first
        sight does not seem clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
        our learning; that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures,
        might have hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
        learning. — This observation appears to refer to the Apostle’s reason
        for making the preceding quotation. He might have referred, as already
        remarked, immediately to the history of the life of Christ; but instead
        of this, he quotes from a passage in the Psalm. Here he justifies his
        doing this, and makes an observation which applies generally to the Old
        Testament and shows us in what manner we ought to use it. Some persons
        have blasphemously said that the Old Testament is now out of date. But
        the writers of the New Testament give no such view of the Old. Instead
        of this, they refer to it as proof, and treat it as of constant use to
        the people of God. All that is therein written, whether history, types’
        prophecies, precepts, or examples, although under another dispensation,
        is intended for the instruction of believers, to train them to patience,
        and to impart the consolation which the Scriptures provide for those
        that have hope in God. ‘take, my brethren,’ says James, ‘the prophets,
        who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering
        affliction, and of patience.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage quoted in the preceding verse is not only useful to us, as
        applicable to Christ, but it is, as the Apostle shows, useful as an
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the reproaches of those who reproached God fell upon Christ, the
        people of God ought to live and act in such a manner as the Apostle
        elsewhere enjoins, when he says ‘Let us go forth, therefore, unto Him
        without the camp, bearing His reproach.’ If Christ did not please
        Himself, neither ought His people to please themselves, but to please
        Him and His people for their edification. That we through patience and
        comfort of the Scriptures. — Mr. Stuart understands this of our
        patience, and translates the second word by admonition or exhortation:
        ‘That through patience, and by the exhortation of the Scriptures, we
        might obtain hope. But it is through the patience exhibited in example
        in the Scriptures that we are to have hope. And though the original word
        signifies exhortation as well as comfort, yet here the latter is to be
        preferred. In the next verse, with reference to this declaration, God is
        called the God of patience. Now God is the God of consolation, that is,
        the God who is the author of consolation to His people. But to call God
        the God of exhortation, would be an uncouth expression. Might have hope.
        — We ought to read the Scriptures with a view not to gratify our
        curiosity, but to increase and nourish our hope of future glory. This
        passage teaches that we should encourage ourselves by the example of
        those who, amidst similar temptations, have overcome. For this purpose,
        the conduct of those who obtained a good report through faith is set
        before us, that we may not be slothful, but followers of them who,
        through faith and patience, inherit the promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
        like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the God of patience and consolation. — The Apostle having in the
        preceding verse spoken of the patience and consolation which the
        Scriptures communicate, here designates God as the God of patience and
        consolation, and prays to Him, who is infinitely patient, and the source
        of all consolation, to grant that the believers at Rome might be
        like-minded.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is called the God of patience and consolation, because He is the
        author of patience and consolation to His people. Patience is essential
        to a Christian, and so is consolation; but neither in himself nor from
        any other source, but from God, has he these graces. We cannot bear the
        evils of the cross without Divine support. The virtues, then, of the
        Christian character are as much the fruit of the Spirit of God as faith
        is His gift. Everything good in the man of God is of God: all his sins
        are his own. When, therefore, we are in straits, difficulties, or
        troubles, we ought to look to God for patience to bear what He may see
        good to lay upon us, and for consolation under the burden. The form of
        the expression, God of patience, shows not only that God gives patience
        to His people, but that He gives it abundantly, and that there is no
        other source of this gift. Grant you to be like-minded — Mr. Stuart
        understands the expression translated like-minded to relate to matters
        of belief. It is true that it has this signification, but it is equally
        true that it refers to the will and affections, and in this place, in
        accordance with the common version, it is to be so understood. There may
        be unity of sentiment in error, as well as in truth. Christians should
        labor to effect union of belief in all matters, because it is their duty
        to endeavor to know whatever God has revealed, and not merely for the
        purpose of union of sentiment, in order to walk together in church
        fellowship. It is true that union of belief in all things tends much to
        harmony; but it is likewise true that difference of sentiment in some
        things tends more to manifest the degree of advancement in the things of
        God. There may be harmony from perfect agreement in belief, when there
        is not only error, but little of the true principle of harmony; for the
        true principle of harmony is love to Christ’s people for Christ’s sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also true that if we look to the New Testament, we do not always
        find perfect agreement in sentiment among the brethren. Although,
        therefore, the thing is desirable, it is not always to be expected, and
        much less is it to be made a term of communion. Christians are to walk
        together in the things in which they are agreed, and to differ without
        condemning each other. This is quite consistent with every degree of
        zeal for the interest of every truth about which they may differ,
        Philippians 3:15,16. If there be any who think that union of sentiment
        among Christians is not highly desirable, they are certainly far
        mistaken, and not of the same mind with the Apostle, who shows such
        earnestness on that subject. For surely it is desirable that Christians
        should know all that God has revealed; and if they know this, they will
        have this unity. But a thing may be very desirable which is not
        essential to their fellowship, and, as a matter of fact, no two
        Christians have such an union of sentiment. There are among them babes,
        young men, and fathers, and they are of the same mind about Divine
        things, just as far as they are respectively taught by the Spirit. The
        faith of Christ is required absolutely in all who have a right to
        fellowship in a church of Christ; but fellowship is not to be refused to
        him whom we acknowledge that Christ has received According to Christ
        Jesus. — Mr. Stuart understands this as meaning ‘in accordance with the
        Spirit of Christ, or agreeably to what Christ or the Christian religion
        requires.’ It undoubtedly means, according to the example of Christ
        Jesus, and accords with the expression, ‘Let this mind be in you which
        was also in Christ Jesus,’ Philippians 2:5. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight understands it of the example of Christ, but he also includes
        the will of Christ. But these two meanings the phrase cannot have in the
        same place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — That ye may wish one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
        Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        That ye may with one mind and one mouth. — With one mind means
        accordance in affection and heart. Union of affection is much more
        necessary to harmony in worship than perfect harmony in sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be harmony in the service of God among Christians who differ
        upon many things. But if any two of them are disaffected to one another,
        there is no harmony, though they should both have perfectly the same
        judgment in all matters. It is in this view that the Apostle charges
        Euodias and Syntyche that they should be of the same mind. Disaffection
        towards each other was the evil under which they labored, and not
        difference about any matter of belief. One mouth. — That is, this
        harmony should be as complete as if they all uttered their voice through
        one mouth. It is delightful to see a body of Christians all uniting in
        prayer and praise with one heart, while there may be a great variety in
        their attainments in the knowledge of Christ. On the other hand, there
        may be a professed union in everything, without having the mind that
        Christ here requires. The union of Christians in professed faith will
        not compensate for their want of union in Him. Glorify God. — God is
        glorified in the prayers and praises of His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This object, then, they should never forget. They should acknowledge Him
        and praise Him in every part of His character, however offensive it may
        be to the world. He is glorified by them literally with one mouth in
        prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He who prays is to be considered as uttering the prayer of the whole
        multitude of disciples, and each of them should follow in spirit,
        praying with him as he utters the words. Even the Father of our Lord
        Jesus Christ. — God is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He
        is the God of Christ as man, and He is the Father of Christ as God. The
        titles Father and Son, as applied to Christ and His heavenly Father,
        most evidently apply to relation in Godhead. Great efforts have been
        made by some to overturn this view; but their efforts have been without
        success, and they have been most mischievous in taking away one of the
        strongest proofs of the deity of Christ and one which the Scriptures
        most frequently use. The dignity of the character of Christ is most
        frequently asserted in calling Him the Son of God. But if He be the Son
        of God in a lower sense, or one corresponding with that in which it is
        applicable to every good man, no definite view of His character is given
        when He is called the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Wherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us to
        the glory of God . Wherefore. — That is, since Christians ought not to
        please themselves, but to act in everything for the edification of each
        other, they ought to receive one another, notwithstanding differences of
        sentiment among them. Receive. — Mr. Stuart understands this as
        signifying to show kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the word means only receive. It expresses nothing of kindness. It
        refers to the reception of each other as Christians to the fellowship of
        the Church. They ought, indeed, to manifest kindness with respect to all
        who are thus received, but the word does not express this. This method
        of giving, as is thought, a more emphatic meaning to words than usually
        belongs to them, is attended with the worst effects. Here it conceals a
        most important part of the will of God respecting the grounds or which
        Christians should receive each other to church fellowship. The command
        to receive into fellowship is turned into a command to show kindness. As
        Christ also received us. — The manner in which Christians are to receive
        one another to church fellowship is as Christ has received them. As, or
        according as. — Now Christ has received, and does receive, all who
        believe the truth even in the feeblest manner. He accepts those who have
        the lowest degree of faith in Him. Thus He received the afflicted
        father, who said, ‘Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.’ Christ
        receives those who are ignorant of many things — indeed of everything
        but faith in Himself. The most ungodly is saved by Him the moment he
        believes; and Christians are received by Him, and live upon Him by
        faith, while they are in error as to many parts of His will. If Christ
        receives His people, notwithstanding their ignorance of many parts of
        His will, ought they to reject those whom He hath received? To the glory
        of God. — Some understand this of the glory which God shall bestow upon
        His people. But this cannot be the meaning here, as we are not yet
        received to His glory; whereas the glory here spoken of is already
        manifested. The glory which God will confer upon His people is future.
        ‘By whom, also, we have access by faith into this grace wherein we
        stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God,’ Romans 5:2. We have
        present access into the favor and grace of God, but we have now only the
        glory of God in hope. The glory of God, then, here means the glory that
        belongs to God’s character. It is to the glory of God that Christians
        are received and saved by His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
        for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I say. — The Apostle proceeds to reconcile the Jews and Gentiles to
        each other, by showing them the reason why Jesus Christ, who was equally
        the Lord of the Jews and the Gentiles, was born a Jew, as a minister of
        the circumcision. Jesus Christ was made under the law and ministered
        among the Jews; and though He gave some examples of His purpose of mercy
        to the Gentiles, yet He did not go out to preach to the nations. But
        this exclusive service among the Jews is not to be understood as
        indicating an exclusion of His mercy from the nations. It was for the
        truth of God. It was to fulfill the predictions and promises of
        Scripture, to confirm the promises made to the fathers. His ministry was
        the fulfillment of the promises that God had made to His ancient
        servants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy; as it
        is written, For this cause I will confess to Thee among the Gentiles,
        and sing unto Thy name.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy. — Though Christ’s
        personal ministry was limited to the Jews, yet the efficacy of His work
        was not confined to them. The Old Testament itself contains evidence
        that the Gentiles were to be interested in His redemption. It was the
        purpose of Christ’s work that Gentiles as well as Jews might glorify God
        on account of His mercy. The glory of God is therefore exhibited as the
        reason of Christ’s work. This is the highest object of all God’s works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salvation is also represented as mercy. There is nothing here or
        anywhere else in Scripture to encourage the presumption of men who
        suppose that they can merit salvation by their own works. Salvation is
        of mercy. In the preceding verse, Paul had spoken of the truth of God:
        here he speaks of His mercy. That which was truth to the Jews, having
        been promised to their fathers, was mercy to the Gentiles, who were
        admitted to participate in the blessings promised. This the Apostle
        proves by the different passages he quotes, which declare that the mercy
        of God was to be extended to all nations. Consequently both Jews and
        Gentiles had the strongest reasons thus presented to them neither to
        condemn nor to despise one another, but, on the contrary, to regard
        themselves united in Christ Jesus, as well as by the common sentiment of
        their obligations to Him, and the love He had shown them. ‘He is our
        peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of
        partition between us.’ As it is written. — Paul quotes a passage from
        the Old Testament to show that Christ was to be the Savior of the
        Gentiles as well as of the Jews. For this cause, etc. — In the passage
        referred to, Christ is represented as confessing or acknowledging God
        among the Gentiles, and singing to the praise of His name. Christ did
        not appear personally among the Gentile nations. This prediction, then,
        must be fulfilled of Him in His people, as one with Him. Than this
        nothing more clearly proves the unity of Christ and His people. What He
        does for them, they do, as they are one with Him. It is thus that
        believers are saved in righteousness as well as in mercy. Christ’s
        righteousness is their righteousness, because they are one with Him.
        Those who repudiate the doctrine of imputation of Christ’s
        righteousness, as both Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart have done, and that
        in a manner the most explicit and unreserved, not merely corrupt, but
        utterly overthrow the Gospel, and entirely remove the grounds of the
        justice of the Divine procedure in the plan of redemption. Grace reigns
        through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. In
        the eighteenth Psalm David speaks of himself, and the things spoken are
        applicable to him; yet the Apostle here quotes the words as applicable
        to Christ. This shows most incontrovertibly that David was a type of
        Christ, and that what is spoken of the type is in its ultimate sense
        spoken of the Antitype.

        Ver. 10. — And again He saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        And again He saith. — That is, God saith this, but it was Moses that
        said it, therefore what Moses here said was dictated by God. The words
        are the words both of God and of Moses. Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His
        people. — This quotation is from Deuteronomy 32:43. The Gentiles are
        there called upon to rejoice in fellowship with the people of God. This
        implies that they were to be converted by the Gospel, and united with
        the Jews in the Church of Christ. Calvin says, ‘I do not agree with
        those who consider this quotation to be taken from the song of Moses;
        for the Jewish lawgiver intends, in that part of his writings, rather to
        strike terror into the adversaries of Israel, than to invite them to the
        participation of one common joy. I take it, therefore, from Psalm
        67:3,4.’ But this is a very unsafe and presumptuous mode of reasoning.
        We must rest on Paul’s authority, rather than on the authority of
        Calvin, as to what was the intention of Moses in the passage quoted.
        Though Moses intended to strike terror into the enemies of Israel, there
        is no reason why Gentile believers should be terrified with this, or
        should not rejoice with the Jewish people of God in the victories of the
        Messiah over His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The perfect applicability of the quotation is clearly obvious. Besides,
        the passage alleged by Calvin as the quotation, namely, Psalm 67:3,4,
        cannot without violence be made to correspond with the words of Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why desert a passage where the words are easily found, and have recourse
        to a passage where the words are not found? Is this to be done on the
        strength of our own views of the words of Moses? Surely we ought
        implicitly to bow to the authority of Paul as a commentator on Moses. In
        fact, the quotation is as applicable to the Gentiles as to the Jews. In
        the typical sense of the passage, are not the Gentiles as much
        interested in the extension of salvation to the nations as the Jews? Are
        they not much more so? Is it not to them a matter of much greater joy?
        The Jews ought, indeed, to rejoice in the glory of God and the happiness
        of men in the extension of the Gospel. But the Gentiles, in addition to
        this, rejoice in it as their own salvation. Even in the literal sense,
        as applicable to the victories of Israel over their enemies, ought not
        believing Gentiles to have rejoiced in them?
      </p>
      <p>
        Did not Rahab rejoice in the victories of Israel over their enemies?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laud Him,
        all ye people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This quotation is from <19B701> Psalm 117:1. It calls upon all the
        nations to praise God. This implies that salvation was to extend to all
        nations, for none can praise God without the knowledge of God. Such
        addresses to the Gentiles are very numerous in the Book of Psalm, and
        refute the opinion of those who think it wrong to call on sinners to
        praise God. It is true that none but believers can praise God. But
        sinners may be called on to perform every duty incumbent on men, and
        charged with guilt for neglecting it. They ought to praise God. But this
        praise ought to be in faith, as well as every other duty. To suppose
        that sinners are not bound to praise God, is to suppose that their
        neglect of this and any other duty is not criminal. There is no danger
        in calling on sinners to observe the whole law of God, if it be also
        kept in view that no obedience in any degree can be given to God except
        through faith in His Son. This is quite a different thing from making
        prayer and praise a preparatory process to conversion. ‘The original
        word,’ says Dr. Macknight, ‘signifies to praise by singing,’ Luke 2:13.
        This is unsound criticism, and proceeds on a false canon, namely, that a
        word designates everything to which it is applicable. Words may apply to
        many things which are not designed by them. This word applies to praise
        by signing, but it does not express singing, because it also applies to
        praise in any manner.

        Ver. 12. — And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
        He that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in Him shall the Gentiles
        trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        And again, Esaias saith. — The Apostle has in this place given
        multiplied quotations from the Old Testament to prove the point in hand.
        One proof from Scripture, if applicable, is sufficient to prove
        anything, yet the Apostle gives us many. This shows that Divine truth
        ought to be exhibited to gainsayers in all its strength, with a display
        of all its evidence. In proportion as prejudice is opposed to any truth,
        it is necessary to fortify it with multiplied evidence. The Jews were
        greatly prejudiced against that part of the will of God which the
        Apostle now teaches, and he heaps scripture upon scripture to overcome
        their prejudices, although his own authority and his own declaration
        were as valid as those of the inspired writers whom he quoted. There
        shall be a root of Jesse. — Rather, there shall be the root of Jesse. It
        is a definite allusion to one particular person of the family of Jesse.
        Christ is called a branch in the same chapter, Isaiah 11; but He appears
        here to be called the root, or a particular shoot from the root, as He
        is elsewhere called a root out of a dry ground. This limits the origin
        of the human nature of the Messiah to the family of Jesse. And He that
        shall rise to reign over the Gentiles. — This determines the Messiah to
        be the King of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews. The passage quoted
        speaks of Him as a banner to the Gentiles. This the Apostle interprets
        as a rule r; because soldiers follow the banner of their captain. In Him
        shall the Gentiles trust. — This strictly asserts that the Gentiles
        would trust in the Messiah descended from Jesse.

        Ver. 13. — Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
        believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy
        Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the God of hope. — God is called the God of hope, because He is the
        author of all the well-grounded hope of His people. All hope of which He
        is not the author, in the heart of men, is false and delusive. The world
        in general may have hope, but it is false hope. All true hope with
        respect to the Divine favor is effected in the human heart by God
        Himself. Not only is God the author of all true hope, but He can create
        this hope out of the midst of despair. The most desponding are often
        raised by Him to a good hope through grace; and the most guilty are in a
        moment relieved, and made to hope in His mercy. How remarkably was this
        the case with the thief on the cross, and with the three thousand on the
        day of Pentecost! Fill you with all joy and peace. — The inward joy and
        peace of the Christian are the gifts of God, and not the natural effects
        of anything in the mind of man. All the promises and declarations of
        Scripture would fail in producing joy and peace in the mind of a sinner,
        were it not for the agency of the Spirit of God. If the Christian
        possesses joy and peace, he ought to ascribe it altogether to God. He
        ought to reflect that these blessings must be produced and continually
        maintained by Divine power, and not by any power of his own mind. It
        should always be kept in view that these fruits of the Spirit, first of
        joy, and next of peace, Galatians 5:22, cannot be produced except in
        connection with the other fruits of the Spirit, and in the way of
        obedience, and in carefully abstaining from grieving the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        David, when he had sinned, having lost his joy in God, utters this
        prayer: ‘Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with
        Thy free Spirit: then will I teach transgressors Thy ways’ Psalm 51:12.
        Here we may also observe that they who seek to teach transgressors the
        ways of God should first themselves have the experience of these ways.
        Fill you. — This implies that there are degrees of joy and peace in the
        minds of Christians. Some may have a measure of these graces who do not
        abound in them. It is a great blessing to be filled with them; and for
        this blessing the Apostle prays with respect to the Christians at Rome.
        If there be different degrees of joy and peace, how important is it to
        look earnestly to God for the fullest communication of these blessings!
        The Psalmist had more joy in his heart, bestowed by God, than worldly
        men have when their corn and wine most abound. In believing glory and
        peace, as well as all other spiritual blessings, are communicated by God
        through faith, and through faith only, and in proportion to faith.
        Faith, when spoken of without peculiar reference, means faith in Christ,
        and not, as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight understands it, faith in any particular promise.. That ye may
        abound in hope. — The above blessings the Apostle prayed for to be
        bestowed on those whom he addressed, in order that they might abound in
        hope; and the more believers are filled with joy and peace the greater
        will be their hope. The people of God have high hopes, and it is their
        privilege to seek from their Lord an increase and abundance of hope —
        not that faint and common hope of possibility or probability but a
        certain hope. Such a hope springs from faith, — in effect, is one with
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith rests upon the goodness and truth of Him who hath promised; and
        hope, raising itself upon faith so established, stands up and looks out
        to the future accomplishment of the promise. Through the power of the
        Holy Ghost. — Hope is produced in the mind by the agency and power of
        the Spirit of God. Here two persons of the Godhead are brought into view
        as each being the bestower of this gift. The Father gives hope — He is
        the God of hope; but He gives it through the Holy Ghost. In the economy
        of redemption, this is the province of the Holy Ghost. Hope is natural
        to the mind of man; and, in general, men have hope in the worst of
        times. But as to Divine things, hope is not natural to man: it is the
        fruit of the Spirit of God through faith in His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prayer contained in this verse reminds us that there is no blessing
        which does not come to us from God, James 1:17. He is called the God of
        love, of peace, of patience, of consolation, of hope, who fills His
        people with joy and peace. If, then, we desire to be filled with joy and
        peace, we must look to God. If we desire to abound in hope by the power
        of the Holy Ghost, we must with confidence pray to obtain His sacred
        influences and Divine teaching. We must be careful not to grieve Him by
        our evil conduct and evil desires.
