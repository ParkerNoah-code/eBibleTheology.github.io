      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil,
        cleave to that which is good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let love be without dissimulation. — There seems to be here an indirect
        allusion to those hollow pretensions of love so generally manifested in
        society. Men pretend to have the greatest love to each other, when they
        not only have no love at all, but when they may really be under the
        influence of a contrary disposition. Calvin well observes on this
        passage. ‘It is difficult to give a view of the ingenuity with which a
        large portion of mankind assume the appearance of that love which they
        really do not possess. For they not only deceive others, but impose upon
        themselves, while they endeavor to believe that they entertain a very
        considerable share of love, even for those whom they not only treat with
        neglect, but in reality renounce and despise. Paul therefore declares
        that only to be genuine love which is free from all dissimulation and
        guile; and every person can best Judge for himself whether he entertains
        any feeling in the innermost recesses of his heart opposed to this noble
        and lasting affection.’ Christians ought to be careful that, while they
        use to each other the endearing language of brethren, they feel the
        sentiments and perform the actions which this language imports. ‘Above
        all things,’ says the Apostle Peter, ‘have fervent charity (love) among
        yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.’ Believers
        ought to throw the mantle of love over the numerous faults into which
        their brethren may fall, in their conduct towards them, and thus to hide
        them from their eyes, forgiving their faults, even as God, for Christ’s
        sake, hath forgiven them, Ephesians 4:32. Abhor that which is evil;
        cleave to that which is good. — With respect to this, Calvin observes,
        ‘The words following in the context, good and evil, have not a general
        meaning; but by evil is intended that malicious iniquity which injures
        any person; and by good, that kindness by which are afforded to others
        aid and assistance.’ But it rather appears that the words in this place
        are to be viewed as to what is bad and good in general. We ought not
        only to avoid doing what is evil, but to accustom ourselves to abhor it,
        as the vilest and most offensive of things are abhorred To what which is
        good we ought to cling with all our hearts. Christians are not to be
        satisfied with abstaining from what is evil, and practicing what is
        good.
      </p>
      <p>
        The affections of their minds should be in unison with their duty; they
        should hate as well as avoid what is sinful, and love as well as
        practice what is good. We thus learn that we are accountable to God for
        the state of our minds, as well as for our external conduct. We should
        not only not practice, but not love evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
        honor preferring one another; Be kindly affectioned one to another with
        brotherly love. — This appears to indicate; that in brotherly love
        believers ought to have that affection for one another which nature
        displays among those who are brothers in the flesh. Brotherhood in
        Christians ought not to be a mere name, but a reality, evinced by the
        affections of a relationship of kindred. All Christians are brethren;
        they are born of one Father, who hath taught them to say, ‘Our Father,
        who art in heaven.’ He who loves the Father, loves the Brethren.
        ‘Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God; and every
        one that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of
        Him.’ In honor preferring one another. — Among those who derive the same
        meaning from these words, there is a great variety in their method of
        expressing it. Calvin, with many others, understood it as our
        translators, that each in honor prefer his brother to himself, agreeably
        to other texts of Scripture. But the word signifies, in general, to lead
        before, and has a great variety of applications. The meaning here seems
        to be, that in showing mutual respect they ought each to strive to take
        the lead. This is a thing in which they may lawfully strive with one
        another. While the men of the world are striving to outstrip each other
        in everything that respects ambition, Christians are to refrain from
        following their example; but they are permitted and enjoined to strive
        with one another in the indication of mutual respect. Dr. Macknight
        understands the passage to mean, ‘In every honorable action go before,
        and lead on one another.’ But it seems forced to understand ‘honor’ as
        signifying every honorable action. The word appears to have a limited
        reference to the honor to be shown to one another by the brethren. — ’In
        lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than himself,’
        Philippians 2:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the
        Lord; Not slothful in business. — It does not appear that the word in
        the original can bear to be translated business. It denotes eagerness,
        earnestness, zeal, urgency, etc. The meaning appears to be, that in
        doing everything with respect to things both temporal and spiritual
        believers are not to be slothful or indulge in indolence; but in every
        duty to use exertion and manifest earnestness. Fervent in Spirit. — A
        fervent spirit is the reverse of sloth, and always prompts to diligence
        and vigor of action. Christians ought to possess such a spirit in doing
        all their business, especially in the things of the Lord. Earnestness in
        doing good, says Calvin, requires a zeal and ardor, lighted up in our
        breasts by the Spirit of God, Acts 18:25. Serving the Lord — Christians
        are here exhorted to consider themselves as the servants or slaves of
        the Lord Jesus Christ. They are so in the fullest sense of the word as
        concerns Christ’s right to them, and authority over them, and the duty
        of their being solely devoted to Him. They have none of the disagreeable
        feelings of slavery, because Christ’s service is their delight, their
        honor, and their interest. Though the precept applies generally, yet it
        appears to have a particular reference, from the connection to the duty
        of fervency of spirit which precedes it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians should consider themselves as wholly and at all times the
        servants of the Lord, and, remembering that His eye is ever upon them,
        do all things as in His presence. It is not merely in acts of worship,
        or on particular occasions, that they are to be considered as serving
        Him, but in all their lives and all their actions. They are in their
        worldly employments and engagements to do all with a view to the
        authority of their Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in eating and drinking, they are exhorted by the Apostle to act for
        the glory of God. If Christians would keep this at all times before
        their minds, how much would their happiness be increased! For we may be
        assured that an increase in our obedience to our heavenly Master will
        always be accompanied with an increase of true happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant
        in prayer; Again and again it is enjoined on believers to rejoice in the
        Lord — in the contemplation of His person, His offices, His power, His
        love, and in their union with Him. Here, in the midst of exhortations to
        attend to various duties, they are commanded to rejoice in hope. Hope is
        founded on faith, and faith on the Divine testimony. Hope, then,
        respects what God has declared in His word. We are here exhorted to
        exercise hope with respect to future glory, and to rejoice in the
        contemplation of the objects of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        What can be better calculated to promote joy than the hope of obtaining
        blessings so glorious in a future world? Were this hope kept in lively
        exercise, it would raise believers above the fear of man and a concern
        for the honors of this world. It would also enable them to despise the
        shame of the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objects, then, of the believer’s hope are the spiritual and
        celestial: blessings which are yet future, to which his eyes should
        constantly be directed, and which are calculated to fill him with the
        greatest joy. It is not the prospect of terrestrial possessions in which
        he is to rejoice, but of a house eternal in the heavens. ‘In Thy
        presence is fullness of joy; at Thy right hand there are pleasures for
        evermore.’ It is that glorious communion with Jesus Christ of which the
        Apostle speaks, when he says, ‘Having a desire to depart, and to be with
        Christ; which is far better.’ It is that state in which believers shall
        be like Him, for they shall see Him as He is. ‘As for me, I will behold
        Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with Thy
        likeness.’ It is the hope of righteousness for which through the Spirit,
        believers wait, Galatians 5:5. This hope is founded on the unchangeable
        promise of God — on His promise accompanied by His oath — on the blood
        of Christ with which He has sealed His promise — on Him who was not only
        dead, but is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
        maketh intercession for His people. This hope, then, is both sure and
        steadfast, and entereth into that within the vail, whither the
        forerunner, even Jesus, is for us entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        This description of hope, as an anchor both sure and steadfast, confutes
        the erroneous doctrine of Roman Catholics, who maintain, as has been
        formerly observed, that the hope of the Gospel is a doubtful conjecture,
        instead of a firm expectation of future blessedness. They insist that
        the believer ought to be always in doubt as to his salvation; that he
        cannot know whether God loves or hates him; and that all the assurance
        he can have of His salvation can never go beyond conjecture. Is this,
        then, the anchor both sure and steadfast which enables the believer to
        remain firm amidst the storms and agitations of this unsettled world?
        Can he rejoice in a hope so uncertain and unstable? That Roman Catholics
        should thus reduce to doubt and uncertainty that hope which the believer
        is commanded to maintain perfectly ( 1 Peter 1:13), is not to be
        wondered at, since it is partly on their own merits, and on the
        satisfaction and sufferings of their saints, that their hope is founded,
        and not exclusively on the blood of Christ. The believer is here
        commanded to rejoice in hope; and if he consider that he is bound to
        apply to himself the other injunctions contained in this portion of the
        word of God, and to act upon them, he ought equally to regard it as his
        duty to obey this injunction, and to remember that, if he is not obeying
        it, it is an indication that all is not right with him. The same
        conclusion may also be drawn, if he is not walking according to that
        other express command in chapter sixth, to reckon himself to be deed
        indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hope of the glory of God, in which the Apostle here affirms that
        Christians ought to rejoice, is provided as an important part of the
        believer’s armor, — an helmet to cover his head, to defend him against
        the attacks of his spiritual enemies, 1 Thessalonians 5:8. It supports
        him when ready to be cast down. ‘Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and
        why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet
        praise Him who is the health of my countenance and my God.’ It soothes
        the bitterness of affliction when the believer is resting on the
        promises of God. In prosperity it elevates his affections, and, fixing
        his expectation on the glory that shall be revealed, disengages him from
        the love of this world. ‘My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God;
        when shall I come and appear before God?’ It comforts him in the
        prospect of death; and he says, with his Savior, ‘My heart is glad, and
        my glory rejoiceth, my flesh also shall rest in hope.’ His spirit at
        death ascends to mingle with the spirits of just men made perfect, while
        his body enters the grave as a place of rest, waiting for its glorious
        resurrection, and the day when he shall sing that song of triumph. ‘O
        death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory?’ It is the
        prayer of the Apostle, ch. 15:13, that the God of hope would fill His
        people with all joy and peace in believing, that they may abound in
        hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. Patient in tribulation. —
        Since Christians have such a good hope through grace, they ought to be
        patient under their afflictions. Nothing is better calculated to enable
        us to bear calamities than the hope of a happy result.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what can equal the prospects of the Christian when he has passed
        through the furnace and been tried as gold? His afflictions are not only
        necessary for his trial, and honorable to God, but they are for his own
        eternal advantage. The light afflictions of the righteous, which are but
        for a moment, work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight
        of glory. The trial of their faith is much more precious than that of
        gold, though it be tried with fire, and shall be found unto praise and
        honor and glory in the day of Christ. Afflictions are sent by God to His
        people to increase their patience. On account of remaining sin, they are
        their portion while in the body. ‘In the world ye shall have
        tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.’
        Continuing instant in prayer. — The Christian is to ‘pray without
        ceasing.’ No duty can be well performed without this. It is especially
        necessary in the time of affliction. ‘Paul also,’ says Calvin, ‘not only
        excites us to prayer, but expressly requires performance; because our
        warfare is unceasing, and we are daily attacked by various assaults,
        which champions even of the greatest bravery are unable to support
        without an occasional supply of new vigor. Unceasing continuance in
        prayer is the best remedy against fatigue.’ It is impossible that
        believers can discharge the various duties which are here enforced,
        without having their eyes constantly directed to their heavenly Father,
        and without receiving from Him the will and the capacity necessary for
        their discharge Our Lord’s parable of the unjust judge, Luke 18:1,
        contains the strongest encouragement to perseverance and importunity in
        prayer. The Lord commands His disciples to pray always, on account of
        the power of their spiritual enemies, who are constantly seeking their
        destruction. The Apostle also exhorts believers to pray always with all
        prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and to watch thereunto with all
        perseverance; to continue in prayer, and watch in the same with
        thanksgiving; in everything giving thanks, for this is the will of God
        in Christ Jesus; and to be careful for nothing, but in everything, by
        prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, to let their requests be
        made known unto God. If a Christian undertakes anything whatever without
        prayer, he is neglecting his duty and not acting up to his privileges.
        In that matter he is not walking with God, whose ears are open to the
        prayers of the righteous. On occasions, even, when there is not a moment
        to deliberate, and when an immediate decision is indispensable, there is
        still time for prayer and for receiving an answer, Nehemiah 2:4,8.
      </p>
      <p>
        The believer, too, should ever address his heavenly Father with full
        confidence that his prayers will be heard, not perhaps according to his
        wishes, but in a way that in the issue will be more advantageous. ‘This
        is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according
        to His will, He heareth us. And if we know that He hear us whatsoever we
        ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him
        ‘Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may
        be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do
        it.’ ‘Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.’ ‘And all
        things whatsoever ye shall ask in Prayer, believing, ye shall receive.’
        If the believer asks and does not receive, it is because he asks amiss
        he does not ask in faith, he asks for things that are not proper, he
        asks while he is indulging in sin. ‘The sacrifice of the wicked is an
        abomination to the Lord; but the prayer of the upright is His delight.’
        If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,’ Psalm
        66:18. Here, however, it is proper to remark that there is a great
        difference between iniquity prevailing in the heart, and iniquity
        regarded in the heart. In the last case we cannot draw near with
        acceptance. God will not accept our prayers, because in that case we
        cannot draw near with ‘a true heart.’ But in the former case, of
        iniquity prevailing in the hearts we may draw near in the full assurance
        of faith, of which we see an example in the case of David. ‘Iniquities,’
        he says, ‘prevail against me;’ but he immediately adds, ‘As for our
        transgressions, Thou shalt purge them away,’ Psalm 65:3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to
        hospitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Distributing to the necessity of saints. — Rather ‘communicating to the
        necessities of the saints.’ The poor brethren are thus made joint
        partakers of the substance of their richer brethren; the rich make their
        poor brethren participators with them in their substance, by giving them
        what is necessary to supply their wants. ‘Observe,’ says Calvin, ‘the
        propriety of the expression. The apostle thus intimates that we ought to
        supply the wants of our brethren with as much care as if we were
        assisting ourselves.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It may here be observed that this precept proves most clearly that there
        was no general custom among the first Christians of a community of
        goods. Had this been the case, the rich would not have been commanded to
        communicate to the necessities of the saints. It ought also to be noted
        that it is to the necessities of the saints that communication is to be
        made, not to their indolence. ‘This we commanded you, that if any would
        not work neither should he eat.’ So far from its being the duty of
        Christians to support the idle, it would be a breach of one of the laws
        of Christ’s kingdom. Saints. — It may also be observed that, while we
        are to do good unto all men, the poor saints are the peculiar care of a
        church of Christ. These are to be fed as children of the family who are
        unable to support themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here also, we may see the character of the members of the first
        churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were such only as appeared to be saints and godly in Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term saints signify those who are separated for the service of God —
        sanctified in Christ Jesus. This appellation belongs to all the people
        of God without distinction, and not to a particular class or part of
        them exclusively, such as to the Apostles. The Apostles were indeed
        saints, and so were Noah, Abraham, Moses, and all the Prophets. If this
        title were indiscriminately applied to all who are sanctified in Christ
        Jesus, — that is, to every Christian, — as in the apostolical Epistles,
        it could not be misunderstood; but its exclusive application to Apostles
        and some others besides, leads to the supposition that all Christians
        are not saints. This application is one of the engines of the Man of
        Sin, by which he deceives.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any plead for it as a proper distinction, it is sufficient to advert
        to the saying of Paul, ‘We have no such custom, neither the churches of
        God,’ 1 Corinthians 11:16. Here the reference is to the approved customs
        of the churches acting under the immediate guidance of the Apostles,
        which consequently are equivalent to direct precept. We find no such
        custom in the Scriptures, in which Prophets and Apostles name
        themselves, and each other, without this distinction. Given to
        hospitality. — This does not mean, as it is generally now applied,
        social intercourse and conviviality among neighbors, but it means the
        receiving and entertaining of strangers at a distance from their own
        habitations. This was a duty of peculiar necessity in the primitive
        times, when inns and places of entertainment were unusual. But it is a
        duty still; and the change of times and customs cannot set aside any of
        the precepts of our Lord Jesus Christ. Christians ought hospitably to
        receive their brethren coming from a distance, and to assist them in
        their business. We are here directed not only to practice hospitality,
        but, according to the import of the original, to follow or pursue it.
        Christians are to seek opportunities of this manifesting love to their
        brethren. In another place the Apostle enforces the same duty: ‘Be not
        forgetful to entertain strangers; for thereby some have entertained
        angels unawares.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 14. — Bless them which persecute you; bless, and curse not.</p>
      <p>
        Bless them which persecute you. — Calvin justly cautions us against
        endeavoring to find a certain order in these precepts. It is their
        import, and not their connection with each other, that we ought to
        ascertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes there may be a relation; at other times there is entire
        independence. The precept here given cannot be obeyed in its genuine
        sense by any who are not born again of the incorruptible seed of the
        word; and even to such it is a difficult duty. In proportion to their
        progress in the Divine life, will there be in them a difference with
        respect to their attainments in that heavenly spirit which enables them
        to comply with this injunction. But none can justly be looked on as
        Christians, who do not in some measure possess this spirit, and practice
        this precept. If this be so, how few are the genuine disciples of
        Christ! ‘None,’ says Calvin, ‘can boast himself to be a son of God, or
        glory in the name of a Christian, who has not in part put on this mind,
        which was in the Lord Jesus, and does not daily wrestle against and
        oppose the feeling of enmity and hatred. The law of God is in all
        respects a law of love, and the precept here enjoined contains a
        peculiar characteristic of Christianity, in the exhibition of which
        Christians are imitators of their heavenly Father. Our Lord Jesus Christ
        gave a signal example of obedience to this rule, when on the cross He
        prayed to his Father for the pardon of those by whom He was crucified.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Stephen, the first martyr, in imitation of his Divine Master, died
        in calling on His name, and praying for his murderers. This precept
        teaches Christians in what manner, when reviled or persecuted, they
        ought to act to their persecutors.’ ‘Being defamed,’ says the Apostle,
        ‘we entreat.’ The repetition of the precept in the following clause adds
        to the energy of the expression. Bless and curse not. — Paul repeats the
        precept to bless, on account of its importance, and its applicability to
        men in general, in connection with a command to curse no man. How does
        this condemn the Church of Rome, which so frequently manifests its
        antichristian character by cursing its enemies, and allowing its priests
        to curse from the altar those who give them offense. How many are there,
        who, calling themselves Christians openly and without shame utter
        maledictions on those who irritate them!
      </p>
      <p>
        How few abstain from imprecations of every kind and degree! f59 Ver. 15.
        — Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep.
      </p>
      <p>
        This precept has no doubt a peculiar importance with respect to the
        brethren, but it is applicable in general. We ought to sympathize with
        our fellow-creatures in their happiness and afflictions. The meaning of
        the precept is quite obvious. The prosperity of others ought to inspire
        us with joy. Their affliction ought to affect us with sorrow. Even the
        very semblance of this duty among the people of the world has a
        beneficial influence on society, heightening the joy of prosperity, and
        lessening the pain of adversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things
        but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be of the same mind one toward another. — This precept refers rather to
        unanimity, cordiality, and harmony in transacting all the business of
        the Church, than to oneness of mind as to the truth. With respect to
        faith, it is the word of God with which believers are to be in
        accordance, and not with the opinions of each other. Besides, this
        often-repeated precept is always introduced with others of a practical
        nature. Oneness of belief in everything, even the least part of the
        revelation of God, is of importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This, however, cannot be effected but by a full knowledge of the Divine
        word. The injunction is most important, and cautions against a captious
        spirit respecting the affairs of the church with which we are connected,
        or our intercourse one with another. Dr. Macknight has entirely mistaken
        the import of this passage, making it refer to what precedes. ‘Be of the
        same hospitable, forgiving, sympathizing disposition towards one another
        as towards strangers and persecutors.’ Mind not high things. — Men in
        general are aspiring to things above them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great efforts of life are to obtain high rank or commanding station
        in the world. Christians are here cautioned against setting their minds
        on high things. Nothing can be more opposed to progress in the Divine
        life, than the evil against which we are here warned. In proportion as
        Christians indulge it, they make their bed among thorns, turning away
        their eyes from the glory of their future inheritance. Condescend to men
        of low estate. — The word here translated condescend signifies to be led
        away with; and that which is rendered men of low estate may with equal
        propriety be rendered low or humble things; and in this way the clause
        is an antithesis to the one preceding. ‘Not thinking of high things,’
        says Calvin, ‘by which he means that a Christian ought not to aspire, in
        an ambitious manner, after those things by which he may surpass others,
        nor indulge in haughty feelings, but meditate rather upon modesty and
        meekness; for our excellence, in the presence of God, consists in these
        virtues, not in pride or the contempt of our brethren. This precept is
        properly added to the former; for nothing breaks the unity mentioned by
        the Apostle more completely than the exalting of ourselves, and our
        aspiring to something still more elevated, with a view to attain a
        higher situation. I take the word humble in the neuter gender, that the
        antithesis may be more complete.’ Be not wise in your own conceits. — ’
        This sentence,’ says Calvin, ‘connects with the preceding part of the
        context; for nothing inflates the mind more than a high opinion of our
        own wisdom and prudence.’ Self-conceit is an evidence of weakness of
        mind and of ignorance. So far as it manifests itself among Christians,
        it evidences low attainments in the knowledge of the things of God, and
        is most destructive to the harmony of a church, and the improvement of
        the individual under its influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in
        the sight of all men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recompense to no man evil for evil. — It is natural to every man to
        return evil for evil. Those of the most indolent and passive
        dispositions are not without feelings of revenge. Nothing but the faith
        of Christ will enable any man to overcome this disposition. But faith
        will overcome it; and every man who believes in Christ most labor to
        overcome it in his heart, as well as in his practice. If Christians are
        tried by this test, the pretensions of the great bulk of those who usurp
        the name will be found groundless. Provide things honest in the sight
        off all men. — We are not to do our work to be seen of men, but we are
        to be careful that all our works are done so as to avoid anything that
        would bring a reproach upon the Gospel. We ought not only to abstain
        from what we know to be wrong, but we ought sedulously to avoid just
        suspicion, 1 Thessalonians 5:22. Sometimes Christians say that if they
        have a good conscience, they care not what any one thinks of them. But
        this is contrary to this precept. If we are falsely charged, we may
        commit ourselves to Him who judgeth righteously. But, so far as in our
        power, we are not only to avoid what is improper, but to avoid the blame
        or suspicion of what is improper. In Paul himself we see an example of
        solicitude in this respect. ‘Providing for honest things, not only in
        the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men,’ 2 Corinthians
        8:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
        with all men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such is the state of human nature, that offenses must needs come, and
        here the Apostle, in his exhortation, proceeds on the fact of the
        difficulty of living at peace with all. The believer is,
        notwithstanding, constantly to aim at this, and to pursue it even when
        it seems to fly from him. He ought particularly to guard against giving
        occasion to any just subject of complaint against him. To live at peace
        with all men, as far as is attainable, without sacrificing duty, is not
        only duty, but for his happiness. To pursue peace, then, is to fly from
        misery. It is impossible to be happy in disturbance, and broils, and
        enmities; but it may sometimes be impossible for Christians to obtain
        peace. When this is the case, they must submit to it as one of the
        greatest afflictions; but we ought to recollect that it is God who
        giveth us peace with men, and to seek it from Him with ardent prayer, as
        well as from men, by unremitting endeavors after it. When deprived of
        it, we ought also to inquire whether there be not a cause of this in
        ourselves; for when a man’s ways please the Lord, He maketh even his
        enemies to be at peace with him. Calvin justly cautions us ‘not so to
        affect the security of the favor and esteem of men, as to refuse to
        incur, for the sake of Christ, the hatred of any human being, when
        necessary.’ As some Christians may be naturally of a contentious
        disposition, so others may, from a selfish desire of having the favor
        and good opinion and praise of men, be inclined to keep out of view
        whatever is most offensive in the religion of Christ. Such persons may
        congratulate themselves on the possession of a spirit of peace, but it
        is only a spirit of cowardice and selfishness, a spirit of worldly
        indifference to the glory of God and the salvation of men. We are never
        to seek to maintain peace, either with the world or with Christians, by
        the sacrifice of any part of Divine truth. A Christian must be willing
        to be unpopular, that he may be useful and faithful. To whatever obloquy
        or opposition it may expose him, he ought earnestly to contend for the
        faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
        unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith
        the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves. — As by the law in the members we
        are most strongly urged to take revenge on those who injure us, the
        Apostle introduces this dissuasive against indulging this corrupt
        principle, with the most endearing address. Christians will constantly
        have opportunities of exercising themselves in obedience to this
        exhortation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are innumerable occurrences calculated to provoke and excite them
        to retaliation. But they will find that to abstain from avenging their
        own cause will essentially promote their happiness. It is a painful
        thing to think of injuries, and it is most for our peace and happiness
        to forget them, and commit ourselves to the Lord. How opposite is this
        from the principles of the men of the world, and what are called the
        laws of honor, in obedience to which a man will, in cold blood, he; said
        his own life and that of his neighbor on account of some contemptuous
        expression or trivial injury! What gross ignorance does it manifest to
        consider any man a Christian, who is always prepared to act in this
        manner, and who would regard it as an affront if the contrary were
        supposed! Give place unto wrath. — Calvin, Dr. Macknight, and Mr. Stuart
        understand this of the wrath of God; but notwithstanding what the latter
        has alleged in confirmation of this, the common view of the passage is
        unquestionably the just one. No principle of language will justify the
        ellipsis that makes wrath in this connection designate the wrath of God
        or the Divine wrath. Among the various applications of the phrase ‘Give
        place,’ one of them is, to retire from the place, that it may be
        occupied by another, Luke 14:9. The person here referred to gives the
        place that he occupied to another, and retires to another place. This
        meaning, then, is quite in accordance with that of the common
        explanation of this passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give place to wrath, that is, leave the place, and let wrath occupy it;
        or give place, as a man would do if attacked by a wild beast, stepping
        aside to let it rush by. Mr. Stuart, indeed, alleges that the other
        interpretation ‘is rendered nearly certain by the quotation which
        immediately follows,’ which he supposes would be wholly inapposite if
        wrath be understood as referring to the wrath of the enemy. This
        argument, however, is without force. The meaning objected to is quite
        consistent with the quotation. ‘Take not revenge yourselves, my
        brethren, but retire from the contest, for it is not you but God who has
        a right to take vengeance.’ It is a good reason why we should not take
        vengeance, that it is God’s prerogative to take vengeance. For it is
        written, Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. — It belongs
        to God, and He will repay it. Those threatenings of the vengeance of God
        which we find in the writings of the Prophets, and especially in the
        Book of Psalm, are not to be viewed as proceeding from the angry spirit
        of the writers, but from the Holy Ghost who dictated them, who hates,
        and will come out of his place to punish, all workers of iniquity. If
        any man dare to take into his own hands the vengeance which belongeth to
        God, it will recoil upon himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this it is evident that God will avenge the injuries done to His
        people. What, then, shall be the punishment of those who employ
        themselves in persecuting, injuring, reproaching, and slandering the
        disciples of Christ. We are not, however, to understand this precept as
        prohibiting Christians from appealing to the magistrate in case of
        injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calvin, indeed, justly observes, that it prohibits us from applying to
        the magistrate from a principle of revenge. It is quite true that to
        appeal to the magistrate out of a principle of revenge is indulging
        revenge as much as if we took revenge with our own hands. But it is
        often right to appeal to the laws of our country in order to secure the
        peace of society, and defend ourselves and others from similar injuries.
        To act on the principle avowed by some, that it is wrong to apply to the
        power of the civil magistrate, is not only mistaking this precept, but
        is contrary to the fundamental principle on which society rests. In many
        cases it would be highly sinful not to punish evil-doers. If the
        magistrate ought not to bear the sword in vain, the subject ought to
        assist him in executing vengeance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
        give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his
        head.
      </p>
      <p>
        If thine enemy hunger, feed him. — A Christian must be an enemy to no
        man, but he cannot prevent others from being enemies to him; but instead
        of revenging their injuries, he is bound to do good to them. Conduct so
        opposite to nature can never be genuinely effected by the natural man.
        It is only to be effected by the power of God through faith. It is the
        fruit of the new birth only. We are not to understand this precept as
        always to be fulfilled by the giving of meat and drink; but meat and
        drink are taken as an indication that in every possible instance good
        will is to be manifested. Shalt heap coals of fire. — Dr. Macknight,
        with many others, makes this refer to the custom of fusing metals, and
        supposes that it recommends this line of conduct as the most effectual
        way to soften or melt the enemy to repentance. This, however, is a
        meaning made for the words, instead of being extracted from them. Mr.
        Stuart makes it imply pain, but thinks that it is not the pain of
        punishment, but of shame or contrition. This is equally remote from the
        obvious meaning of the expression. Besides, it is equally unwarrantable
        to do anything with a view to occasion the pain of contrition, as to
        occasion the pain of punishment. We should desire the contrition of our
        enemy for his good, and not that he may endure suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vain to force the words of the Holy Spirit. They evidently assert
        that the conduct recommended will have the effect of increasing the
        punishment of the enemies of God’s people; and though they should not
        rejoice in this effect as causing misery, yet they should hereby be led
        to adore the manifestation of Divine justice. Besides, this ought to be
        a warning to their enemies to abandon their wicked conduct, and finally
        to escape the fearful consequences which they cannot avoid if they
        persevere in their enmity. They ought to be informed of this part of the
        Divine pleasure. There can be no doubt that such conduct from the Lord’s
        people, if it does not overcome their enemies, will eventually add to
        their guilt and punishment. We should beware not to explain away the
        words of Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 21. — Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
      <p>
        Be not overcome of evil. — Christians are here exhorted not to suffer
        themselves to indulge a spirit of wrath or resentment from the
        provocations of their enemies. In the world they will experience evil on
        the part of others, but they ought never to allow themselves to be drawn
        into the commission of evil and to be overcome by it. To yield to anger
        is to be conquered by an enemy. Men in general suppose that to resent an
        injury is only to show a proper spirit. But in the estimation of God it
        is the opposite, and manifests defeat. He acts as the Christian, who
        yields not to anger, but remains without wrath under insult and ill
        treatment. When the Lord commanded the disciples to forgive their
        offending brethren, perceiving the difficulty of acting in this manner,
        they immediately prayed, ‘Lord, increase our faith.’ No prayer could be
        more suitable, and nothing more necessary for the performance of this
        duty. Overcome evil with good. — This implies that the injurious person
        may, by repeated acts of kindness, be won over from his enmity. This,
        indeed, frequently happens, and there is hardly a case in which it will
        not have some effect. But whatever may be the success, we ought always
        to make the trial. If our efforts shall be lost on our enemy, they will
        not be lost with respect to ourselves. Our Christian character will be
        more perfected, our happiness will be increased, our ways will be
        pleasing to the Lord, and our reward will be sure. Persons who cannot be
        overcome with good must be in the most awful state of hardened
        wickedness, and their punishment will be dreadful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the above remarkable portion of Scripture, we learn the true tendency
        of the doctrine of salvation wholly by grace, established in a manner so
        powerful in the preceding part of this Epistle, by which men are created
        in Christ Jesus unto good works. How beautiful is it, and how sublime
        when displayed in all its practical effects in the duties which flow
        from it, as here described! We may search all the works of the most
        admired writers, and, so far as they have not borrowed from the fountain
        of inspired truth, we shall find in them nothing comparable to the
        elevated maxims contained in this chapter. Especially we shall not
        discover the faintest shadow of resemblance to the motives by which
        these duties are here inculcated. If the heavens declare the glory of
        God, and the firmament showeth forth His handiworks, — if the invisible
        things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen by the
        things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that the
        heathen are without excuse, — how much more clearly do the Scriptures
        proclaim their Divine origin, and the majesty of their Author! God hath
        magnified His word above all His name, <19D802> Psalm 138:2.
