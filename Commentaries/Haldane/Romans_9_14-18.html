      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God?
      </p>
      <p>God forbid.</p>
      <p>
        The Apostle anticipated the objection of the carnal mind to his
        doctrine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does not loving Jacob and hating Esau before they had done any good or
        evil, imply that there is injustice in God? This objection clearly
        proves that the view taken of the preceding passage is correct. For it
        is this view which suggests the objection. Is it just in God to love one
        who has done no good, and to hate one who has done no evil? If the
        assertion respecting loving Jacob and hating Esau admitted of being
        explained away in the manner that so many do, there could be no place
        for such an objection.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what is the Apostle’s reply? Nothing but a decided rejection of the
        supposition that God’s treatment of Jacob and Esau implied injustice. By
        asking the question if there be unrighteousness with God, he strongly
        denies that in God there is here any injustice; and this denial is
        sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the doctrine which he everywhere inculcates, consistently
        with that of the whole of Scripture, God is represented as infinitely
        just, as well as wise, holy, good, and faithful. In the exercise of His
        sovereignty, therefore, all that God wills to do must be in strict
        conformity with the perfection of His character. He cannot deny Himself;
        He cannot act inconsistently with any of His Divine attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
        mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the ground on which the Apostle here rests his denial that there
        is unrighteousness with God? He makes no defense or apology for God,
        attempts no metaphysical distinctions, but rests solely on the authority
        of Scripture. He produces the testimony of God to Moses, declaring the
        same truth that he himself affirms. This is quite enough for Christians.
        It is not wise in them, as is often the case, to adopt a mode of
        vindicating God’s procedure, so very different from what He Himself
        employs. How many go about to justify God, and thereby bring God to the
        bar of man!
      </p>
      <p>
        From the defenses of Scripture doctrine, often resorted to, it might be
        supposed that God was on His trial before men, rather than that all
        shall stand before Him, and that the will of God is supreme justice. I
        will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on
        whom I will have compassion. — That is, I will have mercy on whom I
        please — I will bestow My favors, or withhold them, as seemeth to Me
        good. God by this declaration proves that He is a debtor to none; that
        every blessing bestowed upon the elect flows from gratuitous love, and
        is freely granted to whom He pleases. The answer, then, of the Apostle
        amounts to this that what is recorded concerning God’s loving Jacob and
        hating Esau is in nothing different from His usual mode of procedure
        towards men, but is entirely consistent with the whole plan of His
        government. All men are lost and guilty in Adam; it is of mercy that any
        are saved; and God declares that He will have mercy or not upon men
        according to His own good pleasure. It is only of this attribute that
        such language as is contained in this passage can be employed. The
        exercise of every other attribute is at all times indispensable, and
        never can be suspended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
        runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the conclusion from the whole. Salvation is not from the will of
        man, nor from his efforts in striving for it, but is entirely of God’s
        mercy vouchsafed to whom He pleases. What foundation, then, can be
        discovered in the word of God for those schemes of self-righteousness,
        which, in a greater or less degree, make salvation depend on man’s own
        exertions?
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be here an allusion to Jacob’s desiring the blessing of the
        birthright, and his running to provide the venison by which he deceived
        his father; but his obtaining the blessing was solely the consequence of
        God’s good pleasure, for the means he employed for the purpose merited
        punishment rather than success. In like manner, the salvation of any man
        is not to be ascribed to his own good will and diligent endeavors to
        arrive at it, but solely to the purpose of God according to election,
        which is ‘not of works, but of Him that calleth.’ It is true, indeed,
        that believers both will and run, but this is the effect, not the cause,
        of the grace of God being vouchsafed to them. ‘Work out your own
        salvation with fear and trembling.’ To whom is this addressed? To ‘the
        saints in Christ Jesus,’ in whom God had begun a good work, which He
        will perform until the day of Jesus Christ — to them who had always
        obeyed, Philippians 1:1,6,29, 2:12. But besides this, what is the motive
        or encouragement to work out their salvation? ‘For it is God which
        worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.’ Here all
        the willing and doing of men in the service of God is ascribed to His
        operation in causing them to will and to do. The whole of the new
        covenant is a promise of God that He Himself will act efficaciously for
        the salvation of those whom He will save. ‘I will put my law in their
        inward parts, and write it in their hearts.’ ‘I will give them one
        heart, and one way, that they may fear Me for ever.’ ‘I will put My fear
        in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.’ ‘A new heart also
        will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take
        away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of
        flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My
        statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them,’ Jeremiah 31,32;
        Ezekiel 36: In this way the means by which God’s elect are brought to
        Him, their calling, their justification, their sanctification, their
        perseverance, and their glorification, are all of God, as was shown in
        the preceding chapter, and not of themselves. ‘There is great folly,’
        say Calvin, ‘in the argument that we are possessed of a certain energy
        in our zeal, but of such a kind as can effect nothing of itself, unless
        aided by the mercy of Jehovah, since the Apostle shows that we possess
        nothing of our own, by excluding all our efforts. To infer that we have
        the power either of running or willing, is a mere cavil, which Paul
        denies, and plainly asserts that our will or ardor in the race has not
        the smallest influence in procuring our election. On the ether hand,
        those merit the severest reproof who continue to indulge in sloth, that
        they may afford room and opportunity for the grace of God to act; since,
        although their own industry can accomplish nothing, yet the heavenly
        zeal inspired by the Father of Lights is endued with active efficacy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        If any shall oppose the declaration of the Apostle, that it is not of
        him that willeth or of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,
        and assert that the salvation of man depends on conditions which he is
        obliged to fulfill, then it may be asked, what is the condition? Is it
        faith? Faith is the gift of God. Is it repentance? Christ is exalted a
        Prince and a Savior to give repentance. Is it love? God promises to
        circumcise the heart in order to love Him. Are they good works? His
        people are the workmanship of God created unto good works. Is it
        perseverance to the end? They are kept by the power of God through faith
        unto salvation. It is true that all these things are commanded and
        enforced by the most powerful motives, consequently they are duties
        which require the exercise of our faculties.
      </p>
      <p>
        But they are assured by the decree of election, and are granted to the
        elect of God in the proper season; so that, in this view, they are the
        objects of promise, and the effects of supernatural and Divine
        influence. ‘Thy people,’ saith Jehovah to the Messiah, ‘shall be willing
        in the day of Thy power.’ Thus the believer, in running his race, and
        working out his salvation, is actuated by God, and animated by the
        consideration of His all-powerful operation in the beginning of his
        course; of the continuation of His support during its progress; and by
        the assurance that it shall be effectual in enabling him to overcome all
        obstacles, and to arrive in safety at its termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same
        purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show My power in thee, and
        that My name might be declared throughout all the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse stands connected, not with the 15th and 16th, which
        immediately precede it, but with the 13th and 14th. In the 13th verse,
        God’s love to Jacob and His hatred to Esau are declared. In respect to
        both, it is demanded in the 14th verse, if there be injustice with God.
        In the 15th and 16th verses following, the answer is given regarding the
        preference and love of God to Jacob. In this 17th verse, the Apostle
        replies to the question as it refers to God’s hatred of Esau. And the
        answer here is precisely similar to that given respecting Jacob. God’s
        love to Jacob before he had done any good was according to His usual
        plan of procedure; and on the same ground, His hatred of Esau before he
        had done any evil is also vindicated. Paul here proves his doctrine from
        the example of one to whom, in Divine sovereignty, God acted according
        to justice without mercy. The Scripture saith that God raised up Pharaoh
        for the very purpose of manifesting His own glory in his punishment. For
        the Scripture saith. — By the manner in which the Apostle begins this
        verse, we are taught that whatever the Scriptures declare on any subject
        is to be considered as decisive on the point. ‘What saith the
        Scripture?’ This is the proof to which the Apostle appeals. It should
        further be observed, that Paul ascribes to the Scriptures what was said
        by God Himself, Exodus 9:16. This expressly teaches us that the words of
        Scripture are the words of God. In the same manner, in the Epistle to
        the Galatians, it is said, the Scripture, ‘foreseeing that God would
        justify the heathen;’ and, ‘the scripture hath concluded all under sin,’
        Galatians 3:8,22. Here the word of God is so much identified with
        Himself, that the Scripture is represented as possessing and exercising
        the peculiar prerogatives of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is done by God, and what belongs only to Him, is ascribed to the
        Scriptures, — proving that they contain the very words of God. ‘All
        Scripture is given by inspiration of God, 2 Timothy 3:16. The word
        Scripture is here taken in its appropriated meaning — being confined to
        the book of God. All that is written in it is divinely inspired; and
        what does writing consist of but of words? If any of these are not
        inspired, then all Scripture is not inspired. Every word, then, in the
        book referred to, is the word of God, dictated by Him of whom the
        writers were the instruments He employed, who spoke or wrote as they
        were moved by the Holy Ghost. Why are so many unwilling to admit this
        view of the inspiration of Scripture so much insisted on in the
        Scriptures themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it on account of the difficulty of conceiving how words should thus
        be communicated? But is it easier to understand how ideas could be
        communicated? Do they believe that the Lord ‘opened the mouth of the
        ass’ of Balaam, and communicated the words which she spake? Is it then
        more difficult to communicate words to men than to a dumb animal? To
        speak of difficulties where Omnipotence is concerned, is palpably
        absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, all allow that in the parts of Scripture to which (making vain
        distinctions respecting inspiration, without the least foundation from
        any expression the Scriptures contain) they ascribe the inspiration of
        ‘suggestion,’ the very words were communicated to the writers. Those who
        deny the plenary verbal inspiration of the Scriptures, — who introduce
        various modifications of the manner in which they have been written, —
        neither can nor ought to entertain the same profound veneration for them
        as those who believe that, without any exception, from beginning to end,
        they are dictated by God Himself. The Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, —
        that is, the Scripture showeth how Moses was commanded to say unto
        Pharaoh, Exodus 9:16, — Even for this same purpose have I raised thee
        up. — Here is the destination of Pharaoh to his destruction. That I
        might show My power in thee, and that My name might be declared
        throughout all the earth. — This is the end and design intended by it.
        It was not, then, by any concurrence of fortuitous circumstances that
        Pharaoh was seated on the throne of Egypt, and invested with the power
        he possessed when Moses was appointed to conduct Israel out of Egypt. He
        was raised up, or made to stand in that place, in order that, by his
        opposition, from the perversity of his heart, in him God might show His
        own power and exalt His own name. It is not merely alleged that God had
        not shown mercy to this king of Egypt, or that He had suffered him to go
        on in his wicked ways; but, in language which the unrenewed heart of man
        will never relish, it is declared, ‘Even for this same purpose have I
        raised thee up, that I might show My power in thee, and that My name
        might be declared throughout all the earth.’ For this very end, the
        birth, the life, and the situation of Pharaoh were all of Divine
        appointment. This is language so clear that it cannot be guiltlessly
        misinterpreted. The unbelieving heart of man will revolt, and his
        ingenuity may invent expedients to soften this explicit declaration; but
        it never can be successfully evaded. All the shifts of sophistry will
        never be able fairly, or even plausibly, to explain this language in a
        sense that will not testify the sovereignty of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above truth respecting Pharaoh is what the Scriptures declare; and
        we ought never to pretend to go further into the deep things of God than
        they go before us, but submissively to bow to every Divine declaration.
        We know that all sin will be found with man; but here we are taught that
        even the sin of man will turn out for the glory of God, and for this
        very purpose the wicked are raised up. If we cannot fathom this depth in
        the Divine counsels, still let us be certain that what God says is true,
        and must be received by us. We are assured that the Judge of all the
        earth will in all things act righteously, although we may not be able to
        comprehend His ways. Nor are we required to comprehend them. We are
        required to believe His word, and to believe that it is consistent with
        the eternal righteousness of His character. ‘Let us treasure,’ says
        Calvin, ‘the following observation in our minds, — never to feel the
        least desire to attain any other knowledge concerning this doctrine save
        what is taught us in Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Lord shuts His sacred mouth, let us also stop our thoughts from
        advancing one step further in our inquiries.’ Consistently with the vain
        attempts that have been made to reconcile the truth above affirmed with
        philosophy falsely so called, the whole subject of this chapter might be
        rejected, equally with that of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures.
        It has accordingly been perverted by many who have explained it in such
        a way as to remove all the difficulties which it presents. Our Lord in
        one short sentence has declared the true reason of their finding it so
        hard to understand this chapter. ‘Why do ye not understand My speech? —
        even because ye cannot hear My word.’ It is also written for our
        warning. ‘Many, therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard this,
        said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?’ There is no part of
        Scripture, the meaning of which is more obvious than that of this
        chapter. But if men will yield to the natural opposition of their minds
        to the truth it declares, and, wresting the plainest expressions, affirm
        that hatred signifies love, is it surprising that they are bewildered in
        following their own devices? f49 Ver. 18. — Therefore hath He mercy on
        whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the general conclusion is drawn from all the Apostle had said in
        the three preceding verses, in denying that God was unrighteous in
        loving Jacob and hating Esau. It exhibits the ground of God’s dealings
        both with the elect and the reprobate. It concludes that His own
        sovereign pleasure is the rule both with respect to those whom He
        receives, and those whom He rejects. He pardons one and hardens another,
        without reference to anything but His own sovereign will, in accordance
        with His infinite wisdom, holiness, and justice. ‘Even so, Father,’ said
        our blessed Lord, ‘for so it seemed good in Thy sight.’ God is not
        chargeable with any injustice in electing some and not others; for this
        is an act of mere mercy and compassion, and that can be no violation of
        justice. Therefore hath He mercy On whom He will have mercy. — Paul here
        repeats for the third time, that God has mercy on whom He will have
        mercy, without intimating the least regard to anything in man as
        deserving mercy. The smallest degree of right in the creature would
        furnish reason for displaying justice, not mercy. Mercy is that adorable
        perfection of God by which He pities and relieves the miserable. Under
        the good and righteous government of God, no one is miserable who does
        not deserve to be so. The objects of mercy are persons who are
        miserable, because they are guilty, and therefore justly deserving of
        punishment. The exercise of mercy is a particular display of the grace
        or free favor of God. In no case can it be due to a guilty creature; it
        necessarily implies the absence of all right. A man can never have a
        right to mercy; and to talk of deserving mercy is a contradiction in
        terms. God, it is said, ‘delighteth in mercy,’ Micah 7:18; and in the
        proclamation of His name to Moses, this attribute is particularly
        signalized. ‘The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,’ Exodus
        34:6. He is ‘rich’ and ‘plenteous’ in mercy, and ‘His tender mercies are
        over all His works.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercy, however, is an attribute, the constant exercise of which is not
        essential to God, like that of justice, which can never, as has been
        remarked, for a moment be suspended. Mercy is dispensed according to His
        sovereign pleasure in regard to persons or times, as to Him seemeth
        good. Towards the fallen children of men it was gloriously displayed
        when God sent His Son into the world, which was purely a work of mercy,
        and not demanded by justice. But to the fallen angels mercy was not
        vouchsafed. And is this any impeachment of the mercy of God? If not, is
        it a just ground for complaint, that in order to manifest His hatred of
        sin, His mercy is not extended to a certain portion of the human race,
        who we know for certain shall perish? Thus God has mercy on whom He will
        have mercy. It is one of the fundamental errors of Socinians, and of
        many besides, to hold that the mercy of God must be necessarily and
        constantly exercised; while, reversing the order of Scripture, and all
        its representations of the character of God, they deny this necessity
        regarding His justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same act, however, may be both an act of justice and an act of mercy
        in reference to different objects. The punishment of the enemies of God,
        the slaying of the firstborn in Egypt, the overthrow of Pharaoh and his
        host, the discomfiture of kings, and the transfer of their lands for an
        heritage to Israel, while they were acts of justice towards the enemies
        of His people, are all ascribed to the mercy of God to them, <19D601>
        Psalm ‘To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for His mercy
        endureth for ever: But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea:
        for His mercy endureth for ever: To Him which smote great kings: for His
        mercy endureth for ever: And slew famous kings: for His mercy endureth
        for ever: And gave their land for an heritage: for His mercy endureth
        for ever:
      </p>
      <p>
        Even an heritage to Israel His servant: for His mercy endureth for
        ever.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercy, then, which is a particular kind of Divine goodness, is
        sovereign; and to confer favors freely, consistently with Divine wisdom,
        does injury to no one. If God was only just, there would be no place for
        mercy; if He never acted as a sovereign benefactor, there could be no
        place for the plan of redemption. God may be considered under two
        different aspects, either as judging with equity, or as disposing at His
        will of His benefits; in other words, as a judge, or as a sovereign.
        Under either of these aspects, in whatever manner He acts, having
        nothing higher than Himself, He is the supreme God. Sovereignty, when
        this word is applied to God, signifies the arbitrary will of a
        benefactor, because that under the other aspects there is no place for
        the exercise of arbitrary will. In the exercise of His justice, God is
        sovereign in His judgments and His punishments, but not arbitrary,
        because He does not judge without demerit in the objects of His
        judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        When, therefore, He acts as Judge and Supreme Ruler, His acts are
        founded upon equity; but when He acts as Sovereign, His acts are founded
        upon His free favor, and dispensed with wisdom.

        Whatever offense the human mind may take at the attribute of Divine
        justice, and its exercise in punishing the guilty, we should think that
        all men would eagerly embrace the view given in Scripture of the Divine
        mercy. Yet, in reality, the peculiar character of the mercy of God is as
        disagreeable to men as is His justice itself. The Divine mercy is not
        only sovereign, but, respecting its object, it is unlimited. Neither of
        these peculiarities is agreeable to the mind of man. Human wisdom views
        God as merciful, but that mercy it makes to extend equally to all, and
        unlimitedly to none. For persons not guilty of glaring sins, God’s mercy
        is not only expected by the world, but even claimed and demanded. To
        deny it to those who are sober and regular in their lives, would be
        looked on as both cruel and unjust. In the passage before us, however,
        we see that God’s mercy is sovereign, that it extends to one and not to
        another, while no man can give a reason for the preference of one and
        the rejection of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only reason God condescends to give is His own pleasure: ‘I will
        have mercy on whom I will have mercy.’ The unlimited character of the
        Divine mercy is a thing that ought to be most agreeable to every man.
        Even should any be so blind as not to perceive that they need such mercy
        for themselves, yet, if they loved mankind, they should rejoice that the
        Divine mercy is such as to extend to the chief of sinners. Constant
        experience, however, as well as the history of our Lord’s life, shows us
        that this is not the case. Instead of rejoicing in the extent of the
        Divine mercy, the heart of the self-righteous man will swell with
        indignation when he hears that mercy is extended to the vile and the
        profligate. Nothing in the conduct of our Lord gave such offense to the
        scribes and Pharisees as this peculiarity in His conduct of receiving
        sinners In the most prominent manner He exhibited this feature of mercy,
        and publicans and sinners heard Him, and received His doctrine, and
        turned from their sins unto God; while the proud, self-righteous
        Pharisees burned with indignation at the conduct of Christ in this
        instance. He was constantly upbraided as receiving sinners and eating
        with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the mercy of God, Dr. Thomson observes, ‘It cannot be that His mercy
        should be exerted at the expense or to the disparagement, in any the
        least degree, of one excellence which beautifies His nature, or upholds
        His government, or speaks His praise. His mercy is sovereign and
        gratuitous; and therefore it can only be displayed when every other
        quality that belongs to Him is fully maintained, and there is no
        sacrifice of the honor that is due to each, and of the consistency which
        pervades the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever His mercy cannot be exercised without refusing the demands of
        His justice, or without bringing into question the immutability of His
        faithfulness, or without denying the irresistible energy of His power,
        or without impeaching the infallibility of His wisdom, or without
        throwing suspicion on the absolute purity of His nature — in these cases
        His mercy cannot be exercised at all, for the exercise of it would
        involve some shortcoming in His perfection, which is necessarily
        unqualified and unlimited. It is only of this attribute that it can be
        said, ‘He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy.’ Of every other
        attribute it is requisite that we predicate positive and peremptory
        operation. He must be holy; He must be wise; He must be powerful; He
        must be just; He must be true; He must be each and all of these,
        whatever betide His universe; and if we, His apostate creatures, cannot
        be the objects of His mercy except by some surrender of the homage due
        to them, or some violation of the harmony that reigns among them, His
        mercy cannot save, and cannot reach us.’ And whom He will He hardeneth.
        — If God hath mercy on whom He will, He hardeneth whom He will. In
        hardening men, God does no injustice, nor does He act in any degree
        contrary to the perfection of His character. He does not communicate
        hardness or perversity to the hearts of men by any positive internal
        act, as when He communicates His grace. ‘Let no man say when he is
        tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil,
        neither tempteth He any man.’ Wicked men are not restrained by the holy
        influences of grace, but by the different restraints under which they
        are placed by Providence. They are hardened when these restraints are
        removed, and when they are left free to act according to the depraved
        inclinations of their own hearts, to which the Lord gives them up, Psalm
        81:12; Acts 7:42; Romans 1:24,26,28. Or they are hardened by the
        communication of qualities which are neither good nor bad in themselves,
        but which may become either good or bad according to the use made of
        them, such as courage, perseverance, or other dispositions which may be
        employed for bad purposes. Men are also hardened when they are abandoned
        to the suggestions of Satan, of whom they are the willing slaves. Thus
        Judas was hardened by Satan, who had taken possession of him, and to
        whom he submitted himself, although most solemnly warned of his danger.
        When a man is entirely left to himself, the commands, the warnings, the
        judgments, the deliverances, and all the truths of Scripture become
        causes of hardness, of insensibility, of pride, and presumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the delay of merited punishment, and the deliverances from the
        plagues that fell on his country, were, in respect to Pharaoh, the
        occasion of hardening his heart. ‘Because sentence against an evil work
        is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is
        fully set in them to do evil’ In these ways men’s hearts are hardened,
        through means that in themselves are calculated to produce the opposite
        effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        But by whatever means the heart of men is hardened, they are regulated
        by God, who also determines that they shall succeed. We see this
        remarkably verified in the case of Ahab. ‘And the Lord said, Thou shalt
        entice him, and thou shalt also prevail. Go out and do even so. Now,
        therefore, behold the Lord hath put a Lying spirit in the mouth of these
        thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee,’ 2 Chronicles
        18:21. ‘If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
        Lord have deceived that prophet; and I will stretch out My hand upon
        him, and will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel,’ Ezekiel
        14:9. ‘Truly the Son of Man goeth, as it was determined; but woe unto
        that man by whom Me is betrayed,’ Luke 22:22. ‘Him, being delivered by
        the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by
        wicked hands have crucified and slain,’ Acts 2:23. ‘Of a truth against
        Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius
        Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered
        together, for to do whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined
        before to be done,’ Acts 4:27. ‘A stone of stumbling, and a rock of
        offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient;
        whereunto also they were appointed,’ 1 Peter 2:8. This shows an
        ordination of God to the thing referred to, which thing was sinful.
        ‘There are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
        ordained to this condemnation.’ The persons here spoken of are said to
        be ordained to condemnation, which, whatever it may be supposed to be,
        implies pre-appointment to it by God, Jude 4. ‘Therefore, they could not
        believe, because Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and
        hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor
        understand with their heart, and I should heal them,’ John 12:39.
        ‘According as it is written, God hath given them a spirit of slumber,
        eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto
        this day,’ Romans 11:8. ‘And for this cause God shall send them strong
        delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned
        who believe not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,’ 2
        Thessalonians 2:11. It is nothing to the purpose to allege that this was
        in judgment for not receiving the love of the truth; whatever was the
        cause, God sent them strong delusion, so that they should believe a lie.
        In the same way it is said, Revelation 17:17, ‘God hath put in their
        hearts to fulfill His will, and to agree and give their kingdom to the
        beast.’ ‘Babylon,’ says Dr. Carson, in his History of Providence, ‘ was
        employed by Providence for the chastisement of His people, and
        commissioned to carry the Jews into captivity. Babylon was guilty in
        executing the will of the Lord, and was providentially destroyed by Him
        with an unexampled destruction. The Medes and Persians are sent by God
        to execute His vengeance on Babylon. He calls out their hosts and gives
        them victory, yet the Medes and Persians were excited by their own
        passions. Besides, says God, I will bring up the Medes against them,
        which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight
        in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have
        no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.
        How awful does Providence appear here! Even when savage idolaters
        violate every dictate of humanity, they are the executors of the
        judgments of the Almighty. While their conduct is most horridly guilty,
        in the Divine sovereignty it fulfills God’s will. Who can fathom this
        depth? In God’s dealings with Assyria and Babylon we ought to find a key
        to His providence in His dealings with the western nations of Europe.
        Does not Jehovah govern the world? Is there evil in the city, and the
        Lord hath not done it?’
      </p>
      <p>
        In all the above acts relating to men, God proceeds in conformity to His
        justice. He is infinitely just in hating, hardening, and condemning
        sinners, in adjudging them to punishment for their wickedness, and in
        placing them in situations in which, in the free exercise of their evil
        dispositions, they will do what the Lord has appointed for His own
        glory. Thus God orders events in such a manner, that, as in the passages
        above quoted, the sin will, through the wickedness of men: certainly be
        committed, while He is not the author of evil, but, on the contrary, of
        good. He displays His holiness in the events and in their consequences.
        Men may employ all their art in wresting the above and similar passages,
        but they are recorded in the Scriptures, which are the word of God, and
        which cannot be broken. ‘The Lord hath made all things for Himself; yea,
        even the wicked for the day of evil,’ Proverbs 16:4. ‘Why dost thou
        strive against Him? for He giveth not account of His matters,’ — or
        answereth not, Job 33:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        That God does not harden any man in such a way as to be the author of
        sin, is most certain. But there must be a sense in which He hardens
        sinners, or the thing would not be asserted. From His conduct with
        respect to Pharaoh, it is obvious that sinners are hardened by the
        providence of God bringing them into situations that manifest and excite
        their corruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the history of Pharaoh in the Book of Exodus, it is repeated ten
        times, that God hardened Pharaoh’s heart. Pharaoh is also said to have
        hardened his own heart. This shows that there is a certain connection
        between God’s hardening the hearts of men and their voluntarily
        hardening their own hearts, so that when the one takes place the other
        does so likewise. It does not follow from this that God’s hardening the
        heart of Pharaoh, and Pharaoh’s hardening his own heart, are one and the
        same thing. This supposition, although adopted by many is contrary to
        the representations and the express words of Scripture. The just
        inference is, that there is one view in which Pharaoh hardened his
        heart, and another in which God is said to have hardened it. We should
        believe both; but to attempt to show the philosophy of their
        reconciliation, is to attempt to fathom infinity. In <19A525> Psalm
        105:25, it is said with respect to the people of Egypt, that God ‘turned
        their heart to hate His people.’ Can anything be stronger or more clear
        than this passage? No doubt it was their own sin, but there is also a
        sense in which the thing was of God. Are we to deny this because we
        cannot explain the way in which God did this? On the same ground we
        might reject the doctrine of the Trinity, or any other of the
        incomprehensible doctrines of Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this subject, Dr. Carson, in his book lately published, entitled,
        Examination of the Principles of Biblical Interpretation of Ernesti,
        Ammon, Stuart, and other Philologists, observes, ‘It is said that God
        hardened the heart of Pharaoh; it is said also that Pharaoh hardened his
        own heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        What, then, is the lawful way to reconcile these two statements? The
        statements must both be true. There must be a sense in which God
        hardened Pharaoh’s heart, for this is as expressly asserted as that
        Pharaoh hardened his own heart. That this is not a sense implying that
        God is the author of Pharaoh’s sin, there cannot be a moment’s question.
        I may be asked how God could in any sense harden a man’s heart without
        being the author of sin a But the most assured belief of the fact does
        not require that an answer should be given to the question. A thing may
        be true, yet utterly inexplicable. God’s declaration is perfectly
        sufficient for the belief of anything which He testifies. Our reception
        of it does not imply that we know the grounds or nature of its truth. We
        receive it, not because we can explain how it is true, but because we
        know that God cannot lie. The Scriptures testify the fact; the fact,
        then, must be received as truth. The Scriptures do not testify the
        manner in which the thing is true of God; the manner, then, is not a
        thing to be believed, and consequently not a thing to be explained by
        man.... Many tell us that such assertions mean merely that God permits
        the thing which He is said to do. But is permission sufficient to secure
        accomplishment? God sent Joseph to Egypt; that is, it is said, He
        permitted his brethren to sell him. Nay, but it was God’s will, purpose,
        and plan, that Joseph should go down to Egypt, and His providence
        secured the event. “Now, therefore,” says Joseph, “be not grieved nor
        angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither! for God did send me
        before you to preserve life.” His brethren did it wickedly; God did it
        in mercy and in wisdom. We know that he did it entirely in consistency
        with man’s accountability; but the manner of this consistency is not a
        matter of revelation, and therefore it is impossible to attempt
        explanation. “ Romans 9:18,” says Ammon, “appears to be an obscure
        passage relating to the absolute decrees of God. Light may be thrown
        upon this by 1 Samuel 6:6, where Pharaoh is said to have hardened his
        own heart.”
      </p>
      <p>
        How does 1 Samuel 6:6 throw light upon Romans 9:18? We might have
        expected rather that Ammon would have found a contradiction, as the one
        passage ascribes to God what the other ascribes to man. The passages
        indeed are consistent; but their consistency must be made out, not by
        obliging one of them to silence the other, but by the principle that
        they assert the same thing in a different view. Ammon’s plan, I presume,
        is to make Romans 9:18 recant, in order to harmonize with 1 Samuel 6:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the honor of Scripture, and of God’s character, require that they
        should be reconciled in a way that renders both true.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Calvin, in his commentary on Exodus, represents those as perverting the
        Scriptures who insist that no more is meant than a bare permission when
        God is said to harden the hearts of men. He speaks of such as frigid
        speculatores, diluti moderatores, to whose delicate ears such Scripture
        expressions seem harsh and offensive. They therefore, he observes,
        ‘soften them down by turning an action into a permission, as if there
        were no difference between acting and suffering, i.e., suffering others
        to act.’ Such, he says, who will admit of permission only, suspend this
        counsel and determination of God, wholly on the will of man; but that he
        is not ashamed or afraid to speak as the Holy Spirit does, and does not
        hesitate to approve and embrace what the Scriptures so often declares,
        viz., that God blinds the minds of wicked men, and hardens their hearts.
        In his commentary on the passage before us, Romans 9:18, to the same
        purpose he observes, ‘The word hardening, when attributed to God in
        Scripture, not only means permission (as some trifling theologians
        determine), but the action of Divine wrath; for all external
        circumstances, which contribute to blind the reprobates, are instruments
        of the Divine indignation. Satan also himself, the internal efficacious
        agent, is so completely the servant of the Most High, as to act only by
        His command.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frivolous attempt of the school men to avoid the difficulty by
        foreknowledge, is completely subverted; for Paul does not say that the
        ruin of the wicked is foreseen by the Lord, but ordained by His counsel,
        decree, and will. Solomon also teaches that the destruction of the
        wicked was not only foreknown, but they were made on purpose for the day
        of evil’ ( Proverbs 16:4). f51 Some profess Calvinism, but affect to
        hold it in a more unexceptionable manner than it is held in the system
        in general. They seem to think that in the defense of that system,
        Calvin was extravagant, and that he gave unnecessary offense by
        exaggerated statements, and by language not warranted by the Scriptures.
        Such persons, it is presumed, are strangers to the writings of Calvin.
        Calvin himself is remarkable for keeping on Scripture ground, and
        avoiding anything that may justly be termed extravagant. No writer has
        ever indulged less in metaphysical speculation on the deep things of God
        than this writer. To support his system, it was necessary only to
        exhibit Scripture testimony, and he seems quite contented to rest the
        matter on this foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is called moderate Calvinism is in reality refined Arminianism. It
        is impossible to modify the former without sliding into the latter. If
        the doctrine of God’s sovereignty and of unconditional election be
        denied, regeneration and redemption must undergo a corresponding
        modification, and all the doctrines of grace will be more or less
        affected. While it is admitted that many of the people of God, through
        imperfect views of Divine truth, falter on the subject of election, it
        is a truth essential to the plan of salvation, and a truth most
        explicitly revealed. No truth in the Scriptures is more easily defended.
        The reason why many find it difficult to defend this doctrine is, that
        they suppose it necessary to account for it by human wisdom, and to
        justify the conduct of God. We have nothing to do with the grounds of
        the Divine procedure, we have to do only with the Divine testimony, that
        testimony which Mr. Tholuck so fearfully perverts. There are many who in
        words fully admit the doctrine of predestination, and at the same time
        neutralize it by dwelling exclusively upon God’s being love, and laying
        the blame of the whole world not being saved on the sloth of
        Christians.] That ordination, with respect to evil, is merely
        permission, is an opinion which cannot be maintained. Permission is not
        ordination in any sense of the term, and ordination is quite a different
        idea from permission. We may permit what we do not ordain, and when we
        ordain anything, we do more than permit it. But it will be replied, Does
        not this make God the author of sin? It is answered, that the sense in
        which God ordains sin is above our comprehension. It must be a sense in
        which He is not the author of sin — a sense, too, in which
        responsibility entirely rests with man. But the way in which this is
        true, we cannot explain. It is enough to know that God hath declared it.
        We are to believe Him on His own testimony, and to honor Him by
        submitting to whatever He declares. God tells us that He doth such
        things, He tells us also that men do these things. We should believe
        both assertions, though we cannot reconcile them. Does not God say in
        His word — ’As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways
        higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts?’ Does He not
        say that His ways are past finding out? If we could fathom all the ways
        of God, the Scriptures could not be His word. What God reveals, let us
        know: what He conceals, let us not attempt to discover. God is from
        eternity; but we are of yesterday and know nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, as He declared from the beginning of the
        history He would do; but did not put evil into his mind. There was no
        need for this, for he was previously wicked like all mankind. God has no
        occasion to put evil into the heart of any, in order to their
        destruction, for in consequence of the curse of the broken law (from
        which God’s people alone are delivered), there is in no natural man
        anything good towards God, Romans 8:7. While He thus punished Pharaoh’s
        wickedness no more than his iniquity deserved, God, in doing so,
        displayed to His people Israel their security under His protection.
