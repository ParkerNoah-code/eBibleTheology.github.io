      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 19. — Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth He yet find fault? For
        who hath resisted His will?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the Apostle obviates a third objection or cavil. The first was,
        that God is unfaithful, verse 6. The second, that God is unjust, verse
        14. This third is, that God is severe and cruel. If God thus shows
        mercy, or hardens according to His sovereign pleasure, why, then, it may
        be asked, does He yet find fault with transgressors? This is the only
        objection that can be made to what the Apostle was stating. Thou wilt
        say, then, who hath resisted His will? If God wills sin, and if He is
        all-powerful, must He not be the author of sin? Mr. Fry here remarks, —
        ’The thought will frequently start in the mind of the inquirer: If
        Divine grace is bestowed on some, and withheld from others; especially
        if the sins and transgressions of men are so under the control of the
        Almighty, that they but serve His purposes, how is it that such blame
        and censure attaches to the sinner, and that such dreadful judgments are
        denounced against him? If our unrighteousness commend the righteousness
        of God, what shall we say then, is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?
        This, it will be perceived, is no other than the difficulty so generally
        felt in attempting to reconcile the responsibility of man as a moral
        agent, with a pre-ordination of all events, after the determinate
        counsel and foreknowledge of God. This pre-ordination the Apostle had
        asserted and proved from the Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Scriptures, at the same time, is evinced the complete
        responsibility of man as a moral agent: God’s finding fault; His
        remonstrances with transgressors; the declaration of their amenableness
        to a just judgment the manner in which the Gospel addresses them, and
        bewails their hardness and their impenetrable heart, unquestionably
        establishes this point. The proud wisdom of rebellious man indeed,
        almost dares to charge the oracles of God with inconsistency on this
        head; or, what is nearly as bad, takes upon itself either to explain
        away or to invalidate one part of the Scripture truth in order to
        establish the other, and, in apologizing for Him before His creatures,
        to make God consistent with Himself! Such is the wicked presumption of
        man; such, we may lament to add, is the officious folly of some who mean
        to be the advocates of revelation; and the weak and imprudent defense of
        a friend is as dishonorable often as the open accusation of an enemy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The objection stated in the verse before us is in substance the same as
        is urged to this day, and it never can be put more strongly than here by
        the Apostle. What, then, does he answer? This we learn in the subsequent
        verses, in which he charges upon those who prefer it, their great
        impiety in presuming to arraign the ways of God, and to take up an
        argument against their Maker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall
        the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
      </p>
      <p>
        To the preceding objection, the Apostle, in this and the two following
        verses, gives three distinct answers. His first answer in this verse,
        similar to Isaiah 45:9, is directed against the proud reasonings of man
        who, though he be born like a wild ass’s colt, and being of yesterday,
        knows nothing, Job 11:12, presumes to scan the deep things of God, and
        to find fault with the plan of His government and providence, into which
        angels desire to look, while they find it incomprehensible. We are here
        taught that it is perfectly sufficient to silence all objections, to
        prove that anything is the will of God. No man, after this is done, has
        a right to hesitate or to doubt. The rectitude of God’s will is not to
        be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        What men have to do is to learn what God says, and then to receive it as
        unquestionably true and right. Nay but, O man, who art thou? — And what
        is man that he should take upon him to object to anything that God says?
        The reason and discernment between right and wrong which he possesses is
        the gift of God; it must, then, be the greatest abuse of these faculties
        to employ them to question the conduct of Him who gave them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question of the Apostle imports that it is a thing most preposterous
        for such a creature as man to question the procedure of God. Shall the
        thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why hast Thou formed me this? —
        Can anything be more presumptuous than for the creature to pretend to
        greater wisdom than the Creator? Any wisdom the creature possesses must
        have been received from the Creator; and if the Creator has the power of
        forming rational beings, must He not Himself be infinite in wisdom? And
        does it not insult the Creator to pretend to find imperfection in His
        proceedings? Why, as Thou art all-powerful, hast Thou formed me in such
        a manner that I am capable of sin and misery?
      </p>
      <p>
        The rebellious heart of man is never satisfied with the Apostle’s
        answer, and still the question is, Why did He make men to be condemned?
        Let the Lord’s people be satisfied with the Apostle’s answer, and let it
        be sufficient for them to know that God has willed both the salvation of
        the elect, and the destruction of the wicked, although they are not able
        to fathom the depths of the ways of God. The Apostle tells us the fact,
        and shows us that it must be received on God’s testimony, and not on our
        ability to justify it. That God does all things right there is no
        question, but the grounds of His conduct He does not now explain to His
        people. Much less is it to be supposed that He would justify His conduct
        by explaining the grounds of it to His enemies. No man has a right to
        bring God to trial.
      </p>
      <p>
        What He tells us of Himself, or of ourselves, let us receive as
        unquestionably right. ‘Paul,’ says Calvin, ‘doth not busily labor to
        excuse God with a lying defense. He would not have neglected refuting
        the objection, that God reprobates or elects, according to His own will,
        those whom He does not honor with His favor, or love gratuitously, had
        he considered it to be false. The impious object, that men are exempted
        from guilt if the will of God has the chief part in the salvation of the
        elect, or destruction of the reprobate. Does Paul deny it? Nay; his
        answer confirms this truth — that God determines to do with mankind what
        He pleases, and that men rise up with unavailing fury to contest it,
        since the Maker of the world assigns to His creatures, by His own right,
        whatever lot He chooses. If we cannot declare a reason why He
        vouchsafeth to grant mercy to them that are His, but because it pleaseth
        Him, neither also shall we have any other cause in rejecting of others
        than His own will; for when it is said that God hardeneth or showeth
        mercy to whom He will, men are thereby savored to seek no cause
        elsewhere than in His own will’ ‘Mere human reason,’ says Luther to
        Erasmus, ‘can never comprehend how God is good and merciful; and
        therefore you make to yourself a God of your own fancy, who hardens
        nobody, condemns nobody, pities everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot comprehend how a just God can condemn those who are born in
        sin, and cannot help themselves, but must, by a necessity of their
        natural constitution, continue in sin, and remain children of wrath. The
        answer is, God is incomprehensible throughout, and therefore His
        justice, as well as His other attributes, must be incomprehensible. It
        is on this very ground that St. Paul exclaims, “O the depth of the
        riches of the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and
        His ways past finding out!” Now, His judgments would not be past finding
        out, if we could always perceive them to be just.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
        make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the Apostle’s second answer to the objection contained in the
        19th verse, in which, by another reference to Scripture, he asserts that
        the thing formed ought not to contend with Him that formed it, who has a
        right to dispose of it as He pleases. The words in the original,
        translated ‘power’ in this verse and the following, are different. The
        word here employed is variously applied as signifying authority,
        license, liberty, right; but in its application to God there can be no
        question that it denotes power justly exercised. The mere power or
        ability of doing what God pleases, cannot be the meaning, for this is
        not the thing questioned. It is the justice of the procedure that is
        disputed, and it is consequently the justice of this exercise of power
        that must be asserted. With respect to all other beings, the license,
        liberty, or right referred to, may be, as it is, derived from a
        superior; but in this sense it cannot refer to God. When, therefore, it
        is said here that God has ‘power,’ it must mean that He may, in the
        instance referred to, use His power in conformity to justice. The right
        has not a reference to a superior as conferring it, but a reference to
        His own character, to which all the actions of this sovereignty must be
        conformable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power, then, in this place, signifies right or power which is consistent
        with justice. It is this right or power according to justice that is
        here asserted.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the potter molds the clay into what form he pleases, he does
        nothing contrary to justice; neither does God do injustice in the
        exercise of absolute power over His creatures. Out of the same original
        lump or mass He forms, in His holy sovereignty, one man unto honor, and
        another unto dishonor, without in any respect violating justice. Here it
        is implied that as there is no difference between the matter or lump out
        of which the potter forms diversity of vessels, so there is no
        difference in mankind, Romans 3:22; all men — both those who are
        elected, and those who are rejected, that are made vessels of mercy, or
        vessels of wrath — are alike by nature in the same condemnation in which
        God might in justice have left the whole, but out of which in His holy
        sovereignty He saves some, while He exercises His justice in pouring out
        His wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        That we are all in the hand of God as the clay in the potter’s hand, is
        humbling to the pride of man, yet nothing can be more self-evidently
        true.
      </p>
      <p>
        If so, God has the same right over us that a potter has over the clay of
        which he forms his vessels for his own purposes and interest. The same
        figure as is employed by the Prophet Isaiah, in declaring the right that
        God had over him and all the people of Israel, God likewise employs,
        Jeremiah 18:6: ‘O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter?
        saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye
        in Mine hand, O house of Israel.’ A potter forms his vessels for
        himself, and not for his vessels. This determines the question with
        respect to God’s end in the creation of man. Philosophers can discern no
        higher end in creating man than that of making him happy. But the chief
        end of the potter in molding his vessels has a reference to himself, and
        God’s chief end in making man is His own glory. This is plainly held
        forth in a multitude of passages in Scripture. Let man strive with his
        Maker as he will, still he is nothing but the clay in the hand of the
        potter. There cannot, indeed, be a question but that God will act justly
        with all His creatures; but the security for this is in His own
        character, and we can have no greater security against God’s power than
        His own attributes. God will do His creatures no injustice; but this is
        because justice is a part of His own character. Our security for being
        treated justly by God is in Himself. One vessel unto honor and another
        unto dishonor. — Some endeavor to explain this as implying that certain
        vessels may be made for a less honorable use, while they are still
        vessels for the Master’s service. But it is not said that they are made
        for a less honorable use, but that they are made to dishonor, is the
        Apostle’s assertion. It is true, indeed, that even vessels employed for
        dishonorable purposes are useful, and it is equally true that the
        destruction of the wicked will be for the glory of God. If any are
        condemned at all, and on any ground whatever, it is certain that it must
        be for the glory of God, else He would not appoint it to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the verse before us, and the preceding, it is to be observed that the
        Apostle does not say that his meaning in what he had previously affirmed
        had been mistaken, and that he had not said that it was agreeable to the
        will of God that the hardness of men’s hearts should take place as it
        does; he implicitly grants this as truth, and that he had asserted it.
        And so far from palliating or softening down the expression to which the
        objection is made, if possible, he heightens and strengthens it. All
        mankind are here represented as originally lying in the same lump or
        mass; a great difference afterwards appears among them. Whence does this
        difference arise? The Apostle explicitly answers, It is God who makes
        the difference. As the potter makes one vessel as readily as he makes
        another, and each vessel takes its form from his hand, so God makes one
        man to honor and another to dishonor. And God’s sovereign right to do
        this is here asserted; and he who objects to this, the Apostle says,
        speaks against God. Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it,
        Why hast Thou made me thus? This representation is entirely consistent
        with all that the Scriptures elsewhere teach. In the fundamental
        doctrine of regeneration and the new creation in Christ Jesus, it is
        expressly inculcated, and is entirely coincident with the question, ‘Who
        maketh thee to differ from another?’ 1 Corinthians 4:7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — What if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make his power
        known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
        destruction; In this and the following verse, in which the substance of
        the doctrine of predestination is contained in a few words, the Apostle
        gives his third and final answer to the objection stated in the 19th
        verse, subjoining the reasons of God’s different proceedings with one
        man and with another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hereby God manifests His great displeasure against sin, and His power to
        take vengeance on sinners; He exercises great patience towards them,
        seeing they are vessels of wrath fitted to destruction by their own
        wickedness, to which God shuts them up in His judgment. On the other
        hand, what can be said against it, if He proceed in mercy with others,
        thereby manifesting the riches of His glory, or His glorious grace,
        since they are vessels of mercy, whom, by His sovereign election from
        eternity, and the sanctification of His Spirit in time, He had afore
        prepared unto glory? The sum of the Apostle’s answer here is, that the
        grand object of God, both in the election and the reprobation of men, is
        that which is paramount to all things else in the creation of the
        universe, namely, His own glory. With the assertion of this doctrine,
        however offensive to the natural man, which must always appear to him
        foolishness, Paul winds up, in the last verse of the eleventh chapter,
        the whole of his previous discussion in this Epistle. What if God,
        willing to show His wrath. — Here the purpose of God, in enduring the
        wicked in this world, is expressly stated to arise from His willingness
        to show His wrath against sin. We see, then, that the entrance of sin
        into the world was necessary to manifest the Divine character in His
        justice and hatred of sin. Had sin never entered into the creation of
        God, His character would never have been fully developed. Let wicked men
        hear what God says in this place. They flatter themselves that in some
        way, through mercy, or because great severity, they suppose, would not
        be just, they will finally escape. But God here declares by the Apostle,
        that He has endured sin in the world for the very purpose of glorifying
        Himself in its punishment. How, then, shall they escape? And to make His
        power known. — The entrance of sin was also an occasion of manifesting
        God’s power and wisdom in overruling it for His glory. The power or
        ability of God, according to the original word used here, is different
        from the power (another word in the original) in the preceding verse, as
        is strikingly seen in this place. The 21st verse asserts the right of
        God to act in the manner supposed; this verse shows that His doing so
        was to manifest His wrath against sin, and His power to make even sin to
        glorify His name. Sin is in its own nature to God’s dishonor. He has
        overruled it so that He has turned it to His glory. This is the most
        wonderful display of power. Endured with much long-suffering. — How
        often do men wonder that God endures so much sin as appears in the
        world. Why does not God immediately cut off transgressors? Why does He
        not make an end of them at once? The answer is, He endures them for His
        own glory, and in their condemnation He will be glorified. To
        short-sighted mortals, it would appear preferable if God would cut off
        in childhood all whom He foresaw should continue in wickedness. But God
        endures them to old age, and to the utmost bounds of wickedness, for the
        glory of His own name. Vessels of wrath, — vessels ‘full of the fury of
        the Lord,’ Isaiah 51:20. Here Paul calls the wicked vessels, in allusion
        to the figure which he had just before used. Fitted to destruction. —
        They are vessels, indeed, but they are vessels of wrath, and by their
        sins they are fitted for destruction; and it is in the counsel of
        Jehovah that this shall be so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — And that He might make known the riches of His glory on the
        vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse, Paul had declared that God exercised much
        long-suffering towards the vessels of wrath — that part of Israel which
        were not of Israel; and here he shows that it was the will of God to
        make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy whom He had
        afore prepared unto glory. In men’s rejection of the salvation of
        Christ, the exceeding sinfulness of sin is manifested; and we learn that
        no external means, in truth, nothing short of almighty power, could save
        a guilty and lost creature. Those, therefore, who are called and saved
        are saved by a new creation; not effected by a word, as the old creation
        was, but by the power and calling of the Holy Spirit through the
        incarnation and death of the Son of God for the sins of His people, and
        His resurrection for their justification, made known in the everlasting
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse it is implied that the awful ruin of the wicked is
        necessary for the full display of the riches of Divine mercy in saving
        the elect. Both the righteous and the wicked are by nature equally
        exposed to wrath; and the deliverance of the elect from that situation
        to be made heirs of glory; wonderfully illustrates the infinitude of
        mercy. The salvation of the elect is mercy, pure mercy; and it is
        wonderful mercy, when we consider what was the doom they deserved, and
        would have experienced, had they not been delivered by God through Jesus
        Christ. These vessels of mercy were previously prepared for their happy
        lot by God Himself. Which He had afore prepared unto glory. — In the
        preceding verse it is said that the vessels of wrath are fitted for
        destruction, and in this verse, that the vessels of mercy are prepared
        unto glory. The wicked are fitted for destruction by their sins, and the
        elect prepared before by God unto glory. No particular stress is to be
        laid on the word fitted , as if it could not apply to the righteous, for
        they also are fitted for glory. It is usual to say that the wicked were
        fitted by Satan and their own folly for destruction. No doubt Satan is
        concerned in it, but as no agent is asserted, it is not necessary to
        determine this. They also may be said to fit themselves; yet it appears
        that it is not the agent, but the means that the Apostle has in view. It
        is their sins which fit them for destruction. On the other hand, the
        elect are afore prepared unto glory. This cannot be by themselves, but
        must be by God as the agent. This is expressly stated: ‘Whom He hath
        prepared.’ The elect are not only afore prepared unto glory, but it is
        God who prepares them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is suggested, by what is said in this and the preceding verse, that
        God does not harden sinners or punish them for the sake of hardening or
        making them miserable, or because He has any delight or pleasure in
        their sin or punishment considered in themselves, and unconnected with
        the end to be answered by them, but He does this to answer a wise and
        important end. This great end is the manifestation and display of His
        own perfections; to show His wrath, and to make His power known, and to
        make known the riches of His glory. That is, He does it for Himself —
        for His own glory. It is also suggested that what God does in hardening
        sinners, and making them vessels unto dishonor, and enduring with much
        long-suffering those vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, is
        consistent with their being blamable for their hardness, and for
        everything which renders them dishonorable. Consequently it is also
        consistent with His high displeasure at their conduct, and proves that
        He may justly destroy them for ever for their hardness and obstinacy in
        sin. This is supposed and asserted in the words, otherwise sinners could
        not be vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. To allege that these
        scriptures import no more than that God permits sin, and orders
        everything respecting the event, so that if God permits, it will
        certainly take place, does not obviate any difficulty which has been
        supposed here to present itself. For this is still representing God as
        willing that sin should take place, or, on the whole, choosing that it
        should exist rather than not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many who admit the doctrine of predestination object to the use of the
        term reprobation, so often employed by the first Reformers, and the old
        and most esteemed Christian writers. In its place they would substitute
        the word rejection. But that word does not always convey the full import
        of what is intended by the term reprobation; and whether this term be
        used or not, all that is comprehended under it is strictly according to
        Scripture. Reprobation includes two acts: the one is negative, which
        consists in what is called perpetration, or the passing by of those who
        are not elected, — that is, leaving them in their natural state of
        alienation or enmity against God; the other is positive, and is called
        condemnation, — the act of condemning on account of sin those who have
        been passed by.
      </p>
      <p>
        That first act consists in God’s simply withholding His grace, to which
        no man can have any claim. For this, accordingly, the Scriptures give no
        reason but the sovereign pleasure of God, who has mercy on whom He will
        have mercy, and who might justly have left all men to perish in their
        sins. In the second act, God considers man as guilty, and a child of
        wrath; and as on this account He punishes him in time, so from all
        eternity He has ordained to punish him. In electing sinners, then, or in
        passing them by, God acts as a sovereign dispensing or withholding His
        favors, which are His own, as to Him seemeth good. In condemning, He
        exercises His justice in the punishment of the guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        He may impart His grace to whomsoever He pleases, without any one having
        a right to find fault, since in regard to those whom He destines to
        salvation He has provided means to satisfy His justice. On the other
        hand, those who are guilty have no right to complain if He hath
        appointed them to wrath, 1 Thessalonians 5:9; 1 Peter 2:8; Jude 4; for
        God was under no obligation to exercise mercy towards sinners. Both
        these doctrines of election and reprobation are exemplified in the case
        of Jacob and Esau, in which there is nothing peculiar. Jacob was loved
        and chosen before he was born, and Esau before he was born was an object
        of hatred and reprobation. Under one or other of these descriptions, all
        who receive the above doctrines must be convinced that every individual
        of the human race is included. Whence comes it, then, that so many
        venture to set aside the obvious import of these words, ‘Jacob have I
        loved, but Esau have I hated? ’ The term reprobation has been used,
        then, because it expresses the idea intended, which the term rejection
        does not; if any are offended at it, it is to be feared that the offense
        taken is not at the word, but at its import.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless men reject the Bible, they must admit that all were condemned in
        Adam; and if they were justly condemned, there can be no injustice in
        leaving them in that state of condemnation, and punishing them as
        sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is only from the sovereign good pleasure and love of God that any of
        the human race are saved. He had no such love to the fallen angels, and
        they all perished; nor has He such love to those of the human race that
        shall perish, for He says, ‘Depart from Me, ye cursed, I never knew
        you.’ Men had no more claim upon God for mercy than the angels. Whatever
        may be thought of these things at present, God informs us that there is
        a day coming when His righteous judgment shall be revealed. Then He will
        be clear when He speaketh, and just when He is judged. No one shall then
        feel that he has been treated unjustly. Happy they whose high
        imaginations are cast down by the proclamation of mercy in the Gospel,
        and who receive the kingdom as Little children, becoming fools that they
        may be wise. The high imaginations of all will be cast down at last, but
        with very many it will be too late, except to make them feel their
        condemnation to be juSt. In strict conformity with the truths contained
        in the above verses, it is said in the Westminster Confession of Faith,
        which contains so scriptural a summary of Christian doctrine: — ’The
        almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God, so
        far manifest themselves in His providence, that it extendeth itself even
        to the first fall, and all other sins of angels and men, and that not by
        a bare permission, but such as hath joined with it a most wise and
        powerful bounding, and otherwise ordering, and governing of them, in a
        manifold dispensation, to His own holy ends; yet so, as the sinfulness
        thereof proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God, who, being
        most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approver of
        sin.’ ‘The decrees of God are His eternal purpose, according to the
        counsel of His will, whereby, for His own glory, He hath fore-ordained
        whatsoever comes to pass. God executeth His decrees in the works of
        creation and providence. God’s works of providence are, His most holy,
        wise, and powerful preserving and governing all His creatures and all
        their actions.’ And again, ‘God, the great Creator of all things, doth
        uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things,
        from the greatest even to the least, by His most wise and holy
        providence, according to His infallible foreknowledge, and the free and
        immutable counsel of His own will, to the praise of the glory of His
        wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and mercy.’ ‘By the decree of God, for
        the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestinated
        unto everlasting life, and others fore-ordained to everlasting death.’
        In these articles it is asserted that God fore-ordained, decreed, and
        willed the existence of all the evil which ‘comes to pass.’ It is also
        said that God brings His decrees or His will into effect by creation and
        His governing providence, by which, in the exercise of His wisdom and
        holiness, He powerfully governs His creatures, and superintends and
        directs, disposes and orders, all their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the above truths, so well expressed in the Westminster
        Confession of Faith, to which so many profess to adhere as containing
        their creed, everything without exception, great and small, that has
        ever taken place, or shall ever take place in heaven, or on earth, or in
        hell has from all eternity been ordained by God, and yet so that the
        accountableness of the creature is not in the smallest degree removed.
        This is declared in the clearest manner respecting the greatest sin that
        ever was committed, even the crucifying of the Lord of glory. It took
        place according to the express ordination of God, yet the wickedness of
        those by whom it was perpetrated is explicitly asserted. ‘Truly the Son
        of man goeth, as it was determined; but woe unto that man by whom He is
        betrayed’ Luke 22:22. ‘Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel
        and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
        crucified and slain.’ ‘Who by the mouth of Thy servant David hast said,
        Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? The kings
        of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the
        Lord, and against His Christ. For of a truth against Thy holy child
        Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the
        Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together, for to do
        whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined before to be done,’ Acts
        2:23, 4:25. The crucifixion, then, of the Messiah was ordained by God,
        ‘according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus our
        Lord,’ Ephesians 3:11, and was carried into execution by the wickedness
        of men, while God was not the author or actor of the sin. f53 Every
        objection that can be made against the ordination of God respecting any
        wicked act, lies equally against these last two declarations. The
        crucifixion of Christ was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
        of God. If, then, the doctrine be chargeable with the consequences which
        some attribute to it, the admission of it in one case is just as
        impossible as in every case. It makes no difference how many evil
        actions are ordained, if it be admitted that one was ordained. The
        ordination of that one event must have been without reproach to the
        holiness of God, and this shows that the ordination of all others may be
        equally so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — Even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews only, but also
        of the Gentiles?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hitherto the Apostle had been showing that the promise of God was never
        made to the carnal seed of Abraham. This argument he began, ver. 6, 7,
        and had continued it till he comes to these words, in which he plainly
        states who are the true seed of Abraham and the children of the promise,
        even the called of God of all nations. The natural and easy manner in
        which, after several exemplifications, Paul here in a direct manner
        reverts to the main purpose of his discussion, ought not to be
        overlooked. Here he shows who are those vessels of mercy to whom he
        referred in the preceding verse. They are not only Jews but also
        Gentiles, and none of either Jews or Gentiles but those who are called
        by the Spirit and word of God. After expressing his unfeigned sorrow for
        the rejection of the Messiah by his countrymen in general, Paul had
        intimated at the 6th verse, that, notwithstanding this, the word of God
        had not been altogether without effect among them. He had next declared
        the reason why this effect had not been produced on the whole of them,
        namely, that all who belonged to that nation were not the true Israel of
        God, nor because they were descended from Abraham were they all his
        spiritual seed. This he had proved by the declarations of God to
        Abraham, and also by His dealings in regard to him, and especially
        respecting Isaac. In Isaac’s family God had in a remarkable manner
        typically intimated the same truth, and displayed His sovereignty in
        rejecting the elder of his sons, and choosing the younger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul had further proved that this was according to God’s usual manner of
        proceeding, in showing mercy to some, and hardening others. God had,
        notwithstanding, endured with much long-suffering that great multitude
        of the people of Israel who proved themselves to be vessels of wrath
        fitted for destruction; and, on the other hand, had displayed the
        abundance of His free grace in preparing vessels of mercy both among
        Jews and Gentiles. The word of God had thus been effectual by His
        sovereign disposal to some among the people of Israel, corresponding
        with the examples which Paul had produced from their history; and in the
        exercise of the same sovereignty God had also prepared others among the
        Gentiles on whom He displayed His mercy. None of the Jews or Gentiles
        were vessels of mercy, except those whom He had effectually called to
        Himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse incontestably proves, contrary to the erroneous glosses of
        many, that the Apostle is here speaking of the election of individuals,
        and not of nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — As He saith also in Osee, I will call them My people, which
        were not My people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse, the Apostle had spoken of those who were called
        among the Jews and the Gentiles, whom God had prepared unto glory. In
        this verse and the following, he shows that the calling of the Gentiles
        was not an unforeseen event, but that it was expressly foretold by the
        Prophets. God, by the Prophet Hosea 2:23, alluding to the calling of the
        Gentiles by the gospel says, I will say to them which were not My
        people, Thou art my people; that is, the Lord, at the period alluded to,
        would call to the knowledge of Himself, as His people, persons who were
        formerly living in heathenish, not having even the name of the people of
        God. And her beloved, that was not beloved. — The Jewish nation was
        typically the spouse of God. The Lord had betrothed Israel. But when
        Christ should come, He was to betroth Gentiles also, and to call her
        beloved that had not been beloved. Paul therefore shows, by this
        quotation, that the calling of these Gentiles as vessels of mercy was
        according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel
        of His own will — according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in
        Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was
        said unto them, Ye are not My people; there shall they be called the
        children of the living God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the nations which formerly served idols, and of whom it was
        usually and truly said that they were not God’s people, there will be
        those of whom it shall be said that they are the children of the living
        God, Hosea 1:10. They shall be the children of the living God, in
        opposition to the dead idols or gods of their own imagination, which
        they formerly worshipped. This proves that, in their former state, they
        were without God in the world, Ephesians 2:12, 4:18; and consequently
        that the Scriptures hold out no hope for those Gentiles who are left
        uncalled by the Gospel. This awful truth, though so many are unwilling
        to receive it, is everywhere testified in the Scriptures. It is held
        forth in what is said of the empire of Satan, the God of this world; and
        also in the character everywhere given in Scripture of heathens, who are
        declared not to have liked to retain God in their knowledge, and to have
        been ‘haters of God.’ It is also held forth in all the passages that
        affirm the final doom of idolaters; as likewise in all that is taught
        respecting access to God by Him who is the Way, and the Truth, and the
        Life; for there is no other name given among men whereby we must be
        saved. Men may devise schemes to extend the blessings of salvation to
        those who never heard of Christ, but they are opposed to the plain
        declarations of His word. How thankful, then, ought we to be that we
        have lived not in the days of our heathen fathers, when God suffered
        them to walk in their own ways, but in the times when the Gospel has
        visited the Gentiles! How thankful, above all, if we have been made
        indeed the children of the living God! The nations of Europe are in
        general called Christians; but it is only in name that the great body of
        them bear that title. God will not recognize any as His children who are
        not born again of His Spirit, and conformed to the image of His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 27. — Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of
        the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be
        saved: Having spoken in the 24th verse of those whom God had called,
        both among Jews and Gentiles, and having referred in the two preceding
        verses to what had been foretold of the Gentiles, the Apostle, in the
        verse before us and the two that follow, introduces the predictions
        relative to the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
        He quotes the Prophet Isaiah, as loudly testifying the doctrine which he
        is declaring. Hosea testifies with respect to God’s purpose of calling
        the Gentiles; and Isaiah, in the passage here quoted, 10:20-22,
        testifies of the rejection of the great body of the Jews, and of the
        election of a number among them comparatively small. The Israelites
        looked on themselves as being all the people of God, and on the Gentiles
        as shut out from this relation. The Prophet here shows that out of all
        those vast multitudes which composed their nation, only a remnant were
        to be among the number of the true Israel of God. Whatever fulfillment
        the prophecy had in the times of the Old Testament, this is its full and
        proper meaning, according to the Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first sight, it might seem that the Prophet speaks only of the return
        of the Jews from the captivity of Babylon; but, in regard to this, two
        things must be remarked. One is, that all the great events that happened
        to the Jews were figures and types, representing beforehand the great
        work of redemption by Jesus Christ. Thus the deliverance of the
        Israelites from Egypt, their passage through the Red Sea, and through
        the wilderness, the passage of Jordan, and their entrance into Canaan,
        were representations of what was to take place under the Gospel as is
        declared, 1 Corinthians 10:11, ‘Now all these things happened unto them
        for examples (types), and they are written for our admonition, upon whom
        the ends of the world are come.’ Hence it follows that the deliverance
        from the captivity of Babylon, and consequently the predictions
        respecting it in Scripture, are typical of the future condition of the
        Church of Christ. This prophecy, then, has two meanings, — the first
        literal, the second mystical. The other thing to be remarked is, that in
        the work of God in regard to His Church, there being several gradations
        which follow each other, it often happens that the Prophets, who viewed
        from a distance those future events, join together many of them, as if
        they related only to one and the same thing, — which is a characteristic
        of the spirit of prophecy. The Prophet, then, in this place joins the
        temporal re-establishment of the Jews with the spiritual building up of
        the Church of Christ, although these two things are quite distinct and
        separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        These words in this prophecy, ‘They shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy
        One of Israel, in truth,’ can only have their full accomplishment in
        believers in Jesus Christ. The same is the case respecting the words,
        ‘The remnant shall return;’ for this returning or conversion denotes
        much more than that of the return of the Jews from Babylon — even that
        glorious turning to God which takes place by the Gospel. And when the
        Prophet says, Though Thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
        remnant of them shall return it is clear that this is an allusion to the
        promise made to Abraham, that his posterity should be as the sand of the
        sea, and that he means to say that whatever confidence the Jews might
        place in that promise, taking it in a carnal and literal sense, yet that
        those who were saved would be a small remnant, whom God would take to
        Himself in abandoning all the rest to His avenging justice. As one
        event, then, in Scripture prophecy is often made to shadow forth and
        typify another, so the events of the Jewish history are made to
        illustrate the spiritual things of the kingdom of God. In this way the
        prophecies quoted in the New Testament from the Old are to be viewed,
        and not to be explained in a manner which ascribes to the Apostles of
        Christ that false and deceitful mode of quotation called accommodation,
        so disparaging to their character as stewards of the mysteries of God,
        and so degrading to the Holy Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — For He will finish the work, and cut it short in
        righteousness; because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This refers to God’s judgments poured out upon the Jews for rejecting
        the Messiah. They were then cut off manifestly from being His people. He
        cut short the work in righteous judgment. The destruction determined,
        denotes the ruin and desolation of the whole house of Israel, with the
        exception of a small remnant. It was to overflow in righteous judgment,
        which gives the idea of an inundation. But this not having place in the
        re-establishment of the Jews after the Babylonish captivity, must
        necessarily be understood of the times of the Gospel. It was then that
        the consumption decreed took place; for the whole house of Israel was
        rejected from the covenant of God, and consumed or dispersed by the fire
        of His vengeance by the Roman armies, with the exception of a small
        remnant. Formerly God had borne with them in their sins; but now, when
        they had heard the Gospel and rejected it, they were destroyed or
        carried away into captivity as with a flood. The Lord made a short work
        with them at the destruction of Jerusalem. This verse and the preceding
        confirm what is said in the 22nd verse, that although God endures the
        wicked for a time, He determines to punish them at last with sudden and
        overwhelming destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 29. — And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had
        left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrah.
      </p>
      <p>
        This, again, verifies another prediction of Isaiah 1:9. It was no doubt
        fulfilled in the events of the Jewish history; but in its proper and
        full sense, it extended to the times of the Messiah, and predicted the
        small number of Jews who were left, and the purpose for which they were
        left.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews who escaped destruction at the overthrow of their city by the
        Romans, were spared merely as a ‘seed’ from whence was to spring all the
        multitudes who will yet arise to Jesus Christ out of the seed of
        Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had it not been for this circumstance, not one individual at that time
        would have been left. They would have been all cut off as Sodom and
        Gomorrah. ‘Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
        be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened,’
        Matthew 24:22. Instead of remnant, the word employed by the Prophet, the
        Apostle substitutes the term seed, from the Septuagint translation,
        which, though the expression is varied, has a similar meaning, implying
        that after the whole heap besides was consumed, the remainder was
        reserved for sowing with a view to a future crop.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this quotation from Isaiah, the Apostle proves that the doctrine of
        the unconditional election of individuals to eternal life — that
        doctrine against which such objections are raised by many — far from
        being contrary to the ideas we ought to entertain of the goodness of
        God, is so entirely consistent with it, that except for this election,
        not one of the nation of Israel would have been saved. Thus the doctrine
        of election, very far from being in any degree harsh or cruel, as many
        who misunderstand it affirm, is, as we see here, a glorious
        demonstration of Divine goodness and love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had it not been for this election, through which God had before prepared
        vessels of mercy unto glory, neither Jew nor Gentile would have escaped,
        but all would have remained vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. In
        the case of the angels who sinned there was no election, and the whole
        were cast down to hell Had there been no election among men, the whole
        must in like manner have perished.
