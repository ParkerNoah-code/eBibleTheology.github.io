      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
        disputations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Him that is weak in the faith receive ye. — In this verse, and onwards
        to the 13th of the following chapter, the Apostle, as in the 8th and
        10th chapters of First Corinthians, establishes the duty of mutual
        forbearance among Christians. The subjects of dispute often vary, but
        the principles here laid down are always the same. The discussion in
        this chapter regards things in themselves indifferent, as the observance
        of certain days, and the abstinence from certain kinds of food; the
        errors, however, into which we may fall respecting them, are represented
        as springing from weakness of faith, to which every evil that appears
        among Christians may be traced.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may here remark that, though faith is the gift of God, yet it is on
        that account no less a duty. Repentance and every good work are also
        gifts of God, Acts 5:31; 2 Timothy 2:25; Ephesians 2:10. All men,
        notwithstanding, are bound to believe, to repent, and to obey, under
        pain of God’s most awful displeasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calvin, Dr. Macknight, and Mr. Stuart, and others, with almost general
        consent, take it for granted that the weak are the Jewish, and the
        strong the Gentile, believers. There is no ground in the text for this
        opinion. Many of the Jews might be fully instructed in the points which
        are here treated, and many of the Gentiles might be weak with respect to
        the defilement of meats offered in sacrifice to idols. Why should it be
        thought that the Jewish believers in general should be uninstructed, and
        that every Gentile believer should be fully acquainted with his duty
        respecting meats? Some of them might in this easily adopt the prejudices
        of the Jews, and others might have prejudices of their own. To confine
        what is left general by the Apostle, must be useless, and in some cases
        very hurtful. Faith. — Faith here regards the doctrine of the Gospel as
        a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improper views of any part of it always imply something defective with
        respect to its nature. But partial ignorance may be consistent with so
        much knowledge as is connected with salvation. Dr. Macknight paraphrases
        this as referring to the Jewish Christian who is weak in the faith
        concerning meats and days. But how does this consist with the 2nd verse,
        which represents the weakness as confining itself to eating herbs?
      </p>
      <p>
        This was no injunction of the Mosaic law. The weakness referred to is
        weakness of any kind, and will apply to anything in which it is
        discovered. The meats and days are particular instances adduced as
        illustrations of the general truth; but that truth applies as directly
        to weakness of any kind now, as to a weakness of a particular kind at
        that time. Receive ye. — That is, into the Church, to the fellowship of
        the brethren, in all the ordinances of Christ’s house. Doubtful
        disputations. — The phrase in the original is variously rendered and
        explained. The meaning seems to be, that when they should receive a weak
        brother, they should not press him to receive their views by harassing
        discussions on the points on which he is ignorant. Such conduct would
        either tend to wound his mind, or induce him to acquiesce without
        enlightened conviction. Disputation seldom begets unanimity. If a
        statement of the will of Christ from the Scriptures has not the effect
        of producing conviction, lengthened discussions are more likely to
        increase prejudice than to resolve doubts. While, therefore, it is
        greatly important that believers, who have inadequate views of any part
        of Divine truth, should be taught more fully the way of the Lord, it is
        also true that the most likely way to effect this is to avoid
        disputations with them on the points in which they are weak. This
        observation is founded on experience, and it is warranted by the command
        of God. To push them forward faster than they are taught by the word and
        Spirit of God, will stumble and injure instead of making them strong.
        Christians seldom argue one another into their views, and more
        frequently each is more confirmed in his own opinion. When it is
        necessary to show the weak brother his errors, it is best to exhibit the
        truth in its evidences, to leave him to the general use of the means of
        edification, and to give him affectionate instructions, for the purpose
        of his becoming stronger in the faith, and riper in his judgment, by the
        internal influences and teaching of the Holy Spirit. The principles on
        which the Apostle proceeds are not, that the views of those who differ
        among themselves are equally well founded, but that they are all
        brethren, having in view the glory of God and obedience to His will, and
        that, as their heavenly Father is so indulgent to His children, that,
        notwithstanding their defects in knowledge, and the consequent
        difference in their conduct, they ought not to be less forbearing to one
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — For one believeth that he may eat all things; another, who is
        weak, eateth herbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For one believeth that he may eat all things. — ’ The Gentile
        Christian,’ says Dr. Macknight, ‘believeth that he may eat every kind of
        meat.’ But why the Gentile? The Jewish Christian might believe this as
        well as the Gentile, when the distinction of meats was now totally
        abolished. And doubtless many Jewish believers already understood this
        matter. This shows that the Jewish law, in its ritual ordinances, was
        abolished before this time, for otherwise neither Jew nor Gentile had
        ground for such belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems also to imply that the prohibition of blood, in Acts 15, was
        only as a law of forbearance to spare the prejudices of the Jews. When
        the Mosaic law was at an end, there appears to have been no reason for
        abstaining from blood more than from flesh. Here the strong in faith
        believed that they might eat all things; why, then, should blood be
        excepted? If there had been an exception, doubtless it would have been
        given here. How could the strong in faith believe that they might eat
        all things, if one thing was forbidden on its own account? Another, who
        is weak, eateth herbs. — Why should this be confined to the Jewish
        Christians? It is not in evidence that all Jewish Christians were so
        ignorant. Besides, this does not apply to their law. The law of Moses
        did not restrict the Jews to herbs. If it be replied that they abstained
        from all meat, lest it should have been offered in sacrifice to idols
        previously to bringing it to market, it is answered that this applies to
        the Gentile as well as to the Jew? This, besides, does not refer to the
        distinction of meats by the law, but to the pollution of meats by being
        offered to idols. It affected the meats allowed by the law as well as
        the meats prohibited. The opinion, then, of the pollution of meats, by
        the mere circumstance of having been offered to idols as a sacrifice,
        before it was sold in the shambles, might as readily be entertained by
        the Gentiles as by the Jews. The thing that they are thus represented as
        guarding against, is not the breach of the law with respect to the
        distinction of meats, but against the pollution of meats by idolatry.
        This concerned the Gentile equally with the Jew; and weakness in this
        point might be found in the former as well as in the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
        not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the peculiar sin to which each of the two characters is
        respectively liable, is pointed out. The pride of knowledge is prone to
        hold the ignorant in contempt. ‘The weakness of ignorance is prone to
        condemn those who, from more enlightened views of Divine truth, are not
        affected by their scruples. They who could eat everything, without
        exception, were strong, because they had just views on the subject in
        question. Their temptation was to despise their brethren for their
        weakness. This they are forbidden to do. They who thought it unlawful to
        eat certain things were weak, because they had inadequate views of the
        subject. They, therefore, were under a temptation to judge unfavorably
        of the motives of their brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us observe, it is the brethren they are forbidden to condemn, and
        not the thing which they did. They could not but condemn the thing as
        wrong which they thought unlawful. But they were not permitted to
        condemn those who did the thing, as if they did it from improper
        motives, as from the desire of gratifying the appetite, from
        unwillingness to practice self-denial, or from a wish to conform to the
        world and avoid reproach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weak Christians are often troublesome, by ascribing the conduct of their
        brethren to improper motives. The weak, then, are as liable to judge
        improperly as the strong are to despise them. They ought both to attend
        to the apostolical injunctions which are respectively given to them in
        this place. For God hath received him. — God had no doubt received both
        of them as righteous in His sight, through the righteousness of His Son.
        But receiving here being asserted of the one and not mentioned with
        respect to the other, must respect the thing in which he is condemned by
        this weak brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that the distinction of meats, with the whole of the law of
        Moses, in all its ritual ordinances, was abolished; for the conduct of
        Christians could not be received or accepted by God, as far as it was in
        violation of His law. Receiving, then, here does not, as is generally,
        if not universally, explained, refer to receiving their persons through
        Jesus Christ, but to the particular conduct in question. The strong were
        received in their using things prohibited by the law, because the law
        was abolished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had not the word receiving this reference, it would be as applicable to
        the weak as to the strong, whereas it is here affirmed only of the
        strong. But though the weak are accepted with God through the
        righteousness of Christ, this weakness is not acceptable to Him. It is
        an error, and cannot be pleasing to God. And accordingly the strong, and
        not the weak, are here said to be accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own
        master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is
        able to make him stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? — It is generally
        supposed that the person who condemns here is the strong believer, and
        the person who is condemned is the weak. But this is altogether without
        foundation. They were the weak who condemned the strong, and not the
        strong who condemned the weak, in the 3rd verse. The strong did not
        condemn, but despised the weak. When, therefore, in this 4th verse, the
        Apostle indignantly asks, Who art thou that condemnest another man’s
        servant? it must apply to him who was previously represented as having
        condemned the strong. Had it referred to the strong, it would not have
        been said, Who art thou that condemnest? but ‘Who art thou that
        despisest?’ The weak condemned the strong, as if they were not at all
        believers. In this they were accordingly to blame. They assumed the
        prerogative of God, who alone is the Judge of His own servants. To his
        own master he standeth or falleth. — Dr. Macknight, and after him Mr.
        Stuart, translate this, ‘by his own master,’ and understand the words as
        asserting that the person stood or fell by his Master’s sentence. But as
        the standing in the end of the verse appears to refer to the standing in
        the profession of Christianity, and not in the day of judgment, the
        common translation is to be preferred. The servant is said to stand or
        fall to his master, because it is to his master that he is accountable.
        Yea, he shall be holden up. — This man, who is condemned as an
        unbeliever, or one who would soon fall from the faith, would be held up
        or made to stand. It was the almighty power of God that would hold him
        up, and not the observance of the precepts of the Mosaic law. For God is
        able to make him stand. — Here the certainty of his standing is rested
        on God’s ability to hold him up — not on his own ability to stand. The
        strong are as liable to fall as the weak. Nothing can hold up either but
        the power of God. This is important, as showing that a man’s standing is
        not in himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also important, as it secures the standing of the true disciple.
        This standing is as sure as God’s power; for it is rested on God’s
        ability to make him stand. To say, then, that any of God’s children
        shall finally fall, is to say that God is unable to hold them up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth
        every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day. —
        Here what had been said respecting meats is equally applied to the
        observance of certain days. The Apostle takes for granted that on this
        subject likewise different Christians held different views. For it is of
        believers only he is speaking. This is a clear point, but it is one of
        much practical importance. It recognizes the Christianity of those who
        may be very inadequately acquainted with the will of Christ. It is
        proper, however, to remark that the Lord’s Day cannot (which shall
        afterwards be shown) be included in what is here said, as the Apostle is
        speaking of those meats and days that were peculiar to the Jewish
        dispensation; as when, in writing to the Galatians, he censures their
        observing days, and months, and times, and years, to which they desired
        to be in bondage, which he terms weak and beggarly elements, Galatians
        4:9,10.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord, and he
        that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that
        eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth
        not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. — This regard of
        days, though contrary to what had been already revealed, was, from
        ignorance of this fact, intended as obedience to the Lord. The persons
        who made this distinction, believed that the Lord required it.
        Therefore, though they were wrong in this, and on that account were
        guilty, yet they acted from a view of serving the Lord. The thing
        performed may be wrong, while the intention of performing it may be
        right. In like manner, the thing performed may be right, while the
        motive of performing it may be wrong. He that regardeth not the day, to
        the Lord he doth not regard it. — In the same manner, the believer who
        did not regard the day, acted from a view of honoring the Lord, and not
        from thinking the observance of the day a restraint. When he gave up the
        day, which under the Mosaic dispensation was holy, because he believed
        that the Lord had made an end of that dispensation, it was honorable to
        the Lord. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord. — The same thing is
        asserted with respect to meats as was asserted with respect to days. He
        that eateth the thing that formerly had been forbidden, eateth to the
        Lord, because he believes that the Lord hath abolished the distinction.
        He also who would eat what he bought in the shambles, without any
        respect to its having been previously offered in sacrifice to idols,
        because he knew that the meat was the Lord’s, and could not be defiled
        by such an occurrence, did so out of regard to the honor of the Lord.
        That he acted from this view, is proved by his giving God thanks for
        what he did eat. Had he considered that the thing was prohibited by the
        Lord, he would not have ventured to give God thanks for permitting him
        the use of it. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not. — In
        like manner, the weak brother, who not only abstained from the things
        formerly forbidden, but even from everything that he considered as
        polluted, by being offered to idols, acted from a desire of honoring the
        Lord, because he thought such things were forbidden by God. And giveth
        God thanks. — Mr. Stuart understands this of thankfulness ‘for the light
        which is imparted to him,’ as he supposes, ‘with respect to making such
        a distinction in food.’ But the meaning undoubtedly is, that he gives
        God thanks for what he is allowed to eat. He shows that he eats from a
        view of honoring God, because, instead of looking on what he supposes to
        be forbidden as a restraint hard to be submitted to, he gives God thanks
        for what he considers to be granted to him by the Lord. There are other
        places in which the sacred writers exhort believers to grow in
        knowledge, and where they charge them as culpable if ignorant of any
        part of the will of the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here the Apostle’s object is to show that those who have a
        reverential regard for the authority of Christ, and a true knowledge of
        His character, and thus call Him their Lord, ought to be received and
        recognized as His disciples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
        For none of us liveth to himself: — Having stated that both parties
        referred to acted with a view to serve the Lord, the Apostle now extends
        this duty so as to embrace all Christians in all their actions. No
        Christian liveth to himself. As far as he lives to himself, he acts
        inconsistently with his character. We ought to consider ourselves as
        under law to God in every action of our lives. Even in temporal things,
        yea, even in eating and drinking, we should have in view the glory of
        God. To live to the Lord supposes that in all things we regard His will
        as the sole rule of our conduct, and His approbation as our great aim in
        all that we do, and that in all things we seek His glory. It supposes
        that we are entirely resigned to His disposal, blessing Him whether in
        adversity or prosperity; that we submit to His dispensations in what He
        gives or takes away; and, finally, that we only live to serve Him, and
        show forth His praise. Whether, then, the Christian lives or dies, he
        belongs to the Lord, desiring that He may dispose of him as He sees
        best; confident that, as being the object of the Savior’s love, whatever
        may befall him, he is safe in His hands. There is no danger, then,
        however great, — there is no difficulty, however arduous, — that ought
        to prevent us from obeying the will of the Lord. Property, character,
        life itself, ought to be at His service. But is it not obvious that most
        people have no conception of living but to themselves? Do not the mass
        of mankind follow their own interest to the neglect of the authority of
        God? Even among those who make a profession of religion, how few are
        there who follow the Lord at the expense of any great temporal
        sacrifice?
      </p>
      <p>
        Nay, are not many induced to act inconsistently with the character of a
        Christian for every trifle? And no man dieth to himself — A Christian is
        not to die to himself more than he is to live to himself. He has no
        right to yield his life as a sacrifice to his pride. This cuts off the
        pretensions to Christianity of all persons who, to comply with the laws
        of honor, risk their life, or that of their opponents, in dueling. So
        also is suicide here condemned. The man who dies in these ways, dies to
        himself, which no man has a right to do, and which no Christian will do.
        This shows, also, that if obedience to Christ requires it, a Christian
        must not decline to die to His honor. He is to risk his life rather than
        break any known commandment of God. He is to die rather than decline
        obedience to any command or institution of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he so dies, he does not throw away his life. He devotes it for a
        sufficient purpose. He gives it to the honor of the Lord. He yields it
        back to Him who gave it, and who has a right to it. He shows also that a
        Christian should not only be willing to die, when God wills his death,
        but that he should be willing to live as long as God pleases. Christians
        may transgress by being unwilling to die, and they may also transgress
        in wishing to die. They ought to be willing to live or die as it is for
        God’s glory from this it also appears that the death of any Christian is
        precious in the sight of God, as well as his life. Every Christian, when
        he dies, dies to the glory of God. This accords with what is said with
        respect to Peter, ‘by what death he was to glorify God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we
        die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live, therefore, or die, we are
        the Lord’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        For whether we live, we live unto the Lord. — The former verse denies
        that we live or die to ourselves; by inference, therefore, we live or
        die to Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this verse makes the assertion directly which was implied in the
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both in life and death we ought to serve God, and endeavor to promote
        His glory. The end of the verse draws the conclusion. Whether we live,
        therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s. — Not only are we the Lord’s in
        giving our life at His command, but we are the Lord’s in the state of
        separation between soul and body. Our bodies are the Lord’s, and will be
        preserved by Him till the resurrection, when in glory they shall be
        given back to us; and our souls, in the presence of God, will have
        happiness and glory till that period shall arrive.

        Ver. 9. — For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that
        He might be Lord both of the dead and living.
      </p>
      <p>
        For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived. — It was the
        end of the death and resurrection of the Lord, that to Him, as Mediator,
        all power might be committed. He has received the keys of the invisible
        state and of death, and governs all His people both during their life
        and after their death, ordering all things for His own glory and their
        good. Christ, then, is the Lord of the living; He is also the Lord of
        the dead. He must then be God. This shows, also, that the dead are alive
        in their souls, while their bodies are dead. It is in this way that
        Christ reigns over them. It would be absurd to suppose that He reigns
        over them as mere insensible matter. ‘God is not the God of the dead,
        but of the living,’ Matthew 22:32.

        Ver. 10. — But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
        naught thy brother? for we shall all stand at the judgment-seat of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at naught thy
        brother? — This shows, evidently, that the word judge in the 4th verse
        refers to the weak brother who condemned those who did eat things
        prohibited by the law, and not to the strong brother, for he is reproved
        for despising and not for judging. Here both the one and the other are
        brought distinctly forward, and each separately asked a question
        suitable to himself. The brother who thinks that it is wrong to eat
        things prohibited by the law is asked why he dares to take upon himself
        to condemn his brother who in this differed from him; and the brother
        who is better informed upon this matter is asked how he dares set at
        naught his brother who was ill instructed on this point. Mr. Stuart is
        certainly wrong in making both these questions refer to the strong
        brother. There could be no ground for asking the first question with
        respect to the strong brother. He is charged as despising. He might
        despise without condemning his weak brother as acting from improper
        motives. The Apostle most evidently asks the two questions with respect
        to different characters, and the questions are most appropriate and
        suitable respectively to the two characters brought into view. For we
        shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ. — The Apostle gives
        here another reason to prevent believers from judging or despising each
        other. Not only are they all the servants of Christ, and brethren, but
        they must all appear at His judgment-seat, each to give an account of
        himself. This is a good reason why they should neither condemn nor
        despise one another. To judge one another in this manner is to invade
        the prerogative of Christ; and to despise one another evidences pride
        and ignorance of the source of all our knowledge. This most clearly
        shows that Christians have no authority over one another’s faith or
        Christian practice in this world. Both as to faith and Christian
        practice Christians may endeavor to enlighten one another; but when they
        fail, they have no authority to force others to change their views. Each
        Christian, however, is bound to follow the Lord fully so far as his own
        knowledge extends, and not to be stopped by the ignorance of his
        brother. He is not to do what he knows to be wrong, in order to walk
        with his weak brother; nor is he to avoid doing anything that he judges
        to be the will of his Master, in order to retain fellowship with other
        Christians.

        Ver. 11. — For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee
        shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        For it is written. — This passage from the Old Testament, Isaiah 45:23,
        the Apostle adduces as importing that all shall stand before the
        judgment-seat of Christ. It is remarkable that the Apostle so frequently
        quotes from the Old Testament in support of what he teaches, though in
        reality his own authority was equal to that of any writer of the Old
        Testament. But this proves that the Old Testament and the New are given
        by one Spirit, and harmonize in all their parts. It is also an example
        for us in proving and teaching any truth contained in the word of God.
        If the Apostle confirmed what he taught by the authority of the
        Scriptures, shall any man now, or body of men, presume to make the
        authority of their office stand in the place of the word of God? As I
        Live. — The Apostle does not take the words literally; but as the Holy
        Ghost spoke by him, we are assured that he gives the true meaning I have
        sworn by myself , is substantially the same with as I Live. Uninspired
        translators must not be indulged with a like liberty, for it is only
        when they translate exactly that there is an assurance that they
        translate correctly. Saith the Lord. — The Apostle, by the addition of
        these words, shows that in the passage he quotes it was the Messiah who,
        in the preceding verse, said, ‘Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the
        ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else,’ Isaiah 45:22.
        Every knee shall bow to Me. — As in Philippians 2:10 the same thing is
        asserted with respect to Christ personally, this is also applicable to
        Christ personally and directly. In judgment all will bow to God, seeing
        they will bow to Christ. Every tongue shall confess to God. — This is
        substantially the same with ‘unto Me every tongue shall swear.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Epistle to the Hebrews we learn that God swears by Himself,
        ‘because He could swear by no greater;’ and thus Jesus Christ, in here
        swearing by His life, of by Himself, gives, according to that
        declaration of the Apostle, a proof of His divinity. In the preceding
        verses of this chapter it is always to Jesus Christ that Paul refers
        when he says the Lord. It is by Him that we shall be judged at the last
        day; it is to Him that Christians are entirely devoted, which, were He
        merely a creature, would evidently be a violation of the law of Him who
        says, ‘I am a jealous God,’ and ‘My glory I will not give to another.’
        ‘The Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the
        Son: that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
        He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father which hath sent
        Him.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        So then. — Consequently then, or by consequence then. This is an
        inference which the Apostle draws from the passage quoted from the Old
        Testament. Every individual of the human race must give account of
        himself to God. This applies to believers as well as to others. And
        though all their sins are blotted out through the blood of atonement,
        they should not indulge themselves in sin. The fact of a future judgment
        ought to have a constant influence on our conduct. Standing before the
        judgment-seat of Christ, of which the Apostle had just before spoken, is
        here represented as giving an account to God.
