      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        THIS chapter presents a glorious display of the power of Divine grace,
        and of the provision which God has made for the consolation of His
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Apostle had proved, in the sixth, that his previous doctrine
        gave no license to believers to continue in sin, he had still kept in
        view his main purpose of establishing their free justification. In the
        seventh he had prosecuted the same object, declaring that by their
        marriage with Christ they were delivered from the law as a covenant of
        life or death, while he vindicated its character, use, and authority. In
        this chapter, he continues the subject of justification, and resumes
        that of the believer’s assurance of his salvation, of which he had
        spoken in the fifth, establishing it on new grounds; and from the whole
        train of his argument from the commencement of the Epistle, he now draws
        the general conclusion, that to them who are in Christ Jesus there is no
        condemnation. While this could not have been accomplished by the law, he
        shows that it had been effected by the incarnation of the Son of God, by
        whom the law has been fulfilled for all who are one with Him as members
        of His body. Paul next points out the difference of character between
        those who, being in their natural state under the law and under sin, are
        carnally-minded; and those who, being renewed by grace, in whom the law
        has been fulfilled, are spiritually-minded. The condition of the former
        is death, that of the latter life and peace. Of these last he proceeds,
        through the remainder of the chapter, to assert the high privileges and
        absolute security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who are spiritually-minded have the Spirit of Christ, and possess
        spiritual life. Although their bodies must return to the dust, they
        shall be raised up again. They are led by the Spirit; they are the sons
        of God, and in His service are delivered from a spirit of bondage. They
        look to Him as their Father; are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus
        Christ. To encourage believers to sustain the sufferings to which, while
        in this world, they are exposed, the most varied and abundant
        consolations are exhibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their salvation is declared to have taken its rise in the eternal
        counsels of God, by whom, through all its steps, it is carried into
        effect. Their condemnation, then, is impossible; for who shall condemn
        those whom God justifieth, — for whom Christ died, and rose, and
        intercedes? The Apostle concludes by defying the whole universe to
        separate believers from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. In
        this manner he follows out, in this chapter, what had been his grand
        object through all the preceding part of the Epistle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
        Christ Jews who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore. — This is an inference from the general strain of the
        doctrine which the Apostle had been teaching in the preceding part of
        the Epistle; especially it follows from what he had asserted, in the
        sixth and seventh chapters, with respect to believers dying with Christ,
        and consequently being dead to sin and to the law. Now no condemnation.
        — This implies that there would have been condemnation to those to whom
        he wrote, had they remained under the law; but now, since they have died
        with Christ, and thereby given complete satisfaction to the law, both in
        its penalty and precept, it is not possible that by it they can be
        condemned. And, to mark the completeness of this exemption, he says,
        there is now no condemnation to them; the reason of which he fully
        explains in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th verses. This now, then, distinguishes
        two conditions of a man, namely, his condition under the law, and his
        condition under grace, — that is, his natural and his supernatural
        conditions. For by nature we are children of wrath, but now God has
        rendered us accepted in the Beloved. Being now in Christ, we are not
        under the curse of the law, because He has borne it for us In the moment
        in which we believed in Him, we were redeemed from its curse; we entered
        into another covenant, in which there is nothing but grace and pardon.
        That there is now no condemnation to them that are in Him is according
        to our Lord’s declaration, ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
        heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting
        life, and ‘shall not come into condemnation.’ It is often remarked that
        the Apostle does not say that there is in them which are in Christ Jesus
        neither matter of accusation nor cause of condemnation; and yet this is
        all included in what he does say. In themselves there is much indeed for
        both, but here they are viewed exclusively in Jesus Christ. Afterwards,
        in express terms, he denies that they can be either accused or condemned
        — which they might be, were there any ground for either. All that was
        commendable in them, which was sin, has been condemned in their Surety,
        as is shown in the 3rd verse. To them. — The Apostle, discoursing in the
        preceding chapter of the remainder of sin in believers, speaks of
        himself in his own person, in order to show that the highest advances in
        grace do not exempt from the internal warfare which he there describes.
        But in this verse he changes the number, and does not say, there is no
        condemnation to me, but to them, who are in Christ Jesus. This was
        proper, lest believers, who are often disposed to deprive themselves of
        those consolations which the Scriptures present, and prone either to
        despair or to presume on account of their own righteousness, should say
        that such a declaration was right and suitable in an Apostle, who
        enjoyed peculiar privileges, but it did not follow that they could say
        of themselves, ‘There is for us no condemnation.’ Paul therefore here
        changes the expression, and speaks in general terms, to show that he
        ascribes nothing peculiar to himself, but that he refers to the general
        condition of believers, in order that each of them might apply to
        himself the fruit of this consideration. In the seventh chapter he had
        spoken of himself to prove that the holiest among men have reason to
        humble themselves before God, and to acknowledge that, if God should
        view them in themselves, they would be found to be a body of death, —
        that is to say, guilty of eternal death. But here he does not speak in
        his own person, in order that we may not doubt that he refers to the
        condition of believers in general. Again, in the 4th verse, he speaks of
        the righteousness of the law being fulfilled in us; thus showing that
        the unspeakable blessing of deliverance from condemnation equally
        belongs to all the people of God. In the 2nd verse, for an obvious and
        important reason, as we shall presently see, he reverts again to the
        singular number, and says, ‘hath made me free.’ This manner of
        expressing himself ought to be particularly noted; for we are certain
        that, in the word of God, nothing of this kind occurs without a purpose.
        Which are in Christ Jesus. — To be in Christ Jesus is to be one with
        Him, as united to Him by faith. Those and those only who are the one
        with Him are the persons to whom there is no condemnation. All who are
        not in Christ Jesus are under the law and its curse. It is not here said
        that Christ is with His people, or at their right hand, but that they
        are in Him, in order that they may know that, being in Him, they have
        nothing to fear; for what evil can reach those who are one with the Son
        of God? This union is represented in Scripture by various terms and by
        many similitudes; its efficacy and power are shown, when it is said, ‘He
        that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit.’ It is in virtue of this union
        that the sufferings and obedience of Christ are imputed to His people,
        they being one with Him who fulfilled the law, and satisfied the justice
        of God. Their union with Him is the source of that spiritual life by
        which they are quickened together with Christ, and from which they
        derive their justification, their sanctification, and consolation. ‘It
        is impossible,’ Luther remarks, ‘for a man to be a Christian without
        having Christ, and if he has Christ, he has at the same time all that is
        in Christ. What gives peace to the conscience is, that by faith our sins
        are no more ours, but Christ’s, upon whom God hath laid them all; and
        that, on the other hand, all Christ’s righteousness is ours, to whom God
        hath given it. Christ lays His hand upon us, and we are healed. He casts
        His mantle upon us, and we are clothed; for He is the glorious Savior,
        blessed for ever.’ This union was typified under the law in the person
        of the high priest, who carried on his breast the twelve stones, on
        which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
        Israel; so that, when he appeared before God, all the people appeared in
        him, thus showing that all believers are before God in Jesus Christ,
        their great High Priest. They are all delivered from condemnation, as
        being one body with Christ. As the debts of a wife must be discharged by
        her husband, and as, by her marriage, all her previous obligations are
        at once transferred to him, so the believer, being married to Christ, is
        no longer exposed to the curse of the law. All its demands have been met
        and satisfied by His covenant Head, with whom, as the wife is one with
        the husband, so he is one.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is by the human nature of Jesus Christ that we enjoy union with His
        Divine nature, and that He is Emmanuel, God with us. His humanity is the
        medium by which His divinity communicates itself with all its graces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the former dispensation, God communicated with His people through
        the ark of the covenant, which was a type of the human nature of Jesus
        Christ, in order to show us that by it we have union with the whole of
        His person. And by union with the person of Jesus Christ we obtain
        communion with the Father. ‘At that day ye shall know that I am in My
        Father, and you in Me, and I in you.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not by nature that we enjoy this union, since by nature we are
        ‘children of wrath’ and ‘without Christ.’ The means by which we are
        united to Christ are on His part by His Spirit, and on our part by
        faith. He communicates His Spirit to us, which is as the soul that
        unites all the members of the body with the head, so that ‘he who is
        joined unto the Lord is one Spirit.’ On our part we receive Jesus Christ
        by faith produced in us by His Spirit, in order that we may reciprocally
        receive Him in our hearts. He dwells in our hearts by faith; and thus we
        learn what is meant when it is said we are justified by faith, not as
        being a work, or anything meritorious, but as the medium through which
        His righteousness, and all the graces and blessings that are in Jesus
        Christ, are communicated to our souls. ‘Faith,’ says Luther, ‘unites the
        soul with Christ as a spouse with her husband. Everything which Christ
        has, becomes the property of the believing soul: everything which the
        soul has, becomes the property of Christ. Christ possesses all blessings
        and eternal life: they are thenceforward the property of the soul. The
        soul has all its iniquities and sins: they become thenceforward the
        property of Christ. It is then that a blessed exchange commences: Christ
        who is both God and man, Christ who has never sinned, and whose holiness
        is perfect, Christ the Almighty and Eternal, taking to Himself, by His
        nuptial ring of faith, all the sins of the believer, those sins are lost
        and abolished in Him; for no sins dwell before His infinite
        righteousness. Thus, by faith, the believer’s soul is delivered from
        sins, and clothed with the eternal righteousness of her bridegroom
        Christ. O happy union! The rich, the noble, the holy Bridegroom takes in
        marriage his poor, guilty, and despised spouse, delivers her from every
        evil, and enriches her with the most precious blessings. Christ, a King
        and a Priest, shares this honor and glory with all Christians. The
        Christian is a king, and consequently possesses all things; he is a
        priest, and consequently possesses God; and it is faith, not works,
        which brings him all this honor. A Christian is free from all things,
        above all things, faith giving him richly all things.’
      </p>
      <p>
        On account of this union, all believers bear the name of Christ, being
        that of their Head. ‘For as the body is one, and hath many members, and
        all the members of that one body being many, are one body; so also is
        Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body,’ 1
        Corinthians 12:13. ‘We are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
        bones,’ Ephesians 5:30. And in this Epistle to the Ephesians, the
        Apostle denominates the Church not only the body of Jesus Christ, but
        even His fullness. God ‘gave Him to be the Head over all things to the
        Church, which is His body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all,’
        Ephesians 1:22. He thus shows that this union with Jesus Christ is such
        that He who filleth all things would consider Himself without His people
        to be imperfect and incomplete. Who walk not after (according to) the
        flesh, but after (according to) the Spirit. — These words not being
        found in all the manuscripts, are considered by some as spurious. But
        they connect perfectly well with the preceding clause of the verse, as
        characterizing those who are in Christ Jesus. In no respect, however, do
        they assign the cause of exemption from condemnation to them who are in
        Christ. The Apostle does not say, because they do not walk, but who
        walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. There is an essential
        difference between asserting the character of those who are freed from
        condemnation, and declaring the cause of their being delivered from it.
        These words refer to the proof of our justification, which proceeds from
        the efficacy of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, who applies the merit of
        the blood of Jesus, and imparts a new and eternal life, opposed to sin
        and corruption, which the Scriptures call death in sin, for the minding
        of the flesh is death, but the minding of the Spirit is life. In this
        way, then, we may be assured that we are in Christ Jesus, and that there
        is no condemnation to us, if we experience the effects of His Spirit in
        our hearts causing us to walk in holiness. For the life which Jesus
        Christ has merited for us on the cross, consists not only in the
        remission of sins, which is a removal of what is evil, but also in the
        communication of what is good, namely, in our bearing the image of God.
        The same words as in the clause before us occur again in verse 4th, in
        which their genuineness is not disputed, where their full import shall
        be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
        free from the law of sin and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse, as is evident by the particle for , is connected with the
        preceding. It connects, however, with the first part of that verse,
        where the great truth of which it is explanatory is announced, assigning
        the reason why there is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus;
        which is continued to the middle of the 4th verse, in the latter part of
        which the last clause of the first is repeated. On the supposition of
        that clause being genuine, the Apostle follows here the same method as
        in the second chapter of this Epistle, where the 14th verse connects
        with the first part of the 12th. Many, by the phrase ‘law of the Spirit
        of life,’ understand the commanding influence of the Holy Spirit in the
        sanctification of the believers to be intended, and by ‘the law of sin
        and death,’ the corrupt principle, or power of sin in them, as in
        chapter 7:23 and 25. But these explanations do not suit the context. The
        main proposition contained in the preceding verse is, that to them who
        are in Christ Jesus there is no condemnation. But why is there no
        condemnation?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it because they are sanctified? No; but because by their union with
        Christ they have been freed from the law and its curse, as the Apostle
        had shown in the preceding chapter, verse 4. Besides, it is not true
        that believers are delivered from the law of sin that is in them as
        respects their sanctification, which would contradict what Paul had just
        before said of the Christian’s internal warfare with sin, as exhibited
        in his own experience, to which deliverance he looked forward, but which
        he had not yet obtained. It is further to be observed, that the above
        explanations do not accord with the two following verses, which point
        out the ground of that freedom from condemnation which is here asserted,
        being explanatory of the verse before us, declaring that sin has been
        punished in Christ, and that the righteousness which the law demands has
        been fulfilled by Him in those who belong to Him. Law of the Spirit. —
        Various significations belong to the term law, according to the
        connection in which it stands, and to which it is applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the conclusion of the preceding chapter, and in the verse before us,
        where it occurs twice, it is employed in three different senses. In the
        first of these it is denominated the ‘law of sin,’ namely, the strength
        of corruption acting with the force of a law. In the end of the verse
        before us, where the term ‘death’ is added to that of sin, it imports
        the moral law, the transgression of which is sin, and the consequence
        death, and is employed in the same sense in the two following verses. To
        the law of the spirit of life belongs a different meaning, signifying
        the power of the Holy Spirit, by which He unites the soul to Christ, in
        whose righteousness as being thus one with Him, it therefore partakes,
        and is consequently justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law is the Gospel, whereof the Holy Ghost is the author, being the
        authoritative rule and the instrument by which He acts in the plan of
        salvation. It is the medium through which He promulgates Divine
        testimony, and His commands to receive that testimony, and exerts His
        power to produce this effect; by which, also, He quickens and enlightens
        those in whom He dwells, convinces them of their sin and of the
        righteousness of Christ, and testifies of the almighty Savior, whom God
        hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood. The
        Gospel may thus be properly denominated the law , or power of the Holy
        Spirit, because, as a law has authority and binds to obedience, so the
        Gospel bears the stamp of Divine authority to which, in all that it
        reveals, we are bound to ‘submit,’ ch. 10:3. It requires the obedience
        of faith, and for this end is to be made known to all nations, ch. 1:5,
        16:26; and when men refuse this submission, it is said that they have
        not ‘obeyed the Gospel,’ ch. 10:16. Although, therefore, the Gospel is
        proclaimed as a grace, it is a grace accompanied with authority, which
        God commands to be received. Accordingly it is expressly called a ‘law,’
        Isaiah 2:3; Micah 4:2. ‘Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word
        of the Lord from Jerusalem.’ In the Book of Psalm it is again and again
        called ‘ the law;’ and in <19B002> Psalm 110:2, referring to the power
        exerted by its means, it is said, ‘The Lord shall send the rod of thy
        strength out of Zion,’ that is, the Gospel. ‘Rule Thou in the midst of
        Thine enemies,’ namely, by Thine almighty power. The Gospel, then, is
        the law of the Spirit by which He rules, and the rod of His strength, or
        His power, by which He effects our salvation, just as, in chapter 1:16,
        it is denominated ‘the power of God unto salvation.’ The Gospel is
        itself called ‘the Spirit,’ as being ministered by the Holy Spirit, 2
        Corinthians 3:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel is the law of the Spirit of life, the ministration of which,
        being committed to the Apostles, ‘giveth life,’ in opposition to the
        ‘letter,’ or old covenant that killeth, 2 Corinthians 3:6. ‘It is the
        Spirit that quickeneth,’ John 6:63, as it is said, ‘I shall put My
        Spirit in you, and ye shall live,’ Ezekiel 37:14. In the First Epistle
        to the Corinthians 15:45, the Apostle speaks of two sources of life. He
        says, ‘The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made
        a quickening spirit.’ By the living soul is meant the principle of
        natural life which we derive from Adam by natural generation. The
        quickening spirit refers to the heavenly and supernatural life
        communicated by the Holy Spirit from Jesus Christ. The reason of the
        comparison is, that as Adam, receiving a living soul, his body was made
        alive; in like manner, believers, receiving in their souls the Spirit of
        Christ, receive a new life. It is not meant that the Spirit of Christ is
        not also the author of natural life, Job 33:4. Jesus Christ is the life
        itself, and the source of life to all creatures. But here the life
        referred to is that life which we receive through the Gospel, as the law
        or power of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, which the Apostle calls
        ‘the life of God,’ Ephesians 4:18.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus . — Jesus Christ is set
        before us in two aspects, namely, as God, and as Mediator. As God, the
        Spirit of life resides essentially in Him; but as Mediator, and having
        in that character satisfied the justice of God by His death, the Spirit
        of life has been given to Him to be communicated to all who are one with
        Him. On this account the Spirit was not given in His fullness, John
        7:39, till Jesus Christ as Mediator had entered into heaven, to appear
        in the heavenly sanctuary with His blood, when the Father, solemnly
        receiving His satisfaction, gave this testimony of His acceptance, in
        pouring out the abundance of the Spirit on His people. Jesus Christ
        accordingly says, ‘It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go
        not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will
        send Him unto you,’ John 16:7. And the Apostle declares that ‘God hath
        blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ,’
        Ephesians 1:3. He says, ‘spiritual blessings,’ because he speaks of the
        graces of the Holy Spirit. He says, ‘in Christ,’ because it is through
        the Mediator, and in His communion, that our spiritual life and those
        graces are bestowed on us. He adds, ‘in heavenly places,’ because, as
        anciently the high priest entered the sanctuary with the blood of the
        sacrifice, in order that God, in accepting that blood, might bestow His
        blessing on the people; in like manner, Jesus Christ, our great High
        Priest, has entered the heavenly sanctuary, that, being accepted, He
        should, as Mediator, and so receiving the Holy Spirit, be the source of
        life, even of that spiritual and eternal life to which He rose from the
        dead, and of all grace, to communicate it to His Church. This is what
        His forerunner John teaches when he says that ‘God giveth not the Spirit
        by measure unto Him,’ and is the reason why it is said that He was ‘full
        of grace and truth,’ and that ‘of His fullness we have all received, and
        grace for grace.’ The Apostle John, too, speaks of the anointing which
        believers have received from Jesus Christ; for as the oil was poured on
        the head of the high priest, and ran down to the skirts of his garments,
        in like manner Jesus Christ has been anointed with the Holy Spirit, as
        He says, ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed
        Me;’ and this anointing was to be poured out on all His body, which is
        the Church.

      <p>
        That the Spirit of life, then, is in Jesus Christ, not only as God, but
        also as Mediator, is a ground of the most unspeakable consolation. It
        might be in Him as God, without being communicated to men; but, as the
        Head of His people, it must be diffused through them as His members, who
        are thus complete in Him. Dost thou feel in thyself the sentence of
        death? — listen, then, to the testimony of the Scriptures concerning
        Him. ‘This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life; and
        this life is in His Son.’ ‘I am come that they might have life.’ He that
        believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever
        liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die.’ ‘Because I live, ye shall
        live also.’ ‘I am that bread of life; he that eateth of this bread shall
        never die.’ ‘I am the resurrection and the life.’ ‘This life, then, is
        in Jesus Christ, and is communicated to believers by the Holy Spirit, by
        whom they are united to Christ, and from whom it is derived to all who
        through the law of the Spirit of life are in Him. It is on this account
        that, in the passage above quoted, Corinthians 15:45, Jesus Christ, as
        Mediator, is said to be made a quickening spirit. In obtaining this
        life, the believer receives his justification, the opposite of
        condemnation, which without this life cannot subsist, and from which it
        cannot be separated. Law of sin and death. — In the preceding chapter,
        verses 23 and 25, ‘the law of sin,’ which the Apostle says he served
        with the flesh, signifies, as has been observed, the powerful corrupt
        principle in the heart, operating with the force of a law. But in the
        former part of the same chapter, the word ‘law’ is employed to denote
        the moral law. It is there spoken of as the law of God, which, though
        holy, and just, and good, is to fallen man the occasion both of sin and
        death; and, accordingly, in the point of view in which the Apostle is
        here regarding it, it is called ‘the law of sin and death.’ It may be
        called the law of sin, since without it sin could not exist; for ‘sin is
        the transgression of the law,’ 1 John 3:4; but ‘where no law is, there
        is no transgression,’ and ‘sin is not imputed when there is no law,’
        Romans 5:13. ‘The motions of sin are by the law,’ Romans 7:5; and ‘the
        strength of sin is the law,’ 1 Corinthians 15:56. ‘By the commandment
        sin becomes exceeding sinful,’ Romans 7:13. ‘The law entered that the
        offense might abound,’ Romans 5:20. As, therefore, sin could have no
        existence but by the law, and as the law is the strength of sin, and
        makes it to abound, the law may, as here, be properly denominated ‘the
        law of sin.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The holy law may also be called the law of death. It threatens with
        death in case of disobedience, and on account of transgression adjudges
        to death. ‘The commandment,’ says the Apostle, ‘which was ordained to
        life, I found to be unto death.’ It brings the sinner under the penalty
        of death. ‘In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’ The
        law ‘killeth;’ and the ministration of the law, written and engraved on
        stones, was death, 2 Corinthians 3:6,7. By the law ‘death reigned from
        Adam to Moses,’ Romans 5:14; and the wages of sin, which is the
        transgression of the law, is death. Since, then, the law of God, which,
        though it commands holiness, gives the knowledge of sin, and the breach
        of it is death, and since, without the law, there could neither be sin
        nor death, it may, without arguing the smallest disrespect or
        disparagement to the holy law, be called the law of sin and death. That
        it is so denominated in the verse before us, appears from the repetition
        of the term law in the beginning of the following verse, evidently in
        connection with that in the end of this verse, where the reference is
        clearly to the moral law, namely, the law which had been spoken of from
        the 4th to the 13th verse of the foregoing chapter, which the Apostle
        had there shown, as he asserts in verse 3 of this chapter, could not set
        free from sin and death. Besides, that by the law of sin and death is
        here meant the moral law, appears unquestionable, when it is considered
        that if the same meaning be attached to it as belongs to the phrase ‘the
        law of sin’ in the conclusion of the preceding chapter, the Apostle must
        be held to have contradicted himself. For in that case he bitterly
        laments his being under the power of the law of sin, and speaks only of
        his hope of future deliverance; and here, in the same breath, he
        unqualifiedly asserts his freedom from it. Notwithstanding, then, the
        similarity of these two expressions, and their juxtaposition, it is
        impossible, without charging a contradiction on the Apostle, to assert
        that he attached the same meaning in both places to the word law, which
        in different connections is capable of significations quite distinct.
        Hath made me free. — The reason why there is no condemnation to them
        which are in Christ Jesus is, that being in Him they have been made free
        from the law of sin and death, all its requirements having been
        fulfilled by Him in them, as is affirmed in verse 4. This freedom is
        likewise declared in 2 Corinthians 3:17, in which passage it is said,
        ‘Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.’ ‘If the Son
        therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.’ Me free. — Here
        it is to be observed that the Apostle, instead of speaking generally of
        believers, as he does in the first and fourth verses, saying ‘them’ and
        ‘us,’ changes, as has been above remarked, the mode of expression, and
        refers to himself personally — ’hath made me free.’ A very striking
        contrast is thus pointed out between his declaration in the 24th verse
        of the preceding chapter, and that contained in the verse before us.
        There, he is speaking of the power of sin, which operates in believers
        as long as they are in this world. Here, in reference to condemnation,
        he is speaking of the guilt of sin, from which they are perfectly freed
        the moment they are united to the Savior. In the former case, therefore,
        where he speaks respecting sanctification, he refers in verse 24th to
        his deliverance as future, and exclaims, ‘Who shall deliver me?’ In
        reference to the latter, in which he is treating of justification, he
        speaks of his deliverance as already obtained, and affirms, He ‘hath
        made me free.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The following explanation of the verse before us is given in the
        Westminster Confession of Faith. ‘Albeit the Apostle himself (brought in
        here for example’s cause), and all other true believers in Christ, be by
        nature under the law of sin and death, or under the covenant of works
        (called the law of sin and death, because it bindeth sin and death upon
        us, till Christ set us free); yet the law of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,
        or the covenant of grace (so called because it doth enable and quicken a
        man to a spiritual life through Christ), doth set the Apostle, and all
        true believers, free from the covenant of works, or the law of sin and
        death; so that every man may say with him, ‘The law of the Spirit of
        life,’ or the covenant of grace, hath made me free from the law of sin
        and death, or covenant of works,’ ed. 1773, p. 434.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every believer should take to himself all the consolation which this
        verse contains, and with Paul he may with confidence say, ‘The law of
        the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin
        and death.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, however, will say, We should be happy indeed if we could, with
        Paul, adopt this language; but what assurance can we have of being free
        from condemnation, and of being in Christ Jesus, since the flesh is so
        strong in us and the spirit so weak, — since we are still prone to so
        many sins, and subject to so many defects? Assuredly if a man is
        satisfied in sinning and following carnal desires, and is not desirous
        to turn from these ways, he has no ground to conclude that he is freed
        from condemnation, for such is not the state of any believer. But if, on
        the other hand, he groans on account of his sins, crying out with the
        Apostle, ‘O wretched man that I am;’ if they displease him, if he have a
        godly sadness on account of having committed them, and earnestly prays
        to God to be delivered from them, he may be assured of his salvation.
        For the Christian is not one who is without sin and evil inclinations,
        as is abundantly shown in the preceding chapters; but one who resists
        and combats against them, and returns to God by repentance. His groans
        on account of his sins, and his meditating on the word of God, — his
        earnest endeavors to be holy and to grow in grace, although not with all
        the success he desires, — are proofs of his regeneration. For if he were
        dead in his sins, he would not be affected on account of them, nor would
        he resist them. And whoever resists the flesh by the Spirit of God, will
        in the end obtain the victory, for the Holy Spirit in us is greater in
        goodness and power than all that is against us, — Satan, and the world,
        and the flesh. All this should inspire the believer with courage to
        fight the good fight of faith, and to follow the movements of the
        blessed Spirit, and the Lord will say to his soul, ‘I am thy salvation,’
        Psalm 35:3; ‘My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made
        perfect in weakness,’ 2 Corinthians 12:9; and he, on the other hand, may
        say with confidence, ‘O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art
        my Lord,’ Psalm 16:2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
        flesh, and sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
        sin condemned sin in the flesh: This verse confirms the interpretation
        that has been given of the preceding, with which it stands connected. It
        is introduced to explain what is said in the two preceding verses. Both
        this and the following verse are illustrations of that great truth, that
        to the believer in Christ there is no condemnation There are here three
        principal considerations: namely, the misery of our natural condition;
        the mercy of God in the incarnation of His Son; and the effect of
        sending Him into the world, which is our redemption. Under these three
        heads, the Apostle removes the difficulties that might present
        themselves from the supposition that, on account of some imperfection in
        the law, it could not justify. In answer to this, it is here shown that
        the imperfection is not in the law, but in us. The law could justify
        those who fulfilled it, as it is said, ‘The man that doeth them shall
        live in them; ‘but the corruption of human nature renders this
        impossible. And as it might be objected that the law, which subjects
        every transgressor to death, is violated by the freedom from it which we
        obtain by the death of Jesus Christ, the Apostle shows that the
        punishment it demands was inflicted upon Him. Hence the first
        proposition, that there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ
        Jesus, is established; and in the following verse it is added, that the
        law, which we were required to fulfill, has by Him been fulfilled in us.
        In this view, the justice of God, which naturally terrifies man,
        inspires us with confidence. For if God is just, will He exact double
        payment and satisfaction? Will He condemn those for whom the Surety has
        borne the condemnation? No; ‘He is faithful and just to forgive us our
        sins,’ for ‘the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all
        sin.’ For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
        Flesh. — The law here meant is the same as that spoken of in the end of
        the preceding verse, namely, the moral law, under which our first
        parents in the state of innocence were placed, and which was afterwards
        promulgated by the ministry of Moses. This law was ordained to life, ch.
        7:10, — that is, to justify man, if he had remained in innocence; but by
        his sinning it condemns him, as the Apostle adds, ‘I found it to be unto
        death;’ so that the law, the breach of which constitutes sin, and which
        on account of this awards death, is now unable to justify, but powerful
        to condemn.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse proves that the method which God takes to justify the sinner
        is entirely consistent with law and justice. Firsts the Apostle shows
        the necessity of this method. For what the law could not do, in that it
        was weak through the flesh. — What is it that the law could not do? It
        could not justify. Mr. Frazer, however, says that the reason of this
        alleged weakness of the law forbids this interpretation. ‘That,’ says
        he, is not the reason why the law cannot justify.’ But surely it is the
        very reason why the law cannot justify. Were it not for the weakness of
        the flesh, or the corruption and sinfulness of man, the law could
        justify. ‘But,’ he continues, ‘to turn the disability of the law to
        justify the sinner upon the corruption of his nature, as the text would
        do, according to the interpretation I am considering, would imply
        something by no means consistent with the Apostle’s clear doctrine,
        viz., that after a person had transgressed he might be justified, even
        by the law, for returning to his duty, and for his subsequent
        righteousness, if the weakness and poverty of his nature, called the
        flesh, did not disable him from doing his duty; which how contrary to
        Scripture doctrine I need not stay to prove, the thing is so clear.’ But
        did this acute and worthy author overlook what our Lord says to the rich
        young man, ‘If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments’? In
        fact, however, the commandments could not be kept unless every
        commandment that respects man is obeyed; therefore the commandment in
        the garden of Eden is included; because, being guilty of breaking it, no
        man can be said to have obeyed God as he ought. The weakness of the
        flesh includes everything that befell us by the fall. Every man is as
        truly accountable for that first sin of Adam as he is for his own
        personal sins; and therefore, as long as he is under condemnation for
        that sin, he cannot be said to keep the commandments. ‘By the law is the
        knowledge of sin.’ It is the test of men being sinners. If it were kept,
        this would prove that we were not sinners. It entered, that the offense
        might abound; and the Lord applied this test for the young man’s
        conviction. Yet what he said was truth: if the young man had kept the
        commandments, he would, as a holy creature, have enjoyed life; he would
        not have been a sinner. But he was so ignorant as to say he had kept
        them all. The Lord replied, ‘One thing thou lackest,’ and said, ‘Follow
        Me.’ If he had really kept the commandments, he would have had no need
        of a Savior; but he was a sinner, and Christ informed him of the only
        way of salvation. The law could not give life to one by whom it was
        forfeited.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weakness of the law through the flesh Mr. Stuart explains thus:
        ‘Because, through the strength of our carnal inclinations and desires,
        it was unable to regulate our lives, so that we should be perfect or
        actually free from sin.’ But as Christ is said to do what the law
        through this weakness could not do, this interpretation supposes that
        Christ has enabled us to regulate our lives so as to be entirely free
        from sin. Nothing can be more obvious than that the weakness of the law
        through the flesh is its inability to justify, as it would have done,
        had not sin entered. The weakness of the law for justification is no
        disparagement to it. It was never designed to save a sinner. How could
        it be supposed that a creature who had apostatized, and was a rebel
        against God, could re-establish himself in the Divine favor? Yet such
        re-establishment, in order to the enjoyment of the favor of God, was
        necessary. A creature in such circumstances could only be re-established
        by God Himself, and that by an act of free and sovereign mercy,
        compatible with His Justice and truth, as well as with the essential
        glory of His character. It is also impossible that mercy could be
        extended in any other way than that which the Gospel reveals. How could
        the justice of God be satisfied but by an atonement of infinite value,
        to meet the infinite evil of sin? And how could such an atonement be
        made for man but by one who was at the same time both God and man — the
        infinite God manifest in human nature? This was the remedy which God
        provided; therefore it was the best remedy. It was the highest possible
        remedy; therefore there could be no other. It would be inconsistent with
        infinite wisdom to employ means greater than are necessary in order to
        accomplish an end. The law was strong to perform its own office, — that
        is, to justify all by whom it was perfectly obeyed. Its weakness was
        through the flesh, — that is, the guilt and corruption of our nature.
        The weakness is not in the law; it is in man. God sending His own Son. —
        God sent His Son to do that which the law could not do. He sent Him in
        consequence of His great love to His people, 1 John 4:9; and as the
        accomplishment of His Divine purpose, Acts 4:28. The object, then, of
        Christ’s mission was not merely that of a messenger or witness; it was
        to effect the salvation of guilty sinners in the way of righteousness.
        He did what the law could not do. The law could justify those only by
        whom it was observed; but it could not justify or save those who should
        violate even the least of its commands. But Christ Jesus both justifies
        and saves the ungodly. His own son — Christ was God’s own Son in the
        literal sense. It is on this supposition only that the sending of Him is
        a manifestation of infinite love to men. There is no more appearance of
        any figurative meaning in the use of this appellation, when ascribed to
        Jesus Christ, than there is when Isaac is called the son of Abraham. He
        is here emphatically called not only the Son of God, but the Son of
        Himself, or His own Son — His very Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether Christ’s sonship is a relation in Godhead, or a figurative
        sonship, has been much disputed. Many who hold the Godhead of Christ
        explain the passages that assert His sonship as referring to His
        incarnation. That the phrase Son of God imports the Divine nature of
        Jesus Christ, there can be no doubt, John 5:18 (see pp. 21-25); and that
        it relates not merely to His incarnation, but to His eternal relation to
        the Father, appears the obvious testimony of Scripture. No reasoning
        from the import of the relation among men can form a valid objection to
        this view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam is called the son of God because he was created by the immediate
        exercise of Divine power. The angels are called the sons of God on
        account of their creation, and the greatness of their condition;
        believers, by the right of their adoption and regeneration; but none
        except the Messiah is called the Only-begotten of the Father. These
        words, ‘I have begotten Thee,’ are indeed applied to Jesus Christ, Acts
        13:33, not with respect to His eternal generation, but to His
        resurrection and establishment in the priesthood; and import that He was
        thus made known to be the Son of God, as it is said, Romans 1:4, that He
        was declared to be the Son of God with power, by His resurrection from
        the dead. The exaltation of Jesus Christ, whether in His office of
        Mediator or in sovereign glory, is the authoritative declaration of the
        Father that He was His Son, His only-begotten Son; and this is signified
        in the second Psalm. There, the elevation of Jesus Christ to the
        sovereign dominion of the world is spoken of. ‘I have set My King upon
        My holy hill of Zion.’ It is as to the act of His elevation that this
        declaration is made. ‘I will declare the decree: The Lord hath said unto
        Me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee.’ Thus, according to
        the usual style of Scripture, things are said to be done when they are
        declared or publicly manifested. When it is said, ‘This day have I
        begotten Thee, the eternal dignity of the Savior, which had been before
        concealed, was brought to light and fully discovered. In the likeness of
        sinful flesh. — Jesus Christ was sent, not in the likeness of flesh, but
        in the flesh. He was sent, however, not in sinful flesh, but in the
        likeness of sinful flesh. Nothing can more clearly prove that the Lord
        Jesus Christ, though He assumed our nature, took it without taint of sin
        or corruption. To His perfect holiness the Scriptures bear the fullest
        testimony. ‘He knew no sin.’ ‘The prince of this world cometh and hath
        nothing in Me.’ He was ‘holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
        sinners.’
      </p>
      <p>
        His absolute freedom from sin was indispensable. As God becoming
        manifest in the flesh, He could not unite Himself to a nature tainted
        with the smallest impurity. He was conceived by the power of the Holy
        Ghost, and did not spring from Adam by ordinary generation; and, not
        belonging to his covenant, had no part in his sin. His freedom from sin,
        original and actual, was necessary, in order that He should be offered
        as ‘a Lamb without blemish and without spot,’ so that He might be the
        truth of His types, the legal sacrifices, which it was expressly
        provided should be free from all blemish; thus distinctly indicating
        this transcendent characteristic of Him who was to be the one great
        sacrifice.

      <p>
        If the flesh of Jesus Christ was the likeness of sinful flesh, there
        must be a difference between the appearance of sinful flesh and our
        nature, or flesh in its original state when Adam was created. Christ,
        then, was not made in the likeness of the flesh of man before sin
        entered the world, but in the likeness of his fallen flesh. Though He
        had no corruption in His nature, yet He had all the sinless infirmities
        of our flesh. The person of man, in his present state, may be greatly
        different from what it was when Adam came from the hand of his Creator.
        Our bodies, as they are at present, are called ‘the bodies of our
        humiliation,’ Philippians 3:21. Jesus Christ was made in man’s present
        likeness. Tradition speaks of the beauty of His person when on earth;
        but this is the wisdom of man. The Scriptures nowhere represent Christ
        in His -manhood as distinguished by personal beauty. No observation of
        this kind, proceeding either from His friends or enemies, is recorded in
        the Gospels. And for sin. — The reason of the mission of our Lord Jesus
        Christ into the world — of His incarnation and humiliation — was the
        abolition of sin, its destruction, both as to its guilt and power. The
        same expression occurs, 1 Peter 3:18, ‘Christ also hath once suffered
        for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God.’ It is
        sin that is the cause of separation from God; and by its removal
        reconciliation is made, and peace restored. Condemned sin in the flesh.
        — Here, by the flesh is meant, not the body of Jesus Christ only, but
        His human nature. In this sense the word flesh is used where it is said,
        ‘the Word was made flesh,’ — that is to say, was made man, and took our
        nature, composed of body and soul. The nature and the person who
        suffered must also be distinguished. Respecting the person, it is Jesus
        Christ, God and man; as to the nature in which He suffered, it is in the
        flesh. Of the person we can say that it is God, as the Apostle says that
        God hath purchased the Church with His own blood, and consequently that
        His suffering was of infinite value, since it is that of an infinite
        person; and this is the more evident, since Jesus Christ is Mediator in
        both His natures, and not in His human nature only. For if this were so,
        His suffering would be finite, since His human nature, in which alone He
        could suffer, by which He offered His sacrifice, was in itself only
        finite; and if He had been Mediator only as to His human nature — which,
        however, could not be, as He represents both God and man — He could not
        have been the Mediator of the Old Testament, when He had not taken the
        human nature. And as it is necessary that, in regard to His person, we
        should consider Jesus Christ suffering, it is also necessary that we
        consider that it was in the flesh that He suffered, — that is to say, in
        our nature, which He took and joined personally to the Divine nature. In
        this we may admire the wisdom of God, who caused sin to be punished and
        destroyed in the human nature, in which it had been committed. Condemned
        sin. — Condemnation is here taken for the punishment of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        God punished sin in Christ’s human nature. This is the method that God
        took to justify sinners. It was God who, by His determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge, Acts 2:23, punished sin by inflicting those sufferings on
        Christ of which men were only the instruments. Sin had corrupted the
        flesh of man, and in that very flesh it was condemned. The guilt and
        punishment of sin are eminently seen in the death of Christ. Nowhere
        else is sin so completely judged and condemned. Not even in hell are its
        guilt and demerits so fully manifested. What must be its demerit, if it
        could be atoned for by nothing but the death of the Son of God? and what
        can afford clearer evidence of God’s determination to punish sin to the
        utmost extent of its demerit, than that He thus punished it even when
        laid on the head of His only-begotten Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all this we see the Father assuming the place of judge against His
        Son, in order to become the Father of those who were His enemies. The
        Father condemns the Son of His love, that He may absolve the children of
        wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we inquire into the cause that moved God to save us by such means,
        what can we say, but that it proceeded from His incomprehensible wisdom,
        His ineffable goodness, and the unfathomable depth of His mercies? For
        what was there in man that could induce the Creator to act in this
        manner, since He saw nothing in him, after his rebellion by sin, but
        what was hateful and offensive? And what was it but His love that
        passeth knowledge which induced the only-begotten Son of God to take the
        form of a servant, to humble Himself even to the death of the cross, and
        to submit to be despised and rejected of men? These are the things into
        which the angels desire to look.
      </p>
      <p>
        But besides the love of God, we see the wonderful display of His justice
        in condemning sin in His Son, rather than allowing it to go unpunished.
        In this assuredly the work of redemption surpasses that of creation. In
        creation God had made nothing that was not good, and nothing especially
        on which He could exercise the rigor of His justice; but here He
        punishes our sins to the utmost in Jesus Christ. It may be inquired if,
        when God condemned sin in His Son, we are to understand this of God the
        Father, so as to exclude the Son; or if we can say that God the Son also
        condemned sin in Himself. This can undoubtedly be affirmed; for in the
        Father and the Son there is only one will and one regard for justice; so
        that, as it was the will of the Father to require satisfaction for sin
        from the Son, it was also the will of the Son to humble Himself, and to
        condemn sin in Himself. We must, however, distinguish between Jesus
        Christ considered as God, and as our Surety and Mediator. As God, He
        condemns and punishes sin; as Mediator, He is Himself condemned and
        punished for sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        When sin was condemned or punished in the Son of God, to suppose that He
        felt nothing more than bodily pain, would be to conclude that He had
        less confidence in God than many martyrs who have gone to death
        cheerfully, and without fear. The extremity of the pain He suffered when
        He said in the garden, ‘My soul is sorrowful even unto death,’ was the
        sentiment of the wrath of God against sin, from which martyrs felt
        themselves delivered. For the curse of the law is principally spiritual,
        namely, privation of communion with God in the sense of His wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, therefore, was made a curse for us, as the Apostle says,
        Galatians 3:13, proving it by the declaration, ‘Cursed is every one that
        hangeth on a tree.’ For this punishment of the cross was the figure and
        symbol of the spiritual curse of God. As in His body, then, He suffered
        this most accursed punishment, so likewise in His soul He suffered those
        pains that are most insupportable, such as are suffered by those finally
        condemned. But that was only for a short time, the infinity of His
        person rendering that suffering equivalent to that of an infinity of
        time. Such, then, was the grief which He experienced when on the cross
        He cried, ‘My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?’ What forsaking
        was this, unless that for a time God left Him to feel the weight of His
        indignation against sin? This feeling is the sovereign evil of the soul,
        in which consists the griefs of eternal death; as, on the other hand,
        the sovereign good of the soul, and that in which the happiness of
        eternal life consists, is to enjoy gracious communion with God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse we see the ground of the Apostle’s declaration, that there
        is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, because their
        sin was punished in Him. This is according to numerous other passages in
        Scripture, as, Isaiah 53:4-6; Galatians 3:13; 1 Peter 2:24; Revelation
        5:9; and, as it is said in 1 Timothy 2:6, ‘who gave Himself a ransom for
        all.’ For our sins are debts of which the payment and the satisfaction
        for them is their punishment — a payment without which we were held
        captives under the wrath and by the justice of God. All this shows that
        sin was really punished in Jesus Christ; and it is evident that,
        according to the justice and truth of God, such a punishment was
        necessary in order to our redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
        who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. That the
        righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us. — God not only sent
        His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might punish sin in
        that nature in which it had been committed, but that all which the law
        demands might by Him be fulfilled in those who are united to Him; for
        which purpose He obeyed its precepts as well as fulfilled its penalty.
        The original word here translated righteousness is the same as is
        rendered judgment or sentence, Romans 1:32, where, and also in the verse
        before us, it is in some of the French versions, and in the Dutch
        annotations, rendered ‘right.’ It is properly here the right of the law.
        The right of the law is twofold, being that which belongs to it at all
        times, or what only belongs to it in the event of sin. The first is
        obedience to its precepts; the second, subjection to its penalty. The
        first, or what may be called the proper right of the law, corresponds
        with its prosper end, according to which it was ordained unto life to
        all who obey it. What it demands beyond its proper or first end, is the
        fulfillment of its penalty, as cursing all who disobey it. For it is not
        the first end of the law to curse men, but only what it demands since
        the entrance of sin. Such is the right of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel does not take away this right; for it does not make void the
        law, Romans 3:31, but establishes it. In those, therefore, who are saved
        by the Gospel, they being all sinners, both the one and the other of the
        rights of the law are fulfilled in Christ, who is the end or fulfilling
        of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth, Romans 10:4.
        His people having sinned, He fulfills its right as to them, in suffering
        the punishment of sin, — namely, the curse of the law, to save them from
        punishment. And to introduce them into life. He accomplishes its proper
        or original right, according to which, as it is said, ‘the man that
        doeth them shall live in them.’ For if the Gospel establishes the law,
        it must do so as to its first end, and it must also do so as to its end
        since the entrance of sin, otherwise the law would, as to those who are
        saved, rather be abolished than fulfilled by the Gospel. In this way
        Christ has fully satisfied the law, having fulfilled its righteousness,
        — all that conformity to it which is its right in every respect, and
        under every aspect, and as to every state of those who are its subjects.
        And as His people are in Him, so the law is thus, in all its extent,
        fulfilled in them, which is the very circumstance in which their
        justification consists. For if they are one body, or one with Him, as
        the Apostle had been showing, His fulfillment of the law is their
        fulfillment of it. Such being their communion with Him, that they sit
        with Him in heavenly places, Ephesians 2:6; and by the same communion
        His righteousness is their righteousness, 2 Corinthians 5:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        The end, then, of Christ’s mission was, that the right of the law might
        be fulfilled in His people. Here we see the ground on which believers
        are saved. It is in a way consistent with the law, a way in which all
        that it has a right to demand is fulfilled in them. The mercy, then,
        which saves sinners does not interfere with justice. They who are saved
        by mercy have that very righteousness which the law demands. In Christ
        they have paid the penalty of their disobedience, and in Christ they
        have yielded obedience to every precept of the law. This fulfillment of
        the law cannot signify, as some commentators erroneously explain it,
        that obedience which believers are enabled to yield by the Holy Spirit
        in their regenerate state; for it is obvious that this is not the
        righteousness of the law. The very best of all their actions and
        thoughts come short of the perfection which the law demands; besides,
        its penalty would in this way be unfulfilled. They are indeed
        sanctified, but their sanctification is far from being commensurate with
        the claims of the holy law, either as to its penalty or its precept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, then, is solid consolation for the believer in Jesus. For,
        divested as he is of righteousness in himself, he enjoys the blessedness
        of having the righteousness of God — the righteousness of his Lord and
        Savior — imputed to Him, so that the law which had been broken is
        fulfilled in him in all its precepts, and in its full penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hitherto, from the beginning of the 2nd verse, the Apostle had been
        illustrating the truth contained in the first clause of the first verse,
        namely, that there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.
        He now repeats the last clause of that verse which he goes on to
        illustrate to the end of the 8th verse. Who walk not after (according
        to) the flesh, but after ( according to) the Spirit. — These words
        characterize those in whom the righteousness of the law is fulfilled and
        serve the double purpose of showing that they who are walking according
        to the principles of the renewed spiritual nature, and according to that
        covenant of which the Lord Jesus is the spirit, are one with Him, and
        that none are united to Him who are living after the principles of their
        corrupt nature, and seeking justification and acceptance with God, by
        cleaving to the covenant of works. The expression, to ‘walk,’ is
        frequently employed in Scripture regarding any particular line of
        conduct, as when it is said, Acts 21:21, ‘that they ought not to
        circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs; ‘or it
        denotes the course of life in which we are proceeding as in Ephesians
        2:2, ‘Ye walked according to the course of this world.’ In this way,
        comparing our life to a journey, in the usual style of Scripture, the
        Apostle comprehends all our actions under the figure of walking. To
        walk, then, according to the flesh, is to act agreeably to the
        principles of corrupt nature. To walk according to the Spirit, means to
        regulate the conduct according to the influence and dictates of the Holy
        Spirit, who has given us a new nature, serving God in newness of spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms flesh and spirit have various significations, and are employed
        in different senses in this chapter. The word flesh is used in a sense
        either bad or indifferent. Sometimes it means simply human nature, and
        sometimes corrupt human nature, or man in his natural state without the
        Holy Spirit, and frequently wicked works. At other times it denotes
        outward services in adherence to the law for justification, Philippians
        3:4. To the word spirit various meanings are likewise attached. It
        imports either the angelic nature, or the soul of man, or the Holy
        Spirit, or the renewed image of the Son of God in the soul. In both of
        these last senses it is employed by our Lord, when, declaring the
        necessity of regeneration, He says, ‘That which is born of the Spirit is
        spirit.’ Sometimes, when opposed to flesh or to letter, it is used as
        equivalent to the new covenant, — ’who also hath made us able ministers
        of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit.’ The
        expression, walking not according to the flesh, but according to the
        Spirit, in the verse before us, is generally interpreted as referring
        exclusively to the practice of good or of wicked works. It is supposed
        that the Apostle is here guarding his doctrine of gratuitous
        justification from abuse, by excluding all claim to union with Christ,
        and to exemption from condemnation, where there is not purity of
        conduct, under the influence of the Holy Spirit. This is undoubtedly a
        highly important truth, which is to be constantly affirmed and insisted
        on. Holiness of life and conversation is an inseparable concomitant of
        union with Christ; for to whom He is made righteousness He is also made
        sanctification, and they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with
        the affections and lusts. Of this the Apostle never loses sight, not
        indeed in any point of view as the cause of that union, but as its
        never-failing consequence and concomitant, as he has abundantly proved
        in the sixth chapter. There are, however, many different paths in the
        broad way; that is, many ways of walking after the flesh, all of which
        lead to destruction. Among these, that of seeking acceptance with God by
        works of righteousness, either moral or ceremonial, is equally
        incompatible with union to Christ and freedom from condemnation, as
        living in the grosser indulgence of wicked works; and this way of going
        about to establish their own righteousness, by those who profess to have
        received the Gospel, and who have even a zeal of God, ch. 10:2, is
        probably that by which the greater number of them are deceived. There is
        the greatest danger lest the fleshly wisdom, under the notion of a zeal
        for God and of regard for the interests of virtue, should set men on the
        painful endeavor of working out their salvation, in part at least, by
        keeping the law as a covenant, thus attending to its requirements for
        justification, serving in the oldness of the letter, and not in the
        newness of spirit. In this ways multitudes who profess to have received
        the Gospel, are walking after the flesh, seeking to satisfy their
        conscience, and saying peace when there is no peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        While, therefore, the other ways of walking according to the flesh may
        all be comprehended under the term as here employed by the Apostle, for
        they are all involved in each other, it would appear (especially as in
        the 5th verse, minding the things of the flesh, which certainly denotes
        immoral conduct, is distinguished from walking after the flesh) that it
        is to the above import of the word, rather than to immoral conduct, that
        he is referring in this place. In this way Paul himself walked before
        his conversion, when he thought that he ought to do many things contrary
        to the name of Jesus of Nazareth; and it was this same way of walking
        according to the flesh which he so strenuously opposes in his Epistle to
        the churches of Galatia. We see, too, how suitable to his purpose it
        would be in confirming the doctrine he had been teaching, particularly
        to direct to this point the attention of those to whom he was writing.
        Paul, then, appears to be here prosecuting his main design, which is to
        prove that believers are to be justified, not by works of righteousness
        which they have done, of whatever description, but solely by faith in
        Jesus Christ, in whom their reconciliation with God is complete. It is
        this grand truth which, from the beginning of the Epistle, he had been
        exhibiting, for the conviction and establishment in the faith of those
        whom he addressed. It is indeed a truth in which Christians need to be
        fully instructed, which they are all apt to let slip out of their minds,
        but by which they are saved, if they keep it in memory. There is nothing
        which so much retards them in their course as their proneness to walk
        according to the flesh, in seeking to establish their own righteousness;
        and nothing more powerfully tends, when giving way to it in any degree,
        to bring them into bondage, to lead them to serve in the oldness of the
        letter, and not in newness of spirit, and to mar their joy and peace in
        believing. In the sense here ascribed to it, the word flesh is employed
        in the beginning of the fourth chapter of this Epistle. Flesh, in that
        place, cannot, it is evident, signify immoral conduct; for that Abraham
        was justified by wicked works could never be supposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It must there signify works, moral or ceremonial, as is proved by the
        rest of that chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Epistle to the Galatians, the terms flesh and spirit are likewise
        used in this acceptation. ‘Are ye so foolish? having begun in the
        Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?’ Galatians 3:3. ‘Having
        begun your Christian course by receiving the doctrine of the new
        covenant, namely, justification by the righteousness of Christ, are ye
        seeking to be made perfect by legal observances, or works of any kind?’
        In this passage the word flesh cannot be taken for wicked works, any
        more than in the fourth chapter of the Romans, just quoted. It must be
        understood in the sense of working for life, or self-justification, in
        opposition to the way of salvation according to the Gospel. The
        Apostle’s main object, in the whole of that Epistle, is to reclaim the
        Galatian churches from the error of mixing ceremonial observances, or
        any works of law, with the faith of Christ, and thus walking according
        to the flesh, and not according to the Spirit. ‘Behold, I Paul say unto
        you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I
        testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to
        do the whole law. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of
        you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from (the doctrine of)
        grace. For we, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by
        faith.’ This reasoning applies to all works of law, of whatever
        description, as clearly appears by the third chapter of that Epistle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same manner, the terms flesh and Spirit are employed, Philippians
        3:3, ‘For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and
        rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the word flesh, opposed to Spirit, just as in the passage before
        us, cannot signify immoral conduct, in which it would be absurd to
        suppose that the Apostle placed confidence. In the sequel, Paul
        furnishes a practical commentary on these words, by referring to his own
        conduct, as having formerly walked according to the flesh, resting in
        external privileges, and observances, and his obedience to the law; but
        afterwards as renouncing them all, and relying solely on ‘the
        righteousness which is of God by faith.’
      </p>
      <p>
        According, then, to the above signification of the word flesh, as
        employed in the fourth chapter of this Epistle, and of the word Spirit;
        denoting the new covenant, 2 Corinthians 3:6, this clause, ‘who walk not
        according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit,’ indicates the
        course of those who are not walking according to the old covenant, in
        seeking justification by the works of law, but who attain it by faith in
        Him who is the Lord the Spirit, 2 Corinthians 3:17. The same idea
        appears to be expressed here as in the preceding chapter, where the
        Apostle reminds believers that they are delivered from the law under
        which, while in the flesh, they were held, that they should serve in
        newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. This is
        consistent with the whole of the previous train of the Apostle’s
        reasoning, in which, as was already noticed, he has been asserting the
        freedom of believers from the law, and their justification by the
        righteousness of Christ through faith, in opposition to all
        self-justifying efforts or obedience of their own. They, then, who walk
        not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, are no longer
        seeking justification by works of law, but are brought to act on Gospel
        and spiritual principles. They live in the Spirit, and they also walk in
        the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        All men who profess to worship God in any form, walk by nature according
        to the flesh. As man was originally placed under the law to live by his
        obedience to it, so, ever since it has been broken, he naturally seeks
        acceptance with God, and justification by the works of law. This is
        fully verified at all times, and in all nations, by those who are not in
        Christ. All men, without exception, have the work of the law written in
        their hearts, and if ignorant of the only Savior of sinners, they
        attempt to satisfy their conscience by means of some religious
        observances or moral works, — the idolater, by his sacrifices; the
        Mohammedan, by his lustrations; the Brahmin, by his austerities; the
        Roman Catholic, by his masses and penances; the Socinian, by his vaunted
        philanthropy; the nominal Christian, by his assiduous attendance at the
        Lord’s Supper and other religious services: and all, in some way or
        other, by the merit of their works, moral or ceremonial, seek to obtain
        their acquittal from sin before God, and a favorable sentence at His
        tribunal. All of them are going about to establish their own
        righteousness, being ignorant of the righteousness of God. In this way
        Saul of Tarsus, as has been noticed, describes himself as having walked,
        when he had ‘confidence in the flesh.’ To wait, through the Spirit, for
        the hope of righteousness by faith, Galatians 5:5, is peculiar to those
        to whom, being in Christ Jesus, there is no condemnation, and in whom
        the righteousness of the law is by Him fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The verse before us, and the three preceding, contain a summary of the
        whole that Paul had advanced in the foregoing part of the Epistle, both
        respecting the justification and the sanctification of believers, and
        open the way for illustrating the difference between those who are
        carnal — remaining in their natural state — and those who are spiritual,
        as renewed by grace. This afterwards leads to a particular and most
        interesting description, through the remainder of the chapter, of the
        various trials of believers, as also of their unspeakably glorious
        privileges, and of the gracious operations and influences of the Holy
        Spirit in the great work of their sanctification, and to the Apostle’s
        concluding the whole by the most sublime view of the eternal source and
        absolute security of the state of dignity and blessedness to which,
        through Divine favor, they have been elevated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — For they that are after the, flesh do mind the things of the
        flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        This appears to confirm the explanation that has been given of the last
        clause of the first verse and of that of the fourth; for the Apostle
        here distinguishes between walking after the flesh, and mining the
        things of the flesh, and between walking after the Spirit, and minding
        the things of the Spirit. As he had proved that union with Christ was
        necessary to justification, he here shows that its certain consequence
        is also sanctification; while they who do not enjoy this union are still
        under the dominion of sin. For they that are after the flesh do mind the
        things of the flesh. — This verse connects with the preceding, and
        contrasts the opposite effects that follow from walking according to the
        flesh, or according to the Spirit. The word here translated ‘mind,’
        includes both the understanding and the affections, and signifies the
        strong bent of the mind regarding the object desired. The minding of the
        flesh comprehends all the faculties of man in his unregenerate state,
        there being no power of the mind exempt from sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, then, a man walks according to the flesh, seeking acceptance with
        God by his own works, moral or ceremonial, however earnest or sincere he
        may be in his endeavors, he will remain under the prevalence and
        dominion of sinful appetites. Such persons have their minds intent on
        the things that gratify their corrupt nature. They have no relish for
        spiritual things; whatever they may be induced to do from dread of
        punishment, or hope of reward in a future world, their desires are, in
        reality, centered in the things of this world. Whatever may be their
        profession of religion, their hearts are supremely engrossed with
        earthly things; and for these, if they could obtain their wish through
        eternity, they would gladly barter all the glories of heaven. In one
        word, they mind the things of the flesh, they love the world, and all
        that is in the world. ‘If any man love the world, the love of the Father
        is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and
        the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but
        is of the world.’ But they that are after the Spirit the things of the
        Spirit. — They who act according to the principles of the renewed
        spiritual nature, and seek acceptance with God by faith in Him who is
        ‘the Lord the Spirit,’ Corinthians 3:17, mind spiritual things. Jesus
        Christ is the source of every blessing, and they who are in Him are not
        only justified, and consequently freed from condemnation, but also walk
        in newness of life. They employ their thoughts and efforts about the
        things of God. To these they attend, and on these their affections are
        fixed. None will seek the things which are above, but those who serve
        God in newness of spirit. All others will ‘mind earthly things,’
        Philippians 3:19.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the verse before us Mr. Adam of Wintringham remarks, ‘For they that
        are after the flesh, that is, according to the common interpretation,
        not led and governed by the Spirit in practice, “still under the
        direction of the flesh and its sinful appetites,” says Mr. Lock, do mind
        the things of the flesh: very true; but then this is only affirming a
        thing of itself, or saying it twice over. And therefore, to clear St.
        Paul of this absurdity, we suppose that by “they that are after the
        flesh,” he means those who are destitute of faith, or not in Christ: and
        of them he affirms that, let them pretend to do what they will, they are
        still under the prevalence of flesh and its appetites, and cannot act
        from a higher principle, or a nature which they have not. And it must be
        observed that he is now advancing a step farther in the doctrine of
        faith, and, besides the necessity of it in order to justification,
        showing its happy effects as a principle of holiness: but they that are
        after the Spirit — in the Spirits dispensation of grace, through faith —
        and say that. Jesus is the Lord by the Holy Ghost, by whom only they can
        say it, mind the things of the Spirit, now possessing and ruling them.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually
        minded is life and peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse the Apostle contrasts the dispositions and
        practices of believers and unbelievers; here he contrasts their opposite
        states and conditions. These two states of carnal and spiritual
        mindedness include and divide the whole world. All men belong either to
        the one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are either in the flesh or in the Spirit; in a state of nature or
        in a state of grace. For to be carnally minded is death. — This is the
        awful state of the carnal mind — the mind of the flesh without faith in
        Christ, and renovation of the Spirit of God. It is death spiritual and
        eternal. All the works of those who are in this state are ‘dead works,’
        Hebrews 9:14. ‘The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the
        Lord,’ although the Lord commanded to offer sacrifices, which therefore
        was in itself a good work. ‘She that liveth in pleasure is dead while
        she liveth.’ All by nature being in this carnal state, are ‘dead in
        trespasses and sins.’ Let those whose minds are set on the things of the
        world consider this fearful saying, that to be carnally minded is death,
        and let them look to Jesus the Savior of the guilty, through whom alone
        they can escape condemnation. But to be spiritually minded is life and
        peace. — These are the effects of being enlightened and guided by the
        Spirit of God, and so having the mind turned from earthly things to the
        things of the Spirit. To be spiritually minded is life, even eternal
        life. This life is already enjoyed by the believer. ‘Whoso eateth My
        flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life;’ and with his Redeemer
        he has risen from the death of sin to walk in this new life. It is also
        peace, both here and hereafter. This peace is the harmony of all the
        faculties of the soul with God, and with His will, and is altogether the
        opposite of that enmity against God, which in the following verse is
        affirmed concerning the carnal mind. While there is nothing so miserable
        for man as war with his Creator, there is nothing so blessed as peace
        and communion with God. It is peace in the conscience, in opposition to
        doubt, for which the Church of Rome contends, as if the effect of being
        spiritually minded, instead of peace and confidence in God, was servile
        fear and harassing distrust. That church maintains that the man who is
        regenerated should doubt of his salvation, and be uncertain of God’s
        love to him. What, then, becomes of this peace that flows from being
        spiritually minded — which passeth all understanding, keeping the heart
        and mind through Christ Jesus — this peace, which is one of the fruits
        of the Spirit, and a characteristic of the kingdom of God? Romans 14:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        The peace here spoken of is opposed to the terrors of conscience which
        the unregenerate experience, and to the opposition in their hearts to
        God, as well as to every species of false peace by which they may be
        deluded. ‘There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.’ And again it
        is said, ‘Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
        Thee, because he trusteth in Thee.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not
        subject to law of God neither indeed can be Because the carnal mind is
        enmity against God. — The word rendered carnal mind — or, as it may be
        rendered, minding of the flesh — comprehends the acts both of the
        understanding and of the will. Some render it the prudence, or wisdom,
        of the flesh — or the wise thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The carnal mind in its wisest thoughts is rooted enmity against God.
        This is the reason why the carnal mind is punished with death. The mind
        of the flesh, or of man in his unconverted state, walking according to
        the flesh, in its best as well as in its worst character — however moral
        in conduct — .whether seeking acceptance with God by its own services,
        or following altogether the course of this world in its sinful practices
        — is not merely an enemy, but enmity itself against God in the
        understanding, will, and affections. Every man whose heart is set on
        this world hates God, John 2:15. ‘If any man love the world, the love of
        the Father is not in him;’ and the heart of every one who has not been
        renewed in his mind by the Spirit of God is set on this world. Such men
        hate the holiness of God, His justice, His sovereignty, and even His
        mercy in the way in which it is exercised. Men of this character,
        however, have no notion that they hate God. Nay, many of them profess to
        love Him. But God’s testimony is, that they are His enemies; and His
        testimony is to be taken against the testimony of all men. This,
        however, does not suppose that men may not imagine that they love God.
        But is it not the true God whom they are regarding, but a God of their
        own imagination — a God all mercy, and therefore a God unjust; while
        they abhor the just God, and the Savior, who is the God of the
        Scriptures. ‘He that cometh to God must believe that He is,’ Hebrews
        11:6. He must believe that He is what He is. For it is not subject to
        the law of God. — The carnal mind is not under subjection to the law of
        God. Whatever it may do to obtain salvation or avoid wrath, it does it
        not from subjection to the law. It has a rooted aversion to the
        spiritual law of God, and admits not its claim to perfect and unceasing
        obedience. All its performances in the way of religion spring from
        selfish motives, and a hope that, on account of these doings, it will be
        accepted; whereas the holy law of God utterly rejects all such service.
        So far from giving the law all its demands, the carnal mind gives it
        nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing which it does constitutes obedience to the law. The law does not
        in any degree, or in any instance, recognize the works of the carnal
        mind as obedience to its requirements. Neither indeed can be. — Not only
        is it a matter of fact that the carnal mind is not subject to the law of
        God, but such subjection is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sin cannot be in subjection to the law. This would be a contradiction in
        terms. For, so far as it would be subject to the law of God, it would be
        holy. If, then, sin is essentially, and in direct terms, contrary to
        holiness, the sinful nature can never yield subjection to the holy law.
        Men may speculate about metaphysical possibilities; but whatever
        explanation may be given of the matter, the decision of the inspired
        Apostle determines that the thing is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        That an unconverted man cannot be subject to the law of God, appears to
        many a hard saying; but it is the uniform doctrine of the word of God.
        All men in their natural state, though they boast that they are free,
        are the slaves of sin. Then Jesus, addressing the Jews who professed to
        believe in Him, but who understood not His doctrine, said to them, ‘Ye
        shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,’ they answered,
        ‘We were never in bondage to any man; how sayest Thou, Ye shall be made
        free?’ In the same manner the unconverted boast of their freedom. They
        affirm that their will is free; and that, as they can choose the evil,
        so they can choose the good. If, by this freedom, they intend that they
        can choose without any external force constraining or preventing them,
        it is true that, in this sense, they are free. But a moral agent chooses
        according to his inclinations or dispositions. It should always be
        recollected that the will is the will of the mind, and the judgment the
        judgment of the mind. It is the mind that judges and that wills. A fool
        judges foolishly; a wicked man judges wickedly; a good man wills that
        which is good. In Scripture, it is said that God cannot deny Himself;
        that He cannot lie. His nature being perfectly holy, it is impossible
        that He can do what is wrong. On the other hand, the wicked and
        condemned spirits cannot choose what is holy. When the devil ‘speaketh a
        lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.’
        Man, therefore, in his carnal state, chooses what is evil; but he cannot
        choose what is good, not indeed because of any external obstruction, for
        in that case he would not be criminal, but by reason of the opposition
        of his perverse dispositions. He is inclined to do evil, and evil he
        will do. ‘Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
        then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.’ His language
        is, ‘I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.’ ‘As for the word
        that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken
        unto thee.’ ‘My people would not hearken to My voice, and Israel would
        have none of Me.’ They say ‘unto God, Depart from us.’ ‘Depart from us;
        for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.’ ‘We will not have this man
        to reign over us.’ ‘Let us break their bands asunder, and cast their
        cords from us.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is thus that ‘wickedness proceedeth from the wicked.’ ‘Neither can a
        corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.’ ‘Wept a man be born again, he
        cannot see the kingdom of God.’ ‘Except a man be born of water, and of
        the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.’ ‘How can ye
        believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that
        cometh from God only?’ ‘No man can come to Me except the Father which
        hath sent Me, draw him.’ ‘Therefore said I unto you, that no man can
        come unto Me except it were given unto him of My Father.’ ‘The natural
        man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
        foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
        spiritually discerned.’ ‘Their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot
        hearken.’ ‘How can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the
        abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.’ ‘The Spirit of truth whom
        the world cannot receive.’ ‘Why do ye not understand My speech? even
        because ye cannot hear My word.’ ‘No man can say that Jesus is the Lord,
        but by the Holy Ghost.’
      </p>
      <p>
        According, then, to Scripture, the natural man is entirely incapable of
        choosing what is good, although it is his duty, and therefore fit that
        it should be enjoined on him. He is ‘ungodly,’ a ‘sinner,’ an ‘enemy to
        God,’ and ‘without strength,’ Romans 5:6,10. Men in this state are
        represented as walking according to the prince of the power of the air,
        the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience; as being
        under ‘the power of Satan,’ and ‘taken captive by him at his will.’ They
        are his lawful captives, because they are so voluntarily. From this
        slavery they cannot be freed but by means of the word of God, the sword
        of the Spirit, which the Lord employs; granting to those to whom it
        seemeth good to Him the blessing of regeneration; ‘distributing His
        gifts, and dividing to every man severally as He will.’ It is God ‘who
        hath delivered us,’ says the Apostle, ‘from the power of darkness, and
        hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.’ ‘Who worketh in
        you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.’ ‘If the Son shall make
        you free, ye shall be free indeed.’
      </p>
      <p>
        When God purposes to do good to men, He fulfills to them this gracious
        promise, ‘I will give them a heart to know Me.’ It was this preparation
        of heart that David prayed to God to grant to his son Solomon. At the
        same time, he acknowledged with gratitude that his own willingness to
        offer to God, of which he was Conscious, and that of his people, were
        from Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After celebrating the praises of Jehovah, David says, ‘But who am I, and
        what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after
        this sort? For all things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given
        Thee.
      </p>
      <p>
        O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for
        ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and
        prepare their hearts unto Thee,’ 1 Chronicles 29:10-18.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nothing to prevent men from obeying the will of God but their
        own depraved dispositions, and aversion to the things of God. The
        natural faculties of men would be sufficient to enable them to do what
        He commands, if they employ them properly. If they employ them
        otherwise, the fault rests exclusively with themselves. And as the
        corruption of our nature does not deprive a man of any of his natural
        faculties, or of perfect liberty to act conformably to the decision of
        his own mind, the obligation under which he lies to do right continues
        in full force. From this we see, first, how justly God punishes men for
        their crimes, who, unless inclined and enabled by His grace, cannot
        liberate themselves from the slavery of sin; and further, that the
        inability of men to obey God, not being natural but moral inability,
        cannot deprive God of the right to command obedience, under the pain of
        His most awful displeasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this subject, the distinction between natural and moral inability
        should always be kept in view. Natural inability consists in a defect in
        the mind or body, which deprives a man of the power of knowing or doing
        anything, however desirous he may be of knowing or doing it. Natural
        inability, then, can never render a man criminal. Moral inability
        consists in an aversion to anything, so great that the mind, even when
        acting freely — that is, without any external impulse or constraint —
        cannot overcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this aversion exists as to what is good, it is inseparable from
        blame; and the greater this aversion is, the greater is the criminality.
        All men are daily accustomed to make these distinctions, and according
        to this rule they constantly form their opinion of the conduct of
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the nature of things, it is impossible that the justice of God can
        ever demand of reasonable creatures less than perfect obedience. To say
        that the moral inability of man to obey the law of God destroys or
        weakens, in the smallest degree, his obligation to obey that law, is to
        add insult to rebellion. For what is that moral inability? It is, as has
        been observed, no other than aversion to God, the depraved inclination
        of the carnal mind, which not only entertains and cherishes enmity
        against God, but is itself that enmity. And let it not be said that the
        view the Scriptures give of the natural depravity of men, and of the
        sovereign and efficacious grace of God, reduces them to the condition of
        machines. Between men and machines there is this essential difference,
        and it is enough for us to know that man is a voluntary agent both in
        the state of nature and of grace. He wills and acts according to his own
        dispositions, while machines have neither thought nor will. As long,
        then, as a man’s will is depraved and opposed to God, his conduct will
        be bad, — he will fulfill the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and,
        on the other hand, when God gives the sinner a new disposition, and a
        new spirit, his conduct will undergo a corresponding change. ‘The
        liberty of a moral agent consists in the power of acting conformably to
        his choice. Every action performed without external constraint, and in
        pursuance of the determination of the soul itself, is a free action. The
        soul is determined by motives; but we constantly see the same motives
        acting diversely on different minds. Many do not act conformably to the
        motives of which they yet acknowledge all the force.
      </p>
      <p>
        This failure of the motive proceeds from obstacles opposed by the
        corruption of the heart and understanding. But God, in giving a new
        heart and a new spirit, takes away these obstacles; and, in removing
        them, far from depriving a man of liberty, He removes that which
        hindered him from acting freely, and from following the light of his
        conscience, and thus, as the Scriptures express it, makes him free. The
        will of man, without Divine grace, is not free but enslaved, and willing
        to be so.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it objected, that if a man be so entirely corrupt that he cannot do
        what is right, he should not be blamed for doing evil? To this it is
        sufficient to reply, that if there be any force in the objection, the
        more a voluntary agent is diabolically wicked, the more innocent he
        should be considered. A creature is not subject to blame if he is not a
        voluntary agent; but if he be so, and if his dispositions and his will
        were absolutely wicked, he would certainly be incapable of doing good,
        and, according to the above argument, he could not be blamed for doing
        evil. On this ground the devil must be excused, nay, held perfectly
        innocent, in his desperate and irreconcilable enmity against God. A
        consequence so monstrous totally destroys the force of the objection
        whence it is deduced. But if the objection be still pressed — if any one
        shall proudly demand, who hath resisted His will?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why hath He made me thus? — the only proper answer is that of the
        Apostle, ‘Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Some, indeed, taking a different and the most common view of this
        matter, deny the innate depravity of their nature, and, in spite of all
        that the Scriptures declare on this subject, persist in maintaining that
        they have not an inclination to evil, and are under no moral incapacity
        to do what is right.
      </p>
      <p>
        To such persons the same reply should be made as that of our Lord to the
        ignorant young man who asked Him what he should do to inherit eternal
        life. ‘If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.’ You cannot
        refuse to admit that this is your duty. You ought to love God with all
        your heart, and soul, and strength, and in all things constantly to obey
        Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you done so? No! Then, on your own principles, you are justly
        condemned, for you say that you can do what is right, and yet you have
        not done it. If, then, you will not submit unconditionally, and without
        reserve, to be saved in the way which the Gospel points out, in which
        you learn at once your malady and the remedy of which you stand in need,
        your blood will be upon your own head. ‘Now, you say, We see; therefore
        your sin remaineth.’ The whole, then, resolves itself into this, that
        all is according to the good pleasure of God. ‘Either make the tree good
        and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt;
        for the tree is known by his fruit. Every good tree bringeth forth good
        fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot
        bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
        fruit. Ye shall know them by their fruits.’ Every man, then, being by
        nature bad, must be made good before he can do good. In this and the two
        preceding verses we observe the strong, and expressive, and accumulated
        terms in which the Apostle describes the alienation of the natural man
        from God. 1st , He declares that they who walk after the flesh, mind the
        things of the flesh; 2nd , That the minding of the flesh is death; 3rd ,
        That the carnal mind is enmity against God; 4th , That it is not subject
        to the law of God; 5th , That so great is the corruption of the carnal
        mind, that this is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the passage before us, we learn how miserable the state of man is
        by nature, since even his wisdom and intelligence, in his unconverted
        state, is enmity against God, so that he cannot submit himself to His
        law. We learn, too, that the ability both to will and to do anything
        good must be from God. We should adore His compassion and mercy to us,
        if our natural enmity against Him has been subdued, and we have been
        reconciled to God by the death of His Son. In proportion to the
        greatness of this compassion, we should place our entire confidence in
        Him as our covenant God. For if, when we were enmity against Him, He
        loved us, how much more now that we are reconciled and His children?
        Romans 5:10. And, since there are still remains of the flesh and enmity
        against God and His holy law in our minds, we ought to deny ourselves
        daily, and flee to Him who can and will entirely deliver us from the
        body of this death.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 8. — So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>
      <p>
        This is the result of what has been said. A man must be born of the
        Spirit before he can even begin to serve God. How unscriptural and
        pernicious, then, is that system which teaches men to seek to please God
        by commencing a religious life, that God may be induced to co-operate
        with them in their further exertions. If the man who is not born again
        cannot please God, every act of the sinner before faith must be
        displeasing to God. An action may be materially good in itself, but
        unless it proceeds from a right motive — the love of God — and be
        directed to a right end — his glory — it cannot be acknowledged by God.
        Before a man’s services can be acceptable, his person must be accepted,
        as it is said, ‘The Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering. ’
        ‘Without faith it is impossible to please God.’ It is by faith we are
        united to Christ, and so reconciled to God; and till this union and
        reconciliation take place, there can be no communion with Him. If, then,
        no man who is in the flesh — that is, in his natural or unconverted
        state — can please God, how dreadful is the situation of those who do
        not even profess to be renewed in the spirit of their mind! How many are
        there who discard the idea of regeneration!
      </p>
      <p>
        However specious may be the works of such persons in the eyes of men,
        they cannot please God; and not pleasing God, they must abide the
        condemnation that awaits all His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — But we are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that
        the Spirit of God and dwell in you. Now, if any man have not the Spirit
        of Christ, he is none of His.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verses the Apostle had given a description of carnal
        and spiritual mindedness. Here he applies what he had said to those whom
        he was addressing. Ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. — As the
        flesh is here taken for the nature of man corrupted by sin, so to be in
        the flesh signifies to be in a state of natural corruption. On the other
        hand, to be in the spirit signifies to be in a state of grace or
        regeneration, John 3:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flesh is a principle that attaches to the earth, and the things of the
        earth; but the spirit of regeneration is as a light, which, coming from
        heaven, elevates the mind to those things that are celestial. As to the
        understanding, the man in the flesh, or the carnal man, receiveth not
        the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness Unto him; but
        he who is in the spirit, or spiritual, knows and approves the will of
        God, having ‘the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
        God,’ ‘the eyes of his understanding being enlightened.’ The will of the
        carnal man is such that the imagination of his thoughts are only evil
        continually; but he who is spiritual his conscience purged from dead
        works to serve the living God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The affections of him who is carnal are enmity against God, and in
        rebellion against His law; but the spiritual man delights in the law of
        God, and loves His commandments. The former considers the things of the
        world as his sovereign good; the latter seeks the things that are above
        at the right hand of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not being in the flesh, but in the spirit, was the state of all in the
        church at Rome. All belonging to it were, as far as man could judge,
        ‘saints,’ ch. 1:7, the regenerated children of God. The Apostle was
        persuaded that they were all ‘his brethren’ in Christ, ‘full of
        goodness,’ ch. 15:14. It was meet for him to think this of them all,
        Philippians 1:7. They were not then in the corrupt state of nature, but
        in the Spirit, walking in the Spirit, renewed by the Spirit of God. How
        different at that period was the church at Rome from that apostate body
        which now usurps its name! Nor only are natural or carnal men recognized
        as its members, but, like the temples of heathenish, it is filled with
        abominations and filthiness. If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in
        you. — The Apostle, in order to confirm those to whom he wrote in the
        assurance of their happy condition, now calls their attention to the
        evidence of being in a converted state, namely, the indwelling of the
        Holy Spirit. ‘Hereby we know that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because
        He hath given us of His Spirit,’ John 4:13. This indwelling of the
        Spirit is a sure evidence of a renewed state; and believers should be
        careful not to grieve the Spirit, and should labor to enjoy a constant
        sense of His presence in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse the word spirit in the first occurrence imports the gift
        and grace of regeneration. In the 2nd and 3rd it denotes the Author of
        that gift, namely, the Holy Spirit, who is Jehovah, a person in the self
        existent Godhead; equal with the Father and the Son in every attribute.
        He is called the Spirit, as being the breather or inspirer of spiritual
        life. Everything done by Him in this character tends to holiness, and
        therefore He is so often called the Holy Spirit. It is His Divine office
        to apply the salvation of Jesus, and to make it effectual. He does all
        in the heirs of promise. The Father gave them to the Son, the Son
        redeemed them, but they are in the common mass of corruption, dead in
        trespasses and sins, till the Spirit of life opens their hearts to
        receive Him, enters into them, unites them by faith to the Savior, and
        makes them the subjects of a new birth. Of the Holy Spirit it is said, 1
        Corinthians 3:16, ‘Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that
        the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?’ If it be asked how the Holy Spirit,
        who is co-essential with the Father and the Son, and consequently
        infinite, can dwell in believers, the answer is, that though everywhere
        present, He is said nevertheless to dwell in them on account of His
        operation and the grace of regeneration, which He produces. It is the
        Holy Spirit who unites them to Christ the Lord. It is He who quickens
        and regenerates them, on account of which regeneration is called he
        ‘renewing of the Holy Ghost.’ He it is who leads, rules, and governs
        them, as it is said in the 14th verse, that as many as are led by the
        Spirit of God are the sons of God. What this expression, ‘dwell in you,’
        imports is, that being united to Jesus Christ and regenerated, the Holy
        Spirit dwells in His people not as inactive, but operates in them
        continually, and leads and governs them. In the indwelling, then, of the
        Holy Spirit, is included His gracious and continuing presence, and His
        operations in the soul. The effects of these are illumination,
        sanctification, supplication, and consolation. Of the Holy Spirit, one
        of the early Christian writers says, ‘He is the author of regeneration,
        the pledge of the promised inheritance, and, as it were, the handwriting
        of eternal salvation; who makes us the temple of God and His house, who
        intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, acting as our
        advocate and defender, dwelling in our bodies, and sanctifying them for
        immortality. He it is who fights against the flesh, hence the flesh
        fights against the Spirit.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is Jesus Christ who gives to His people the Holy Spirit. ‘It is
        expedient for you,’ He says, ‘that I go away; for if I go not away, the
        Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto
        you.’ At the ancient Pentecost, God gave the law to the people of Israel
        fifty days after the institution of the Passover. Jesus Christ, as being
        the body and truth of the typical ordinances, having chosen to suffer at
        the feast of the Passover, was pleased also to send forth the Holy
        Spirit on the day of Pentecost, who by His power accomplishes in the
        hearts of believers what the law outwardly required; for the law was a
        letter written in stone, and therefore in itself without efficacy; but
        the Holy Spirit is that internal power which He puts within them and
        writes on their hearts. As, then, in the ancient Pentecost, God had
        given the law inscribed in tables of stone, so on the Christian
        Pentecost, Jesus Christ, by the power of His Spirit, writes it in their
        hearts. ‘Ye’ says the Apostle, ‘are manifestly declared to be the
        epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
        Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables
        of the heart.’ And why do we so often read in the New Testament of the
        contrast between the spirit and the letter, but to teach us that we have
        in the Christian Pentecost, by the Spirit of Christ, the truth and
        effect which the law in vain required from sinners. Now, or rather, But,
        if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His. — Here is a
        necessary reservation. If the Spirit of God did not really dwell in any
        of those whom the Apostle addressed, they were still in the flesh,
        notwithstanding all their profession, and all their present appearances,
        and his persuasion respecting them. And no doubt some will be found to
        have escaped for a time the pollutions of the world, who may afterwards
        show that they were never renewed in heart. Many ridicule the
        pretensions of those who speak of the Holy Spirit as dwelling in
        believers; yet if the Spirit of God dwell not in any, they are still in
        the flesh; that is, they are enemies to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same Spirit that is called the Spirit of God in the preceding part
        of the sentence, is in this latter part called the Spirit of Christ,
        because Christ having, by virtue of His sacrifice, obtained the Spirit
        for His people, sends Him into their hearts, John 16:7. Christ, then,
        who sends the Holy Spirit, must be God. Every Christian has the Spirit
        of Christ dwelling in him. When Christ takes possession of any man as
        His, He puts His Holy Spirit within him. Without the presence of His
        Spirit, we can have no interest in Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but
        the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle having affirmed in the 2nd verse that the law of the Spirit
        of life had made him free from the law of sin and death, and having
        declared in the 3rd and 4th verses in what manner we are freed from the
        law as the law of sin, it remained for him to show how we are freed from
        it as the law of death. This he accordingly does here, and in the
        following verse. In the 7th and 8th verses, he had confirmed his
        declaration in the 6th, that to be carnally minded is death. He now
        illustrates the opposite declaration, that to be spiritually minded is
        life. He admits, however, that notwithstanding the believer’s communion
        with Christ, the body is dead; but to this he opposes the double
        consolation of the eternal life of our souls on account of the
        righteousness of Christ, and, in the next verse, the resurrection of our
        bodies through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is in this verse a triple opposition: first, of the body to the
        soul; second, of a state of death to a state of life; third, of sin to
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was necessary to remove the objection replied to in this verse,
        especially as the Apostle had said that to those who are in Christ Jesus
        there is no condemnation. Whence, then, it might be asked, does it
        happen that we who are in Him are still subject to death like other men?
        He answers, If Jesus Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because
        of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. In what
        follows, he abundantly shows that the temporary sufferings of believers,
        among which is the death of the body, are not worthy to be compared with
        the glory that shall be revealed in them; and that in the meantime all
        things that happen to them are working for their good. The term body is,
        in this verse, to be taken, as is evident from the following verse, in
        its literal signification; and by the spirit, as opposed to it, is meant
        the soul, as in the 16th verse, where our spirit is distinguished from
        the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, or rather, But, if Christ be in you. — The Apostle had just
        affirmed that if any man have not the, Spirit of Christ, he is none of
        His; but if He be in us, then the consequences here stated follow. Jesus
        Christ, in regard to His Divine nature, is everywhere present; but He is
        in a special manner in believers, as it is said, Ephesians 3:17, ‘That
        Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.’ This indwelling of Christ
        signifies two things, namely, the close and intimate union we have with
        Him, and His operation in us. As the Scriptures declare that Jesus
        Christ is in us, so they also assure us that we are in Him, ch. <450801>
        8:1; 1 Corinthians 1:30; Corinthians 5:17; Colossians 1:27. And thus we
        dwell in Him and He in us, John 6:56. This union with Jesus Christ is
        necessary, in order that He should work in us. For He works only in His
        members; so that, for this purpose, we must be first incorporated in
        Him, John 15:4. By this union we participate in His grace; because, as
        we are in Him and He in us, we have all things with Him in common. Our
        sins are reputed His sins, and His righteousness ours. He that
        persecutes His people persecutes Him; he that touches them touches the
        apple of His eye. And as in this life they partake of His grace, so in
        the life to come they shall participate in His glory. The body is dead —
        Notwithstanding our union with Jesus Christ, our bodies are dead. The
        Scriptures speak of three kinds of death: one is in this life, the other
        at the end of this life, and the third after this life. The first is
        spiritual death, Ephesians 2:1; Colossians 2:13. Natural death takes
        place at the separation of the soul from the body; and after this life
        is the second, or eternal death, which consists in everlasting
        destruction from the presence of the Lord. It is only of the second or
        natural death that the Apostle here speaks, for believers are delivered
        from the first and the third. He says the body is dead, to show that it
        is the lowest part of man that for a time is affected by death, as it is
        said, ‘Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was,’ Ecclesiastes
        12:7. Because of sin. — Men die for the sin of Adam. ‘By one man sin
        entered into the world, and death by sin’ and God said, ‘In the day that
        thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’ But why do believers die,
        since death is the punishment of sin, and as to them God hath remitted
        this punishment? for the Apostle shows, chapter 4, that their sins are
        not imputed to them; in chapter 6, that they are dead to sin; and in the
        beginning of the chapter before us, that there is no condemnation to
        them which are in Christ Jesus. Jesus Christ, too, has made complete
        satisfaction for the punishment of their sins, sin having been condemned
        in His flesh. The Apostle also says, ‘Christ has redeemed us from the
        curse of the law, being made a curse for us;’ but death is among the
        curses of the law. We must then distinguish between death considered in
        itself, and in its nature, and as having changed its nature in Jesus
        Christ our Lord. In itself, death is the punishment of sin and the curse
        of the law, and it is such to the wicked and unbelievers. But, by the
        work of Christ, it is to His people no more a punishment of sin, but the
        destruction of sin. It is no more the curse of the law, but is changed
        into a blessing, and has become the passage to eternal life, and the
        entrance into the heavenly paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The death of believers does not, then, in the least degree derogate from
        the complete satisfaction of Jesus Christ, and the perfect redemption
        from the curse of the law, since their death is not a punishment of sin
        in vindictive justice, as all the afflictions of this life as well as
        death are to the enemies of God. But by Jesus Christ, in respect to
        those whom the Father hath given to Him, and who are united to Him, God
        acts in mercy, and afflictions and death are only chastisements from His
        fatherly hand — trials of their faith, and salutary discipline, as the
        Apostle in this chapter declares that all things work together for good;
        and in the First Epistle, to the Corinthians 3:22, that all things are
        theirs, whether life or death, God has established another covenant,
        which is that of grace, according to which those who partake in the
        death of Christ, by which that sentence was, as to them, carried into
        full execution, must indeed die; but death to them is swallowed up in
        victory; and instead of the day of their death being a day of punishment
        of sin, it is a day of triumph over death. The death of the body is as
        to them the preparation for its immortality and in corruption, as the
        seed deposited in the earth passes in such a way through death as to
        overcome it, and revives and fructifies, so that when in the earth it is
        not lost. In like manner the bodies of believers do not perish by death,
        but derive from the grave what is contrary to its natural character.
        They are sown in corruption, but they are to rise in corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are sown in weakness, but they are to rise in power. They are sown
        in dishonor, but they are to rise in glory. They are sown natural
        bodies, but they are to rise spiritual bodies. And as to the soul, death
        indeed separates it from the body, but transmits it to God. It is
        evident, then, that such a death is not a punishment of sin, or a curse
        of the law. Its end and use to the regenerate, as to their bodies, is to
        extirpate and destroy the sin that remains in them: they must die in
        order to be purified. The infusion of that moral poison has so corrupted
        our bodies, that, like the leprous house, they must be taken down and
        renewed, to be purified from sin. As the grain is not quickened except
        it die, in the same way our bodies die and molder in the dust, to be
        revived and reconstructed in holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it be said that God, without dooming His people to die, could have
        changed them in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, as He will do with
        respect to those who shall survive to the day of His coming, it should
        be considered that the wisdom of God hath judged it proper that the
        believer should be subjected to the death of the body. This tends to
        lead him to hold sin in abhorrence whence death proceeds. He also sees
        in death the goodness and the severity of God, and by it and his other
        afflictions he may judge what will be the end of those whom God punishes
        in His anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        He may observe in it the goodness of God to him in depriving it of its
        sting, and ordering it so that he may more fully taste the sweetness of
        a lasting and immortal life. Such discipline, too, tends to humble the
        believer, by which also his graces, given to him by God, are increased,
        and the power of the Lord made manifest in his weakness. Finally,
        believers die, that in their death they may be conformed to Jesus
        Christ; for it He died, shall they, who are His members, be exempt from
        this lot? and if He must in that way enter into His glory, shall they,
        who are His members, enter by any other way? And this assuredly is a
        great consolation, that in dying we follow Jesus Christ, our Head, who
        hath gone before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eye of nature, which loves its preservation, regards death with
        fear, in which it sees its destruction. The eye of the flesh, which is
        enmity against God, regards it with still greater dread, perceiving in
        it the summons to stand before the tribunal of God. But the believer, by
        the eye of faith, discovers in death what dissipates the fears of
        nature, and repels the despair of the flesh. To nature, which apprehends
        its destruction, faith opposes the weakness of death, which cannot
        prevent the resurrection; and to the condemnation which the flesh
        apprehends, opposes that life which it discovers under the mask of
        death. It sees that, though its appearance be terrific, yet in Christ it
        has lost its sting. It is like the phantom walking on the sea which
        approached to the terrified disciples, but it was Jesus Christ their
        Lord and Savior. If unknown evils that may happen in death be
        apprehended, the believer remembers that the very hairs of his head are
        all numbered. Jesus, who is with him he knows will not abandon him. He
        will not permit him to be tempted above what he is able to bear, for
        ‘precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature, then, of death, is changed to believers by Jesus Christ, so
        that ‘the day of their death is better than the day of their birth.’
        Death to them is no more a curse, but a blessing, which puts an end to
        their sins and troubles, causing them to pass to perfect holiness and
        happiness, and from being absent from the Lord to carry them into His
        presence in paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        From being strangers on the earth, it introduces them into their
        heavenly inheritance. From their wanderings and agitations here below,
        it brings them into the haven of everlasting rest. If the children of
        Israel, when they arrived at the river Jordan, were dismayed at the over
        flowings of its waters, had they not reason to rejoice when they beheld
        on the other side that fertile land which God had promised them, and
        into which they were about to enter to enjoy its fruits? But, above all,
        had they not cause of encouragement when they saw that the ark of the
        covenant was in the midst of Jordan? Death is the passage of Jordan by
        which believers enter the heavenly Canaan. In order that its waves may
        not overwhelm them in passing, Jesus Christ arrests them, since He is in
        His people, and consequently with them. This was David’s support,
        ‘Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
        evil; for Thou art with me.’ When the devouring lion roars around His
        people, ready to destroy them, Jesus Himself is still nearer to defend
        them; and He commands His angels to encamp about them, who have in
        charge to bear their spirits to the paradise of God. But the spirit is
        life. — To the fact that the body is dead, the Apostle here opposes, as
        a ground of comfort, the consideration that our souls are life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The life here spoken of is the life of God in the soul; it is the new
        and eternal life which His Spirit communicates in regeneration. The
        souls of believers are possessed of this spiritual life, of which the
        Scriptures inform us when they say that God hath ‘quickened us together
        with Christ.’ ‘Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal
        life.’ It is life, and eternal life, already possessed, and the
        commencement of that glorious life which shall be enjoyed in heaven. It
        is the blessing which the Lord commands, ‘even Life for evermore.’ This
        life, which, being borne down by so many encumbrances here, is still
        feeble, and but imperfectly enjoyed, shall, in the world to come,
        flourish in full vigor, and without any abatement. It is the life of our
        Lord and Savior, subsisting in Him, and derived from Him. In Him, His
        people shall rise and live, and live for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        He Himself hath said, ‘I am the resurrection and the life: he that
        believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever
        liveth, and believeth in Me, shall never die.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us we have a remarkable example of the accuracy with
        which the Scriptures are written. The Apostle does not say that the body
        is dead, and the spirit alive or living; or that the body is death, and
        the spirit life. Either of these would have formed the natural contrast;
        but neither would have conveyed the important sense of this passage,
        but, on the contrary, a false one. He says the body is dead, and the
        spirit is life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The body is not death, that is, in a state of everlasting death; it is
        only dead, and shall live again. On the other hand, the spirit is not
        merely said to be alive, which it might be although under sentence of
        death, afterwards to be inflicted; but it is life in the sense of that
        declaration of our Lord, ‘He that hath the Son hath life.’ The body is
        dead on account of Sin; that is, the body is not only mortal, but may,
        in some sense, be said to be already dead, being under sentence of
        death, and in constant progress towards dissolution. It remains with its
        infirmities unaltered. There is no difference between the body of the
        wicked man and the body of the believer. Every one may perceive a
        difference in their minds. The believer’s body is dead because of sin,
        according to the original sentence, ‘Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
        thou return.’ But the spirit is life — possessed of life eternal, in
        virtue of its union with Him who is ‘the life.’ Became of righteousness.
        — Here a great difficulty is removed; for it may be said, If our bodies
        are dead because of sin, how is it that our souls are life, since they
        are stained with sin, and that it is on account of their sinfulness that
        our bodies are infected with the same malady? The Apostle, in answer,
        brings into view the righteousness of Him who is in us, and shows that
        it is on account of His righteousness that our souls are life. And this
        necessarily follows; for if we have such union with our Lord and Savior,
        that we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones, that we are His
        members, and if He and we are one; His righteousness must be ours; for
        where there is one body, there is one righteousness. On the other hand,
        through the same union our sins have been transferred to Him, as is said
        by the Prophet Isaiah, ‘The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquities of us
        all.’ And the Apostle Peter says that He ‘bore our sins in His own body
        on the tree;’ He bore their punishment. ‘He was made sin for us who knew
        no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.’ An
        exchange, then, of sin and righteousness has taken place. By imputation
        He has been made sin, and by imputation we also are made righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, as being the surety of the new covenant, has appeared
        before God for us, and consequently His righteousness is ours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us we have an undeniable proof of the imputation to
        us of righteousness, for otherwise it would be a manifest contradiction
        to say that we die on account of our sins, and that we have life on
        account of our righteousness; for what is sin but the opposite of
        righteousness? Whoever, then, dies on account of the sin that is in him,
        cannot obtain life by his own righteousness. Now, if all men die on
        account of sin, as the Apostle here teaches, then no man can have life
        be his own righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead
        dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken
        your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here obviates a difficulty which might present itself from
        what he had said in the preceding verse, of the bodies of believers
        being dead though their souls have life. He now assures them that, if
        the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in them, God
        will also raise up their bodies, though at present mortal. Thus he sets
        before them, first, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and next their own
        resurrection, as being His members; for he deduces their resurrection
        from His resurrection. Their Head has conquered death and the grave, and
        with Him they shall overcome. Their freedom, then, from death he rests
        on the same foundation on which he had already shown that their freedom
        from sin was secured — on Jesus Christ, the surety of God’s gracious
        covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle elsewhere proves the resurrection of the bodies of
        believers, by comparing Jesus Christ with Adam, saying, ‘As in Adam all
        die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,’ 1 Corinthians 15:22;
        showing that if we do not rise by virtue of Jesus Christ our Lord,
        Christ would be inferior to Adam. For could the sin and death of Adam
        have more power to subject those who were in Him to death, than the
        righteousness and resurrection of Jesus Christ to deliver those who are
        in Him from death? The Apostle also declares that Jesus Christ, having
        risen from the dead, has become the first fruits of them that slept, and
        adds, ‘Every man in his own order; Christ the first fruits, afterwards
        the that are Christ’s at His corning.’ This he does for the purpose of
        showing that, as the first fruits of the ground precede the harvest, so
        the first fruits of the resurrection of Christ will be followed by that
        great harvest, in which the bodies of believers sown in the earth, after
        having died like grain cast into it, shall be revived and raised up. The
        life which has been communicated to our souls will, at the glorious
        resurrection, be also communicated to our bodies. All men will then
        arise, but not in glory, as all will not arise in virtue of the
        resurrection of our Lord. The wicked shall arise by the power of their
        Judge, to receive in their body the punishment of their sins, and to
        suffer ‘the second death;’ but believers, in virtue of the resurrection,
        and by the Spirit of Jesus Christ as their Head. For that Spirit which
        has been communicated to them from Jesus Christ, as from the head to the
        members, and who hath made their bodies His temples on earth, will raise
        them from the dust, and will perfect His work in them. Believers, then,
        may defy the grave, and glory over death, being assured of this
        resurrection. From the guilt of sin they have been delivered, it being
        ‘condemned’ in Christ — punished in His death; from the power of death
        they are released by His resurrection. On Jesus Christ, then, the sure
        foundation, is the whole of our salvation built.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Him God is well pleased; through Him the Holy Spirit is vouchsafed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ is the Alpha and the Omega; He is the ‘All in All.’ Quicken your
        mortal bodies. — From this it appears that, as to their substance, the
        bodies of believers will in their resurrection be the same as those that
        died. ‘Though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh
        shall I see God,’ Job 19:26. ‘Thy dead men shall live, together with my
        dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust:
        for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the
        dead,’ Isaiah 26:19. The soul of each man will be reunited to his own
        body in which he has done good or evil. For as the body is the organ of
        the soul in this world, so it must participate in the felicity or
        punishment that shall follow, whether the whole man has remained under
        the law, or has been received into the covenant of grace. But as to the
        qualities of the bodies of believers, these will be different from what
        they were here, as the Apostle teaches, 1 Corinthians 15:50. For as in
        this world they have borne the image of the first man, who was of the
        earth earthy; so, in the resurrection, when this corruptible shall put
        on in corruption, they shalt bear the image of the second man, who is
        heavenly; the bodies of their humiliation being fashioned like unto the
        glorious body of the Son of God, Philippians 3:21, not only in having a
        perfect beauty, exempt from all maladies, but as being spiritual,
        adapted to their spiritual and heavenly state. And as, when Jesus was
        transfigured, His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was white
        as light, so the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
        of their Father. From all this we may judge what will be the condition
        of the soul, and what its glory conformable to so glorious a body. We
        see also what is the death of believers, which is only a sleep, since it
        is to be followed by such a resurrection. Inasmuch as this mystery of
        the resurrection exceeds our reason, so is it clearly represented to us
        in Scripture. f40 By the Spirit that dwelleth in you. — The indwelling
        of the Holy Spirit, who communicates life to those who are habitations
        of God through Him, is here set before believers as a pledge that their
        bodies shall not remain under the power of death. This indwelling, which
        renders their resurrection certain, imports His love, His government,
        the operation of His grace, and His care to adorn and to beautify the
        temple in which He resides; and the end of it is to confer everlasting
        life, everlasting purity, and everlasting communion with Himself. It
        would be derogatory to the majesty and glory of the blessed Spirit to
        allow those bodies, in which He dwelt as His temple, to lie for ever in
        ruins in the dust. And God, who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead,
        that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
        covenant, will raise up the bodies of His people in virtue of that
        blood, which purchased not only the redemption of their souls, but also
        of their bodies, verse 23. The power and efficacy of the three glorious
        persons of the Godhead are thus brought into view as securing the
        complete re-establishment of the bodies of believers, which, though at
        present mortal, shall hereafter partake in all the glories and
        blessedness of eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This concurrence of the power of the Godhead in the plan of redemption,
        in which the Father provides for our salvation, the Son merits it, and
        the Holy Spirit applies it, is established in a multitude of passages of
        the Holy Scriptures. In this economy the Father occupies the place of
        the founder of the Church, the sovereign of the world, the protector and
        avenger of His laws, and the first director of the work of our
        salvation. The Son has become the Mediator between God and man, to do
        everything necessary for our redemption, while the Holy Spirit has
        assumed the office of the comforter and sanctifier of the Church. The
        first preparation for our salvation is found in what the Father has
        done, namely, in the plan which He has formed, in the election of His
        people, and His giving them to His Son; in the appointment of the
        sacrifice, in the transfer of our sins to Him who has suffered, and in
        respect to the satisfaction He has received. The second step is seen in
        what the Son has merited and effected in coming into the world, by His
        obedience, His death, and resurrection. The third discovers the Holy
        Spirit making actual application of the whole, uniting us to the Savior,
        producing in us faith and sanctification, diffusing in our hearts the
        sentiment of our peace with God in our justification, causing us to
        persevere to the end, and raising us up again, as He will do, at the
        last day. In this Divine economy the Son has received His mission from
        the Father to come into the world. On this account He so often refers
        His first advent to His being sent by the Father to take on Himself the
        office of the Prophet, the Priest, and the King of His Church. To this
        inequality of office such passages as the following ought to be
        referred: ‘— my Father is greater than I,’ John 14:28; and that in 1
        Corinthians 15:28, where it is said, ‘Then shall the Son also Himself be
        subject unto Him;’ thus terminating His mediatorial office in delivering
        up the kingdom by an act of humiliation, in the same way as He had
        entered upon it. For in neither of these texts is any personal
        inequality spoken of between the Father and Son, but an inequality of
        office according to which the Father is greater than the Son, and the
        Son inferior to the Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrection of Christ, in the passage before us, is ascribed to the
        Father and the Holy Spirit; but in other places this is also ascribed to
        the Son Himself. The Father, and the Holy Spirit, and the Son, then,
        must be one God. It is only those in whom the Spirit of God that raised
        Jesus from the dead dwells, who shall have their mortal bodies thus
        quickened, so as to rise again in glory. Christ, indeed, will also raise
        His enemies, but His own people will be made alive — which is never said
        of the wicked — to live with Him in glory for ever.
