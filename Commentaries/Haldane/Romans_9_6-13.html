      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they
        are not all Israel which are of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not as though. — That is, my grief for the state of the Jewish nation,
        and their rejection by God, does not imply that with regard to them
        anything said in the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel
        which are of Israel. — Here is the explanation of the mystery that the
        Jews, as a nation, had rejected the Messiah: they are not all true
        Israelites in the spiritual sense of the promise, who are Israelites
        after the flesh. The Jews might object, and say that if they were cast
        off and rejected, then God is unfaithful, and His promises are
        ineffectual. To this Paul answers by making a distinction among
        Israelites. Some are Israelites only in respect of their carnal descent,
        and others are children of the promise. ‘The proposition of the
        Apostle,’ says Calvin, ‘is that the promise was given in such a manner
        to Abraham and his seed, that the inheritance has no particular regard
        to every one of his descendants; and it hence follows, as a consequence,
        that the revolt of certain individuals from the Lord, who derive their
        birth from the father of the faithful, has no effect in preventing the
        stability, permanence, and steadfastness of the Divine covenant. The
        common election of the Israelitish nation does not prevent the Sovereign
        of infinite holiness from choosing for Himself, according to His secret
        counsel, whatever portion of that people He has determined to save. When
        Paul says they are not all Israel which are of Israel, and afterwards,
        neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children, he
        includes all the descendants of the father of believers under one member
        of the sentence, and points out by the other those only who are true and
        genuine sons of the friend of God, and not a degenerate race.’ Through
        the remaining part of this chapter, the Apostle shows that the rejection
        of the Messiah by the great body of the Jewish nation was neither
        contrary to the promises nor the purpose of God, but had been
        predetermined and also typified in His dealings towards individuals
        among their progenitors, as recorded in the Scriptures, and also there
        predicted. This furnishes an opportunity of more fully illustrating the
        doctrine of God’s sovereignty in choosing some to everlasting life,
        which had been spoken of in the 29th and 30th verses of the preceding
        chapter, and of His rejection of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
        children: but In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children. —
        In the preceding verse the Apostle had shown that there was a difference
        among Israelites; now he refers to a difference in the seed of Abraham.
        The error of the Jews was, that they thought they were the children of
        God by being the children of Abraham. But in this, as the Apostle
        declares, they were in error. The promise to Abraham and his seed was
        not made to him and all his descendants in general, but to him and a
        particular seed. As the children of Abraham, they were all, indeed, in
        one sense the children of God. God says to Pharaoh with respect to them,
        ‘Let my son go.’ But the natural sonship was only a figure of the
        spiritual sonship of all believers of every nation. None but such are
        the spiritual seed of Abraham, whether among Jews or Gentiles. But in
        Isaac shall thy seed be called. — Reckoned, chosen, or called into
        existence, as it is said respecting the birth of Isaac in the fourth
        chapter, ‘God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which
        be not as though they were.’ The Messiah, who was emphatically the seed
        of Abraham, says ‘The Lord hath called Me from the womb, Isaiah 49:1.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was called into existence in His human nature, and to His office of
        Mediator, in the line of Isaac. And Israel was called or chosen as God’s
        people, Isaiah 48:12. ‘Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel, My called.’
        In this sense the expression called is used in the end of the 11th
        verse. By thus appealing to the declaration of God to Abraham, that in
        Isaac his seed should be called — and reckoned more especially the seed
        of Abraham — the Apostle showed that, notwithstanding the defection of
        the great body of the nation of Israel which he so much deplored, it was
        by no means the case that the word of God had taken none effect; for
        from the beginning a distinction had been made among the descendants of
        Abraham, indicating that they are not all Israel which are of Israel.
        Only a part of that nation, which he calls a remnant, verse 27, and
        afterwards ‘a remnant according to the election of grace,’ ch. 11:5, was
        to participate in the spiritual blessings to be conveyed by promise.
        ‘When,’ says Calvin, ‘we see in the two first sons of the patriarch, the
        younger chosen by a recent promise ( Genesis 21:12; Hebrews 11:18),
        while the older was yet living, how much more might this take place in a
        long line of descendants! This prediction is taken from Genesis 17:20,
        where the Lord answers Abraham, As for Ishmael, I have heard thy
        prayers, but the blessing shall be granted to the son of Sarah, and the
        covenant established with Isaac. It hence follows as a consequence that
        certain individuals are, by a singular privilege, chosen from the elect
        people of the Jews, in whom the common adoption is ratified and rendered
        efficacious.’ It may be further remarked that when it is said, ‘In Isaac
        shall thy seed be called,’ it did not imply that all the descendants of
        Isaac were to be the spiritual seed of Abraham. Only such were to be so
        who belonged to that seed to which the word, being used in the singular,
        emphatically and exclusively applied, as the Apostle declares, Galatians
        3:16, ‘Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
        And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
        Christ.’ The meaning, then, of the declaration, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed
        be called,’ is, that as all Abraham’s posterity were not to be the
        peculiar people whom God was nationally to adopt as His children, but
        only such as should descend from Isaac, so not all the Jews are the true
        sons of God, but only such as, like Isaac, are children of the promise.
        Here it is evident, as also from Galatians 4:28, that Isaac the child of
        promise was typical of all believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are
        not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for
        the seed.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, or this explains, the declaration, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be
        called.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is intended to show that not carnal descent, but being included in
        the promise, constituted the true spiritual seed. This clearly
        establishes the difference between the sonship of Israel after the
        flesh, and the sonship of Israel after the Spirit. The nation of Israel
        stood in a relation to God in which no other nation was ever placed; but
        only a part of them enjoyed a spiritual relation. Hence the distinction
        here noted, that the children of the flesh are not the children of God,
        but the children of the promise are counted for the seed a distinction
        which the Apostle also makes, ch. 2:28, between being a Jew outwardly,
        and a Jew inwardly. These distinctions are explanatory of the
        declaration, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be called,’ and of the rejection
        of the other children, though the seed of Abraham. In the Epistle to the
        Galatians, 4:22, it is said that ‘Abraham had two sons, the one by a
        bond maid, the other by a free woman.’ This appears in the original
        history to be a merely accidental and unimportant matter; but in that
        place we are taught that it was a shadow of futurity. Ishmael, who was
        of the bond woman, it is said, was ‘born after the flesh.’ This denoted
        that though he was descended from Abraham according to the laws of
        nature, he was not a son of Abraham’s faith. Isaac was also in a certain
        sense born like Ishmael after the flesh, because he was naturally
        descended from Abraham; but not of the flesh merely, nor of the flesh
        naturally, — for according to the course of nature he never would have
        been born, — but at the same time he was more. He was not only a son of
        Abraham’s flesh, but his son as born after the Spirit, because he was
        given to Abraham, after, by the course of nature, he could not hope for
        children.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this indicated the distinction that existed in the nation of Israel,
        between those who, notwithstanding their being born in the line of
        Isaac, were the seed of Abraham merely by carnal descent, and not the
        children of God by a spiritual regeneration. Only these last were the
        children of the promise, as Isaac was, who were all one in Christ Jesus,
        and therefore in the highest sense Abraham’s seed, and ‘heirs according
        to the promise,’ Galatians 3:29 — heirs of all the spiritual blessings
        secured to Abraham by promise. ‘Paul,’ says Calvin, ‘now deduces from
        the prophecy a proposition containing his whole meaning, intent, and
        aim. For if the seed is called in Isaac, not in Ishmael, and this latter
        is no less a son of the patriarch Abraham than the former, all his
        children by lineal descent cannot be reckoned as his seed; but the
        promise is in an especial and peculiar manner fulfilled by some, but has
        not a common and equal regard to all. Children by lineal descent mean
        such as are not distinguished by a more excellent privilege than their
        being offspring by blood; children of the promise are those who are
        peculiarly marked out and sealed by their Heavenly Father.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
        Sarah shall have a son.
      </p>
      <p>
        The birth of Isaac was by promise, and without a miracle it would never
        have taken place. But the birth of Ishmael was not by promise, but in
        the ordinary course of nature. Thus the children of God specially
        promised to Abraham were those who, according to the election of God
        (who had chosen Isaac in preference to Ishmael), were to come into a
        spiritual relation with Christ, who is emphatically the promised seed in
        the line of Isaac, Galatians 3:16. To them the spiritual blessings were
        restricted, while only the temporal advantages of the national covenant
        belonged to the whole of Israel. This was intimated in God’s dealings
        with Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by
        one, even by our father Isaac; Not only in the case of Isaac was the
        election limited to him as the son of promise, but also in a still more
        remarkable instance was this truth indicated in the case of the two sons
        of Isaac. They were conceived by Rebecca of the same husband, yet God
        chose the one and rejected the other. An original difference between
        Isaac and Ishmael might be alleged, since the one was born of the lawful
        wife of Abraham, the free woman, and the other was the son of the bond
        woman; but in the case now brought forward there existed no original
        difference. Both were sons of the same father and mother, and both were
        born at the same time. The great distinction, then, made between the two
        brothers could only be traced to the sovereign will of God, who thus
        visibly notified, long before the event, the difference of the Divine
        purpose, according to election, towards the people of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — (For the children being not yet born, neither have done any
        good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand,
        not of works, but of Him that calleth;) In the case of Isaac and
        Ishmael, it might still be said, that as the latter, as soon as he came
        to years, gave evidence of a wicked disposition, this was a sufficient
        reason for preferring Isaac. But here, in a parenthesis the Apostle
        shows that the preference was given to Jacob independently of all ground
        of merit, because it was made before the children were capable of doing
        either good or evil. This was done for the very purpose of taking away
        all pretense for merit as a ground of preference. Had the preference
        been given to Jacob when he had grown up to maturity, there would have
        been no more real ground for ascribing it to anything good in him; yet
        that use would have been made of it by the perverse ingenuity of man.
        But God made the preference before the children were born. That the
        purpose of God according to election might stand — This was the very end
        and intention of the early indication of the will of God to Rebecca, the
        mother of the two children. It was hereby clearly established that, in
        choosing Jacob and rejecting Esau, God had respect to nothing but His
        own purpose. Than this what can more strongly declare His own eternal
        purpose to be the ground of all His favor to man? Not of works but of
        Him that calleth. — Expressions indicating God’s sovereignty in this
        matter are heaped upon one another, because it is a thing so offensive
        to the human mind. Yet, after all the Apostle’s precaution, the
        perverseness of men still finds ground of boasting on account of works.
        Though the children had done neither good nor evil, yet God, it is
        supposed, might foresee that Jacob would be a godly man, and Esau
        wicked. But had not God made a difference between Jacob and Esau, Jacob
        would have been no better than his brother. Were not men blinded by
        opposition to this part of the will of God, would they not perceive that
        a preference on account of foreseen good works is a preference on
        account of works, and therefore expressly contrary to the assertion of
        the Apostle — Not of works, but of Him that calleth? The whole ground of
        preference is in Him that calleth, or chooseth, not in him that is
        called. ‘Paul,’ says Calvin, ‘had hitherto merely observed, in a few
        words, the difference between the carnal sons of Abraham; namely, though
        all by circumcision were made partakers of the covenant, yet the grace
        of God was not equally efficacious in all, and the sons of the promise
        enjoy the blessings of the Most High. He now plainly refers the whole
        cause to the gratuitous election of God, which in no respects depends on
        men, so that nothing can be traced in the salvation of believers higher
        than the goodness of God; nothing in the destruction of the reprobate
        can be discovered higher than the just severity of the Sovereign of the
        world. The first proposition of the Apostle is the following: — As the
        blessing of the covenant separates the nation of the Israelites from all
        other people, so the election of God separates the men of that nation,
        while He predestinates some to salvation, others to eternal damnation.
        The second proposition is, that there is no other foundation of election
        than the mere goodness and mercy of God, which embrace whom He chooses,
        without paying the least regard to works, even after the fall of Adam.
        Third, the Lord in His gratuitous election is free and unrestrained by
        the necessity of bestowing the same grace equally on all; He passes by
        such as He wills, and chooses for His own according to His will. Paul
        briefly comprehends all these propositions in one clause, and will
        afterwards consider other points. The following words, when they were
        not yet born, neither had done any good or evil, show that God, in
        making the difference between them, could have paid no regard to their
        works, which did not yet exist. Sophists, who state that God may elect
        from among mankind by a respect to their works, since He foresees from
        their future conduct who may be worthy or deserving of grace, attack a
        principle of theology which no Christian ought to be ignorant of;
        namely, that God can regard nothing in the corrupt nature of man, such
        as that of Jacob and Esau was, by which He may be induced to do them
        kindness. When, therefore, Paul says that neither of the children had
        done any good or evil, we must add also the opinion which he had already
        formed in his mind, of their both being children of Adam, sinners by
        nature, not possessed of a single particle of righteousness. Besides,
        although the vicious and depraved nature, which is diffused through the
        whole human race, be of itself sufficient to cause damnation before it
        has shown its unholiness by any act or deed, and Esau therefore deserved
        to be rejected, because he was by nature a child of wrath, yet to
        prevent the least difficulty, as if the state of the elder was worse
        with respect to the perpetration of any offense or vice than that of the
        younger, it was necessary for the Apostle to exclude the consideration
        both of transgressions and of virtues. I confess, indeed, that it is
        true that the near cause of reprobation is our being all cursed in Adam;
        but Paul withdraws us in the meantime from this consideration, that we
        may learn to rest in the naked and simple good pleasure of God, until he
        shall have established this doctrine, that the infinite Sovereign has a
        sufficiently just cause for election and reprobation, in His own will.
        He here urges, in almost every word, the gratuitous election of God; for
        had he considered works to have any place in our election, he would have
        stated the remuneration due to their performance. But he opposes to
        works the purpose of God, which consists in the good pleasure of His
        will. And to remove all doubts and controversy concerning the subject,
        he adds, according to election, and closes in a striking manner, — not
        of works, but of Him that calleth. The opinion, therefore, that God
        elects or reprobates every one according as He foresees good or evil in
        us, is false, and contrary to the word of eternal truth.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 12. — It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</p>
      <p>
        This was a figure of the spiritual election, for in no other point of
        view is it here to the Apostle’s purpose. Not only did God choose one of
        these sons, who were equal as to their parentage, but chose that one who
        was inferior in priority of birth, the only point in which there was a
        difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        He chose the younger son, contrary to the usual custom of mankind, and
        contrary to the law of primogeniture established by God Himself
        respecting inheritances in the family of Jacob. The dominion of the
        younger, then, over the elder, flowed, as is shown in the nest verse,
        from God’s love to the one and hatred to the other; thus proving the
        election of the one and the reprobation of the other. This strikingly
        exemplified the manner of God’s dealings towards the nation of Israel,
        in discriminating between those who were the children of the flesh, and
        the others who were the children of God. How much instruction do these
        words, ‘The elder shall serve the younger,’ contain, as standing in the
        connection in which they are here placed, as well as in that part of
        Scripture from which they are quoted! They practically teach the great
        fundamental doctrines of the\parPRESCIENCE, thePROVIDENCE,
        theSOVEREIGNTY of God; His\parPREDESTINATION,ELECTION, andREPROBATION.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is written. — Here and elsewhere it is remarkable that the writers
        of the New Testament, and our Lord Himself, generally, or at least very
        often, simply say, It is written,. This is on the principle that the
        word Scripture signifies the word of God. Scripture literally signifies
        writing, and may refer to any writing; but in the appropriated sense, it
        signifies the written word of God. It is written, then, signifies, it is
        written in the word of God. When the Apostles refer in this manner to
        the Scriptures, they do it as adducing authority which is conclusive and
        not to be questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The words here quoted from Malachi expressly relate to Jacob and Esau.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Prophet likewise declares the dealing of God towards their
        posterity, but the part here referred to applies to the progenitors
        themselves. God is there reproving the people of Israel for their
        ingratitude, and manifesting His great goodness to them in loving their
        father Jacob, while He hated his brother Esau, and gave him a
        mountainous, barren country, as a sign of His hatred. Thus God preferred
        Jacob before Esau without respect to the goodness or wickedness of
        either, attaching good things to the one, and evil to the other, before
        they were born. And this quotation by the Apostle is intended to prove
        that the purpose of God, in choosing who shall be His children according
        to election, might stand, not by works, but of Him that calleth, verse
        11, which shows that all along the reference is to spiritual and eternal
        blessings, shadowed forth, as is usual in the Prophets, by things that
        are temporal and carnal. In the same place God likewise declares His
        dealings towards the posterity of Esau; but the words here quoted
        expressly refer to Jacob and Esau personally. The Apostle is speaking of
        heads of nations; and in God’s dealings towards them is found the reason
        of the difference of the treatment of their posterities. The
        introduction of Jacob and Esau personally, presents an emblem of this,
        while the design is to show that some among the Israelites were the
        children of God, and not others. That the Apostle quotes these words in
        reference to Jacob and Esau personally, is clear, since he speaks of
        them before they were born, and declares their conception by one mother,
        of one father, which could not be said of their posterity. Jacob have I
        loved, but Esau have I hated. — Jacob was loved before he was born,
        consequently before he was capable of doing good; and Esau was hated
        before he was born, consequently before he was capable of doing evil. It
        may be asked why God hated him before he sinned personally; and human
        wisdom has proved its folly, by endeavoring to soften the word hated
        into something less than hatred: but the man who submits like a little
        child to the word of God, will find no difficulty in seeing in what
        sense Esau was worthy of the hatred of God before he was born. He sinned
        in Adam, and was therefore properly an object of God’s hatred as well as
        fallen Adam. There is no other view that will ever account for this
        language and this treatment of Esau. By nature, too, he was a wicked
        creature, conceived in sin, although his faculties were not expanded, or
        his innate depravity developed, which God, who hath mercy on whom He
        will have mercy, and hardeneth whom He will, and who giveth no account
        of His matters, did not see good to counteract by His grace, as in the
        case of Jacob, who originally was equally wicked, and by nature, like
        Esau, a child of wrath and a fit object of hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not unusual to take part with Esau who was rejected, against Jacob
        who was the object of Divine favor. Everything that can be made to
        appear either amiable or virtuous in the character of Esau is eagerly
        grasped at, and exhibited in the most advantageous light. We are told of
        his disinterestedness, frankness, and generosity; while we are reminded
        that Jacob was a cool, selfish, designing man, who was always watching
        to take advantage of his brother’s simplicity, and who ungenerously and
        unjustly robbed his elder brother of the blessing and the birthright.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way of reasoning shows more zeal for the interest of a cause than
        discretion in its support. Instead of invalidating, it only serves to
        confirm the truth it opposes. While it is evident that Jacob possessed
        the fear of God, which was not the case with respect to Esau, — and
        therefore that the one was born of God, and the other remained a child
        of nature, — yet there is so much palpable imperfection and evil in
        Jacob, as to manifest that God did not choose him for the excellence of
        his foreseen works. In maintaining, then, the doctrine of the
        sovereignty of God, it is by no means necessary to vindicate the conduct
        of Jacob towards his brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both he and his mother were undoubtedly to blame, much to blame, as to
        the way in which he obtained his father’s blessing, to the prejudice of
        Esau, while the revealed purpose of God formed no apology for their
        conduct. That sin is an evil thing and a bitter, Jacob fully
        experienced. His conduct in that transaction led him into a maze of
        troubles, from which through life he was never disentangled. While Jacob
        was a man of God, and Esau a man of the world, there is enough to show
        that the inheritance was bestowed on the former not of works but of
        grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing can more clearly manifest the strong opposition of the human
        mind to the doctrine of the Divine sovereignty, than the violence which
        human ingenuity has employed to wrest the expression, Jacob have I
        loved, but Esau have I hated. By many this has been explained, ‘Esau
        have I loved less.’ But Esau was not the object of any degree of the
        Divine love, and the word hate never signifies to love less. The
        occurrence of the word in that expression, ‘hate father and mother,’
        Luke 14:26, has been alleged in vindication of this explanation; but the
        word in this last phrase is used figuratively, and in a manner that
        cannot be mistaken. Although hatred is not meant to be asserted, yet
        hatred is the thing that is literally expressed. By a strong figure of
        speech, that is called hatred which resembles it in its effects. We will
        not obey those whom we hate, if we can avoid it. Just so, if our parents
        command us to disobey Jesus Christ, we must not obey them; and this is
        called hatred, figuratively, from the resemblance of its effects. But in
        this passage, in which the expression, ‘Esau have I hatred’ occurs,
        everything is literal. The Apostle is reasoning from premises to a
        conclusion. Besides, the contrast of loving Jacob with hating Esau,
        shows that the last phrase is literal and proper hatred. If God’s love
        to Jacob was real literal love, God’s hatred to Esau must be real
        literal hatred. It might as well be said that the phrase, ‘Jacob have I
        loved,’ does not signify that God really loved Jacob, but that to love
        here signifies only to hate less, and that all that is meant by the
        expression, is that God hated Jacob less than he hated Esau. If every
        man’s own mind is a sufficient security against concluding the meaning
        to be, ‘Jacob have I hated less,’ his judgment ought to be a security
        against the equally unwarrantable meaning, ‘Esau have I loved less.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But why, it may be asked of those who object to the plain meaning of the
        words, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated, and insist that their
        import is that God loved Esau less than Jacob — why should God love Esau
        less than Jacob, and that, too, before the children were born, or had
        done good or evil? Can they explain this? Would it not involve a
        difficulty which, even on their own principles, they are unable to
        remove? Why then refuse to admit the natural and obvious signification
        of the passage? If God says that He hated Esau, are we to avoid
        receiving God’s testimony, or justified in employing a mode of torture
        in expounding His words? If, again, Esau, as some insist, were the
        better character, why was Jacob preferred to him?
      </p>
      <p>
        Others translate the word in the original by the term slighted. But if
        God had no just ground to hate Esau, He could have as little ground for
        slighting him. Why should Esau be unjustly slighted before he was born,
        more than unjustly hated? However, those who entertain a proper sense of
        man’s guilt by nature, will be at no loss to discern the ground of God’s
        hatred of Esau. Both Jacob and Esau were, like David, shapen in iniquity
        and conceived in sin, and were in themselves sinners. Esau was justly
        the object of hatred before he was born, because he was viewed in Adam
        as a sinner. Jacob was justly the object of God’s love before he was
        born, because he was viewed in Christ as righteous. That the terms love
        and hatred are here to be understood in their full and proper import, is
        evident from the question put in the 14th verse, and answered in the
        15th, 16th, and 17th verses, with the conclusion drawn in the 18th.
        ‘Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He
        hardeneth.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Compassion is a sign of love, and hardening a proof of hatred. And,
        besides this, the expression, ‘Esau have I hatred,’ is not stronger than
        what the Apostle applies to all men when he says that by nature they are
        the children of wrath, dead in trespasses and sins, and consequently
        objects of the hatred of the holy and just God. All of them are so in
        their natural state, as considered in themselves, and all of them
        continue to be so, unless delivered from that state by the
        distinguishing grace of God. To be hated on account of Adam’s sin and of
        their own corrupt nature, is common to all men with Esau who are not of
        the elect of God; and in Esau’s case this is exhibited in one instance.
        Nothing, then, is said of Esau here that might not be said of every man
        who shall finally perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are few commentators, however, who have not wavered more or less
        in their explanation of this passage. Mr. Hodge, Professor of Biblical
        Literature in the Theological Seminary at Princeton, America, gives here
        the following most erroneous interpretation: ‘It is evident that in this
        case the word hate means to love less, to regard and treat with less
        favor.’ This false gloss completely destroys the import of the passage,
        on which no one who understands the doctrine of the fall, and consequent
        condemnation of all men in Adam, ought to feel the smallest difficulty.
        In its obvious and literal meaning, what is said of Jacob and Esau must
        be true of all the individuals of the human race before they are born.
        Each one of them must either be loved or hated of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opinion held by some, that it may be questioned whether God be ever
        said to hate any man, is contrary to the revealed character of God. This
        sentiment appears to be near akin to that of the heathen philosophers,
        who held it as a maxim that God could not be angry with any one. Like
        many other unfounded dogmas, it stands in direct opposition to the whole
        tenor of the Scriptures, which represent God as angry with the wicked
        every day, and hating all workers of iniquity, Psalm 5:5. Does not the
        passage above quoted, which declares that men are by nature children of
        wrath, express this hatred of sin in the strongest manner; and
        especially of Adam’s sin, on account of which all men are children of
        wrath by nature?
      </p>
      <p>
        And does not this wrath abide on all them that believe not on the Son?
        John 3:36. ‘The Lord will take vengeance on His adversaries, and He
        reserveth wrath for His enemies,’ Nahum 1:2.
      </p>
      <p>
        In innumerable passages of Scripture, God ascribes to Himself hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men, however, are averse to this. What, then, can be done? The
        Scriptures must be explained in a forced manner; and while they say that
        God hates sinners, they are made to say that He does not hate them.
        Nothing can be more unjustifiable than this method of tampering with and
        perverting the word of God, and nothing can be more uncalled for. Hatred
        in itself is not sinful. That which is sinful ought to be hated; and
        though there is a mixture of evil in man’s hatred of evil, yet there is
        the same mixture of evil in his love of good. In God’s hatred of
        sinners, as in all His attributes, there is nothing of sinful feeling.
        We are not able to comprehend this attribute of the Divine mind; but
        every other attribute has also its difficulties. We must in this, and in
        all things, submit to God’s word, and believe it as it speaks, and not
        as we would have it to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Respecting God’s hatred of sin, and the punishment of transgressors, the
        late Dr. Thomson refers in his sermons to the following passages: —
        ’Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written
        in the book of the law to do them. The wrath of God has been revealed
        from heaven against all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men.
        Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, will be rendered to
        every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the
        Gentile. God is love; but it is also said, that God hates all workers of
        iniquity; — that the Lord revengeth, and is furious; — that His wrath
        cometh on the children of disobedience. The assertion that God is angry
        with the wicked every day, is just as level to our apprehension, as the
        assertion that God loves them that fear Him. We know that His anger is
        expressed in rebuking, chastening, punishing those who have provoked it,
        as we know that pity helps, relieves, comforts those who stand in need
        of its interposition. God is as certainly holy to hate sin, and just to
        inflict merited punishment on the sinner, as He is good and merciful,
        and compassionate to the guilty and the miserable for whom He
        interposed.’ ‘I cannot help reverting to what I formerly observed
        respecting the necessity of attributing love to God no further than His
        own word has warranted, and no further than is consistent with that
        revelation of His character which He Himself has given us. A greater
        snare cannot be laid for your piety and your judgment, than that which
        consists in making love His paramount or His only perfection. For
        whenever there is a consciousness of guilt, and a dread of
        responsibility, it must be comfortable to have a God who is divested of
        all that is frowning and indignant towards transgressors, and clothed
        with all that is compassionate and kind. And whenever there is a soft or
        a sentimental temperament at work, that representation of the Divine
        nature must be peculiarly pleasing and acceptable. And whenever men wish
        to have a religion which will be without any rigorous exactions of
        self-denial and of duty, and without any tendency to excite apprehension
        and alarm, the same predictions must exist for a supreme Ruler in whose
        benevolence all other qualities are absorbed and lost. And, accordingly,
        not only is this partial and unscriptural view of the character of God
        adopted as the leading principle of certain systems of theology, but it
        is held and cherished and acted upon by multitudes, whose sole concern
        in matters of faith is to have not what is true, but what is agreeable,
        and who find in the tenet we are speaking of, the most soothing and
        satisfying of all persuasions, — that God loves every one of His
        creatures with such an affection as is depicted in the Gospel. I warn
        you against the delusion — so dishonorable to the Holy One, the
        Everlasting Father — so ruinous to all who have surrendered themselves
        to its influence — so inconsistent with what you read in the book of
        inspiration — so destructive of that mystery of godliness and of grace
        which has been made known to us in Jesus Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Scriptures teach us that judgment has passed upon all men in Adam,
        and that it is altogether of grace that any of the human race are saved.
        Mr. Tholuck, in his exposition of this chapter, may speak most
        irreverently of God as destroying His hapless creatures, and quote the
        Apocrypha, which asserts that God does not abhor anything which He has
        made, from which it would follow that He does not abhor devils for whom
        everlasting fire is prepared; but the uniform doctrine of Scripture is,
        that man is self-destroyed, and that it was God’s eternal purpose to
        make known His manifold wisdom by the redemption of the Church, chosen
        in Christ before the foundation of the world. When the Savior was first
        announced, Genesis 3:15, mankind were divided into two classes, the one
        to be saved, the other to be lost. To the latter God did no wrong. He
        left them under condemnation, as is here exemplified in the case of
        Esau, while He plucked the former, like Jacob, as brands from the
        burning; and we are expressly told that in this case of Jacob and Esau
        the reception of the younger, and the rejection of the elder, which were
        declared previously to their birth, was in order that the purpose of God
        according to election might stand. This doctrine of the election of some
        and the rejection of others was also illustrated in Abraham, an
        idolater, and in the nation of Israel, to whom God showed His word,
        while He left all other nations to walk in their own ways. Had the whole
        of Adam’s race perished, God would only have dealt with them as He did
        with the fallen angels. Why then, it may be said, preach the Gospel to
        all men? Because it is the appointed means of the salvation of sinners;
        and while all naturally reject it, God makes His people willing in the
        day of His power, and produces in them faith by what they hear. Paul
        endured all things for the elect’s sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        He used the means, knowing that God would give the increase. The
        election thus obtain life, and the rest are blinded by the God of this
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ishmael was rejected, and Isaac was chosen before he was born; and in
        the same way Jacob the younger was preferred to Esau his elder brother —
        Jacob was loved, but Esau was hated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage in Malachi, from which these words, ‘Esau have I hated,’ are
        quoted by the Apostle, proves what is meant by the expression in the
        verse before us. ‘I have loved you, saith the Lord: yet ye say, Wherein
        hast Thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the Lord: yet I
        loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
        waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Whereas Edom saith, We are
        impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus
        saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and
        they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against
        whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.’ Here the Prophet first speaks
        of Esau personally as Jacob’s brother, which clearly indicates the
        meaning attached by the Apostle to the quotation. It implies, too, that
        Jacob had no claim to be preferred to his brother. Afterwards, in the
        denunciation, Esau’s descendants are spoken of under the name of Edom,
        when the singular is changed for the plural, and the past time for the
        future and the present.
      </p>
      <p>
        The denunciation of indignation for ever upon the Edomites, and the call
        of God to Israel to observe the difference of His dealings towards them,
        shows what is meant by God’s love of Jacob, and His hatred of Esau.
      </p>
      <p>
        The declarations of God by the Prophet in the above quoted passage are
        fully substantiated throughout the Scriptures, both in regard to His
        loving Jacob and hating Esau personally; and likewise in regard to the
        indignation which He manifested against Esau’s descendants. Jacob is
        everywhere spoken of as the servant of God, highly honored by many
        Divine communications. Jacob wrestled with God, and had power over Him,
        and prevailed, Hosea 12:4,5. With his dying breath, when he declared
        that he had waited for the salvation of the Lord, he was honored to
        announce as a prophet the future destinies of his sons, and, above all,
        to utter a most remarkable prediction concerning the advent of the
        Messiah. Jacob during his life was the object of many special blessings.
        He died in faith, Hebrews 11:13,21; and of him the Redeemer Himself has
        testified that, with Abraham and Isaac, he is now in the kingdom of
        heaven, Matthew 8:11. Concerning Jacob, such is the decisive testimony
        of the Scriptures, which cannot be broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the life of Esau, nothing is recorded indicating that he had the fear
        of God before his eyes, but everything to prove the reverse. The most
        important transaction recorded concerning him is his profane contempt
        for God’s blessing in selling his birthright, manifesting his unbelief
        and indifference respecting the promise to Abraham. We see him also
        taking women of Canaan as his wives, although he had the example before
        him of Abraham’s concern that Isaac should not marry any of the
        daughters of that country. In this we observe that he held as lightly
        the curse denounced against Canaan as he did the blessing promised to
        Abraham. We next see him deliberately resolving to murder his brother.
        ‘The days of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I slay my
        brother Jacob.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Long after, although restrained from violence, he goes out to meet him
        with an armed force. At last he turns his back on the habitation of his
        fathers, and departs for ever from the land of promise. Towards the
        conclusion of the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the sale of his
        birthright is referred to, and where Jacob is numbered among those who
        both lived and died in faith, Esau is characterized as ‘a profane
        person,’ Hebrews 12:16. The same word, translated profane, is employed
        by Paul in his enumeration to Timothy of the most horrible vices, when
        speaking of the ‘ungodly, of sinners, and of unholy persons,’ 1 Timothy
        1:9. The selling of his birthright proved Esau to be an unbelieving,
        profane, and ungodly man, and the Apostle warns believers not to act
        according to his example. The birthright conferred a double inheritance
        among the Hebrew patriarchs, and likewise pre-eminence, because it was
        connected with the descent of the Messiah; and they to whom this right
        belonged were also types of the firstborn, whose names are written in
        heaven. Despising the birthright proved that he despised the high
        distinction respecting the coming of the Messiah, and also the eternal
        inheritance of which the land of Canaan and the double portion of the
        firstborn were typical. Here the question of Esau’s character as an
        ungodly man is decided by the pen of inspiration long after his death.
        And is this ‘profane person,’ who not only despised the birthright
        fraught with such unspeakable privileges, but who had deliberately made
        up his mind revengefully to murder his brother in cold blood, to be
        viewed as he has been represented, as amiable, disinterested, and
        virtuous, in defiance of every moral principle, and in direct opposition
        to the testimony of the word of God?
      </p>
      <p>
        Such is the account which the Scriptures give of Esau personally; and
        how fully the denunciations above quoted from the Prophet respecting his
        descendants were accomplished, we learn from numerous passages
        throughout the Scriptures, as Ezekiel 25:12,14; Joel 3:19; Amos 1:11,
        and elsewhere; and from the whole of the prophecy of Obadiah, where the
        destruction of Edom, and the victories of the house of Jacob, are
        contrasted. ‘But upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall
        be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. And
        the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and
        the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour
        them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau: for the
        Lord hath spoken it.’ Is it then in the unambiguous testimony of
        Scripture respecting Esau personally, as a profane person, and
        respecting his descendants, ‘the people against whom the Lord hath
        indignation for ever,’ — is it among the many indications of God’s
        goodness to Jacob, — that we find any countenance given to the
        imagination that God loved Esau only in a less degree than He loved
        Jacob? When men, by such methods as are resorted to on this subject,
        pervert the obvious meaning of the word of God, in order to maintain
        their preconceived systems, it manifests deplorable disaffection to the
        truth of God, and most culpable inattention to His plainest
        declarations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is evident that the quotation from the Old Testament of these words,
        ‘Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated,’ is here made by the Apostle
        with the design of illustrating the great truth which he is laboring
        through the whole of this chapter to substantiate; namely, that in the
        rejection of the great body of the Jewish nation, as being ‘vessels of
        wrath,’ while He reserved for Himself a remnant among them as ‘vessels
        of mercy,’ verses 22, 23, neither the purpose nor the promises of God
        had failed. In proof of this, Paul asserts that all the seed of Abraham
        were not the children of God, and that God had plainly exhibited this
        truth in distinguishing and choosing Isaac, that in his line, in
        preference to that of Abraham’s other children, the Redeemer should
        come; and in further proof, he adduces the still stronger example of
        God’s loving Jacob and hating Esau, choosing the one and rejecting the
        other. And as the manner of God’s procedure is so contrary to the
        opinion which men naturally form of the way in which He should act, the
        Apostle immediately after affirms that in this there is no
        unrighteousness in God, and fully proves in what follows, that so far
        from being contrary to His usual mode of procedure, it is strictly in
        accordance with it, both in showing mercy on the one hand, according to
        His sovereign pleasure, and, on the other, in displaying His hatred of
        those whom He hardens. Having thus asserted that such is God’s manner of
        acting towards men, which, being established, ought to stop every mouth,
        the Apostle at once shuts the door against all impious reasonings on the
        subject, and indignantly demands of any one who should dare to
        controvert this view of the subject, — Nay but, O man, who art thou that
        repliest against God?
      </p>
      <p>
        Such persons, then, as deny that the expression, ‘Jacob have I loved,
        but Esau have I hated,’ imports literal love of the one and literal
        hatred of the other, viewing it as an isolated declaration, detached
        from its connection, and judging of it from their preconceived opinions,
        as if such a manner of acting were unworthy of God, not only disregard
        the usual legitimate rules of interpreting language, and employ a most
        unwarrantable mode of torture in expounding these words, but prove that
        they misapprehend the whole drift of the Apostle’s argument, and have no
        discernment of his purpose in introducing this example. For how would
        God’s rejection of a part of the nation of Israel as ‘vessels of wrath,’
        and His reserving a remnant among them as ‘vessels of mercy,’ be
        illustrated by His loving Esau only less than Jacob? Does the idea of
        loving less consist with the idea held forth in the expression vessels
        of WRATH?
      </p>
      <p>
        Several commentators deny that the declaration, ‘Jacob have I loved, but
        Esau have I hated,’ has any reference to their personal, spiritual, and
        eternal state. ‘It is certain,’ says Dr. Doddridge, ‘the Apostle does
        not here speak of the eternal state of Jacob and Esau, nor does he
        indeed so much speak of their persons as of their posterity, since it is
        plainly to that posterity that both the prophecies which he quotes in
        support of his argument refer.’ On this Mr. Fry remarks, ‘If so, the
        force and pertinency of the Apostle’s reasonings are lost. In attending,
        however, to the Apostle’s argument in the passage before us, it will
        appear plain to every inquirer, who is not biased by the apprehension of
        certain Consequences, supposed to result from this interpretation, that
        St. Paul does certainly consider Jacob and Esau to be personally
        referred to, and concerned in these prophecies which he quotes; and that
        with them personally, and not altogether with their respective seeds,
        has his argument to do. The Apostle is showing that the rejection of the
        natural descendants of the patriarchs does not argue a breach of that
        word of God, which promises eternal mercies to Abraham and his seed,
        because by that seed was not intended all the seed born to Abraham after
        the flesh, but a seed of true believers, of whom Abraham, in the view of
        God, was the constituted father. In confirmation of this, he refers to
        the case of Ishmael, who was rejected, and of all the other children of
        Abraham being passed over in silence, Isaac remaining the only seed to
        inherit and to entail the promise. Again, as a still more striking proof
        that the word of promise discriminated a particular seed, and addressed
        not the children of the flesh universally, the Apostle instances the
        cases of Jacob and Esau. The first of these is chosen of God, and
        invested with the promised blessing; the other is rejected, and that in
        circumstances, as he points out to us, which plainly show that of the
        descendants of the patriarchs, God, according to His will and pleasure,
        would make some, and not others, to be counted to Abraham for a “seed”
        in a spiritual sense, to be of the children of God. It is evident,
        therefore, that the Apostle means to assert that Jacob was counted for
        one of “the” spiritual “seed,” was “a child of God,” and that Esau,
        though one of “the children” of Abraham “according to the flesh,” was
        “not a child of God,” nor “counted for the seed;” and, moreover, that it
        was the election of God, and no merit or demerit of the parties, which
        made this difference between them. It follows that whatever these
        prophecies may refer to besides, if we admit that the Apostle understood
        them, they do refer most certainly to Jacob and Esau personally; nay
        more, are quoted by the Apostle with this reference alone. For though in
        these prophecies, as they stand in the Scriptures of the Old Testament,
        a doom was certainly pronounced, which affected very materially the
        posterity of Jacob and Esau, and the children of the former were elected
        to privileges, from the inheritance of which the children of the latter
        were excluded, yet the Apostle does not quote the prophecies in this
        sense. That were in fact to overturn his own argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because, if what was prognosticated of the respective posterities of the
        persons mentioned in the prophecies were the object in view, it would
        prove that the children of the flesh, as far, at least, as the children
        of Israel were concerned, were counted for the seed. But the Apostle’s
        argument goes to prove that the reverse is the case, — that they are not
        all Israel who are of Israel. With respect to the natural privileges and
        the pre-eminence which was given to Jacob and denied to Esau, as the
        representatives of their respective seeds, it would not stand true that
        they were not all Israel who were of Israel. The privileges in question
        had been enjoyed by the children of the flesh, and have just been
        enumerated as possessed by those very Israelites whose rejection from
        being the children of God the Apostle is now deploring, while, at the
        same time, he proves that rejection not contrary to the promises made to
        the fathers. We may therefore safely conclude that the Apostle does not
        so much speak of the posterity, as of the persons of Jacob and Esau; and
        that he knew the prophecies he quotes in support of his argument not to
        refer alone to that posterity; and consequently that it is certain he
        does speak of the eternal state of Jacob and Esau.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole of the context throughout this ninth chapter, as well as the
        concluding part of the eighth, proves that respecting Jacob and Esau the
        reference is to their spiritual and eternal state. At the 29th verse of
        the preceding chapter, the Apostle, after exhibiting to believers
        various topics of the richest consolation, had traced up all their high
        privileges to the eternal purpose of God, and had dwelt in the sequel on
        their perfect security as His elect. In the beginning of this chapter,
        he had turned his eye, with deep lamentation, to the very different
        state of his countrymen, who, notwithstanding all their distinguished
        advantages, had rejected the Messiah. This gave occasion for enlarging
        on the sovereignty of God in the opposite aspect to that in which he had
        treated it in respect to believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reference to believers, he had spoken of God’s sovereignty as
        displaying itself in their election, and now, in reference to the great
        body Of the Jews, as manifested in their rejection. By this arrangement,
        an opportunity was afforded most strikingly to exhibit that doctrine, by
        personal application in both cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is evident that Paul, throughout this chapter, refers not to the
        external condition of the Jews, which was indeed involved in their
        rejection of Christ, but to their spiritual state, as rejecting the
        righteousness which is of faith, and stumbling at that stumbling stone,
        verse 32. He observes that not only at that time, but in former ages,
        according to the testimony of their own Prophets, a remnant only should
        be saved. And, besides, while the whole tenor of his discourse makes it
        obvious that he is treating of their spiritual and eternal condition,
        this is conclusively evident from what he says in the 22nd and 23rd
        verses above referred to, where he speaks, on the one hand, of the
        vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction, and, on the other, of the
        vessels of mercy, prepared unto glory. These two verses, were there no
        other proof, evince beyond all doubt what is his object. His lamentation
        for his countrymen was not called forth on account of the loss of their
        external privileges, the destruction of Jerusalem, and their expulsion
        from their own land. Had it been so, he must have included himself, and
        also those Jews whom, in the 24th verse, he says God had called. But so
        far is he from representing these to be in a lamentable state, that he
        describes them, along with himself, as vessels on whom the riches of the
        glory of God was made known; while, by the contrast, it is evident that
        by the wrath and destruction of which the others were vessels, he means
        something very different from temporal calamities. The vessels of the
        one description were the ‘remnant’ which should be saved, the ‘seed’
        which the Lord of Sabbath had left, verses 27, 29. The vessels of the
        other description were these who were as ‘Sodom, and had been made like
        unto Gomorrah,’ which suffered the vengeance of eternal fire. What
        trifling, then, what wresting of this important portion of the word of
        God, what turning of it entirely away from its true meaning, to
        represent this chapter, as so many do, as treating of the outward state
        of the Jews, or to deny, with others, that the spiritual and everlasting
        condition of Jacob and Esau are here referred to! If the eternal
        condition of Abraham and of Judas be determined in the Scriptures, so
        also is that of Jacob and Esau; and no meaning, which, from whatever
        motive, any man may affix to the whole tenor of Scripture respecting
        them, will alter their condition. It is better to submit to the word of
        God on this and every other subject, taking it in its obvious import,
        than to be deterred from doing so on account of consequences from the
        admission of which we may shrink back. All Scripture will thus be
        profitable to us for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
        instruction in righteousness, while we are sure that the Judge of all
        the earth will do right.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the whole, we see with what propriety the Apostle here introduces the
        different states of Jacob and Esau, the one beloved of God, the other
        hated. Besides elucidating the subject in question respecting God’s
        dealings with the nation of Israel, and of the word which He had spoken
        taking effect, they illustrate by particular examples both sides of the
        important doctrine of God’s sovereignty in the election, and of His
        justice in the reprobation of fallen men. For, by acting in this manner,
        God has clearly shown that He is the Sovereign Master in their calling
        and election, and of their rejection — that He chooses and rejects as
        seems good to Him any of the sinful race of Adam, all of whom are justly
        objects of His displeasure, without regarding natural qualities which
        distinguish them from one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is said of Jacob and Esau in the Old Testament, in the place to
        which Paul refers, is both historical and typical. It relates, in the
        first view, to themselves personally, the elder being made subservient
        to the younger by selling his birthright. In consequence of that act,
        the declaration, The elder shall serve the younger, was verified from
        the time when it took place. All the rights of the firstborn were thus
        transferred to Jacob, and the inheritance of Canaan devolved on him by
        the surrender of his ungodly brother. At length Esau was compelled to
        leave that land, and to yield to Jacob. When the riches of both of them
        were more than that they might dwell together,’ ‘Esau,’ it is said,
        ‘took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of
        his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance
        which he had got in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from
        the face of his brother Jacob, Genesis 36:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever, therefore, might have previously been the opposition of their
        interests, in this the most important act of his life relating to Jacob,
        Esau was finally made subservient to his younger brother. And this
        subserviency, in yielding up the inheritance which naturally belonged to
        him, continued during the remainder of their lives; so that the
        declaration, ‘The elder shall serve the younger,’ was, after various
        struggles between them, personally and literally fulfilled. In the
        second view, as being typical, what is said of them relates, on the one
        hand, to the state of Israel after the flesh, trampling on and
        forfeiting their high privileges, hated of God, and vessels of wrath
        fitted to destruction; and, on the other hand, to the vessels of mercy
        which God had afore prepared unto glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In loving Jacob, God showed him unmerited favor, and acted towards him
        in mercy; and in hating Esau, He showed him no favor who was entitled to
        none, and acted according to justice. Had God acted also in justice
        without mercy towards Jacob, He would have hated both; for both were in
        their origin guilty in Adam, wicked and deserving of hatred. The Apostle
        unveils the reason why this was not the case, when he afterwards says
        that God has mercy on whom He will have mercy. The justice of God in
        hating Esau was made fully manifest in the sequel by his abuse of the
        high privileges in the course of providence bestowed upon him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding all the advantages of instruction and example with
        which, beyond all others of the human race (with the exception of the
        rest of his family), he was distinguished, Esau despised his birthright,
        fraught with so many blessings, the natural right to which had been
        conferred on him in preference to his brother Jacob, and lived an
        ungodly life. If Jacob, who was placed in the same situation proved
        himself to be a godly man, it was entirely owing to the distinguishing
        grace of God. If it be objected, why was not this grace also vouchsafed
        to Esau? it may as well be asked, why are not the whole of mankind
        saved? That this will not be the case, even they who oppose the
        sovereignty of God in the election of grace cannot deny. Besides, will
        they, who affirm that God chooses men to eternal life because He
        foresees that they will do good works, deny that, at least, God foresaw
        the wickedness of Esau’s life? Even on their own principles, then, it
        was just to hate Esau before he was born; and, on the same ground of
        foreseeing his good works, it would have been just to love Jacob. Or
        will they say that this hatred should not have taken place till after
        Esau had acted such a part? This would prove that there is variableness
        with God, and that He does not hate to-day what He will hate to-morrow.
        Where, then, is the necessity for any one, whatever may be his
        sentiments, to resort to the vain attempt to show that, when it is said
        God loved Jacob and hated Esau, it only means that He loved Esau less
        than Jacob? As well may it be affirmed that, when, in the prophecy of
        Amos 5:15, it is said, ‘Hate the evil, and love the good,’ the meaning
        is, that we ought to love evil only in a less degree than good. But the
        truth is, that all opposition to the plain and obvious meaning of this
        passage proceeds from ignorance of, or inattention to, the state of
        death and ruin in which all men by nature lie, and from which no man can
        be recovered by any outward means alone, however powerful in themselves.
        This cannot be effected by anything short of the unmerited and
        invincibly efficacious grace of God, operating in the heart of those on
        whom He will have mercy according to His sovereign good pleasure.
        Undoubtedly God was under no more obligation to save any of the human
        race than He was to save the fallen angels. If He save any man, it is
        because He hath mercy on whom He will have mercy, or as seemeth good to
        Him. According to those who oppose this manner of acting, God was under
        an obligation to send His Son into the world to save sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the 7th to the end of this 13th verse, we have an incontestable
        proof of the typical nature of the historical facts of the Old
        Testament, by which God was pleased to exhibit a picture or
        representation of spiritual things, and of His dealings respecting the
        people of Israel, as well as what related to His Church in the future
        economy. This typical import is fully recognized in various places in
        the New Testament, showing, as the Apostle declares in the 15th chapter
        of this Epistle, that ‘whatsoever things were written aforetime, were
        written for our learning,’ and also when he speaks of what took place
        respecting Israel in their journey from Egypt, which is equally
        applicable to so many other events. ‘Now all these things happened to
        them for examples,’ literally, types, 1 Corinthians 10:6-11. This proves
        that these occurrences were expressly ordained by Divine wisdom to be ‘a
        shadow of things to come.’ All this, too, we may collect from those
        types and figures of the Old Testament, which would have been wholly
        inconclusive, unless, by a particular destination of the providence of
        God, they had been really instituted to prefigure future events. By many
        it is indeed affirmed that such historical facts as the Apostle in these
        verses refers to, are only accommodated to the allegorical meaning. This
        unfounded allegation, so derogatory to the Holy Scriptures, and utterly
        repugnant to their character as a revelation from God, I have exposed in
        various parts of this work. I have adverted to it more fully, because,
        as formerly observed, it brings a palpable charge of falsehood and
        dishonesty against the inspired writers, representing them as quoting
        the language of the Holy Spirit in a meaning which He did not intend to
        convey, and as confirmatory of their own doctrine, when they knew that
        what they advanced was merely a fanciful accommodation of words.
        Although this degrading opinion is so much countenanced by such writers
        as Tholuck and Stuart, and by many others, I am not aware that it has
        hitherto attracted all that attention, and been marked with that
        abhorrence, which it so justly merits. Nothing is more clear than that
        such historical facts and occurrences as those to which Paul in the
        foregoing passages appeals, were divinely ordered and adapted to
        represent spiritual things; and it is of great importance in the present
        day, when interpreters are so much inclined to overlook the types of the
        Old Testament, to take every proper opportunity of placing them in their
        true lights and pointing out the important purpose which they were
        intended to serve in the future economy, and for which they are referred
        to as in the passages before us. f47
