      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 1:1-15</p>
      <p>
        THIS chapter consists of three parts. In the first fifteen verses, which
        form a general preface to the whole Epistle, Paul, after announcing his
        office and commission, declares the majesty and power of Him by whom he
        was appointed, who is at once the Author and Subject of the Gospel. He
        then characterizes those to whom he writes, and states his longing
        desire to visit them, for the purpose of confirming their faith. The
        second part of the chapter, comprising only the 16th and 17th verses,
        embraces the substance of the grand truths which were about to be
        discussed. In the remainder of the chapter, the Apostle, at once
        entering on the doctrine thus briefly but strikingly asserted, shows
        that the Gentiles were immersed in corruption and guilt and consequently
        subjected to condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
        separated unto the gospel of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conformably to the practice of antiquity, Paul commences his Epistle by
        prefixing his name, title, and designation. He had, as was usual among
        his countrymen, two names: by the first, as a Jew, he was known in his
        own land; by the second, among the Gentiles. Formerly his name wasSAUL,
        but after the occurrence related of him, Acts 13:9, he was calledPAUL.
        Paul was of unmingled Jewish descent, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, born at
        Tarsus in Cilicia, but educated at Jerusalem; a Pharisee by profession,
        and distinguished among the disciples of Gamaliel, one of the most
        celebrated teachers of his age and nation. Before his conversion, he was
        an ardent and bigoted supporter of the traditions of his fathers,
        violently opposed to the humbling doctrines of Christianity, and a cruel
        persecutor of the Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the period of his miraculous conversion — from the hour when Jesus
        met him on the road to Damascus — down to the moment when he sealed his
        testimony with his blood, his eventful life was devoted to the
        promulgation of the faith which once he destroyed. Throughout the whole
        of his long and arduous course, he experienced a continual alternation
        of trials and graces, of afflictions and benedictions; always borne down
        by the hand of man, always sustained by the hand of God. The multiplied
        persecutions he endured, furnish a remarkable example of that just
        retribution which even believers seldom fail to experience in this
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        When scourged in the synagogues of the Jews — when persecuted from city
        to city, or suffering from cold and hunger in the dungeons of Nero —
        with what feelings must he have remembered the time when, ‘breathing out
        threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord,’ he
        ‘banished them oft in every synagogue,’ and, ‘being exceedingly mad
        against them, persecuted them even unto strange cities;’ or, when he was
        stoned at Lystra, and cast out of the city as dead, how must he have
        reflected on the prominent part he bore in the stoning of Stephen? A
        servant of Jesus — Paul, who once verily thought that he ought to do
        many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, now subscribes
        himself His servant — literally, slave. This is an expression both of
        humility and of dignity — of humility, to signify that he was not his
        own, but belonged to Jesus Christ; of dignity, to show that he was
        accounted worthy to be His minister, as Moses and Joshua are called the
        servants of God. It the first sense, it is an appellation common to
        believers, all of whom are the slaves, or exclusive property of Jesus
        Christ, who has purchased them for Himself by the right of redemption,
        and retains them by the power of His word and Holy Spirit. In the second
        view, it denotes that Jesus Christ had honored Paul by employing him in
        His Church, and making use of his services in extending the interests of
        His kingdom. He assumes this title to distinguish himself from the
        ministers or servants of men, and in order to command respect for his
        instructions, since he writes in the name and by the authority of Jesus
        Christ. Called to be an Apostle, or a called Apostle. — Paul adds this
        second title to explain more particularly the first, and to show the
        rank to which he had been raised, and the employment with which he was
        entrusted. He was called to it by Jesus Christ Himself; for no man could
        bestow the office of an Apostle, or receive it from the hand of man,
        like the other offices in the church. Called, too, not merely externally
        as Judas, but internally and efficaciously; and called with a vocation
        which conferred on him all the qualities necessary to discharge the
        duties of the office he was appointed to; for the Divine calling is in
        this respect different from that which is merely human, inasmuch as the
        latter supposes those qualities to exist in the person called, while the
        former actually confers them. The state of Paul before his calling, and
        that in which his calling placed him, were directly opposite to each
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The office to which Paul was called was that of an Apostle, which
        signifies one that is sent by another. The word in the original is
        sometimes translated messenger, but is specially appropriated in
        Scripture to those who were sent forth by Jesus Christ to preach His
        Gospel to the ends of the earth; and this appellation was given to the
        twelve by Himself, Luke 6:13, and has, as to them, a more specific
        signification than that of being sent, or being messengers. This office
        was the highest in the church, distinct from all others, in which, both
        from its nature and authority, the manner of its appointment, and the
        qualifications necessary for its discharge, those on whom it was
        conferred could have no successors. The whole system of the man of sin
        is built on the false assumption that he occupies the place of one of
        the Apostles. On this ground he usurps a claim to infallibility, as well
        as the power of working miracles, and in so far he is more consistent
        than others who, classing themselves with those first ministers of the
        word, advance no such pretensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Apostles were appointed to be the witnesses of the Lord, it was
        indispensably necessary that they should have seen Him after His
        resurrection. The keys of the kingdom of heaven were committed to them
        exclusively. They were to promulgate its laws, which bind in heaven and
        on earth, proclaiming that word by which all men shall be judged at the
        last day. When Jesus Christ said to them, ‘As My Father hath sent Me,
        even so send I you,’ He pledged Himself for the truth of their doctrine;
        just as when the voice from the excellent glory proclaimed, ‘This is My
        beloved Son, hear Him,’ the Father set His seal to whatever His Son
        taught. In preaching the Divine word, though not in their personal
        conduct, the Apostles were fully inspired; and the Holy Scriptures, as
        indicted or sanctioned by them, are not the words of man, but the words
        of the Holy Ghost. The most awful anathema is accordingly annexed to the
        prohibition either to add to or take from the sacred record. Thus the
        Lord, who had appointed the Apostles not to a ministry limited or
        attached to a particular flock, but to one which extended generally
        through all places, to preach the Gospel in all the world, and to
        regulate the churches, endowed them with an infallible Spirit which led
        them into all truth. They were also invested with the gift of working
        miracles on every necessary occasion, and of exclusively communicating
        that gift to others by the laying on of their hands. From all this it
        followed that they were perfectly qualified to preach the everlasting
        Gospel, and possessed full authority in the churches to deliver to them
        those immutable and permanent laws to which thenceforth to the end of
        time they were to be subject. The names of the twelve Apostles of the
        Lamb are accordingly inscribed in the twelve foundations of the wall of
        the New Jerusalem; and all His people are built upon the foundation of
        the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
        cornerstone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every qualification of an Apostle centered in Paul, as he shows in
        various places. He had seen the Lord after His resurrection, 1
        Corinthians 9:1.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had received his commission directly from Jesus Christ and God the
        Father, Galatians 1:1. He possessed the signs of an Apostle, Corinthians
        12:12. He had received the knowledge of the Gospel, not through any man,
        or by any external means, but by the, revelation of Jesus Christ,
        Galatians 1:11,12; and although he was as one born out of due time, yet,
        by the grace vouchsafed to him, he labored more abundantly than all the
        rest. When he here designates himself a called Apostle, he seems to
        refer to the insinuations of his enemies, who, from his not having been
        appointed during the ministry of our Lord, considered him as inferior to
        the other Apostles. The object of nearly the whole of the Second Epistle
        to the Corinthians is to establish his apostolic authority; in the third
        chapter especially, he exhibits the superiority of the ministration
        committed to the Apostles, over that entrusted to Moses. Thus the
        designation of servant, the first of the titles here assumed, denotes
        his general character; the second, of Apostle, his particular office;
        and the term Apostle being placed at the beginning of this Epistle,
        impresses the stamp of Divine authority on all that it contains.
        Separated unto the Gospel of God — This may regard either God’s eternal
        purpose concerning Paul, or His pre-ordination of him to be a preacher
        of the Gospel, to which he was separated from his mother’s womb, as it
        was said to Jeremiah 1:5, ‘Before I formed thee in the belly I knew
        thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified these
        and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations;’ or rather it refers to
        the time when God revealed His Son in him, that he might preach Him
        along the heathen, Galatians 1:16. The term separated, here used,
        appears to allude to his having been a Pharisee before his conversion,
        which signifies one separated or set apart. Now, however, he was
        separated in a far different manner; for then it was by human pride, now
        it was by Divine grace. Formerly he was set apart to uphold the
        inventions and traditions of men, but now to preach the Gospel of God.
        The Gospel of God to which Paul was separated, signifies the glad
        tidings of salvation which God has proclaimed. It is the supernatural
        revelation which He has given, distinguished from the revelation of the
        works of nature. It denotes that revelation of mercy and salvation,
        which excels in glory, as distinguished from the law, which was the
        revelation of condemnation. It is the Gospel of God, inasmuch as God is
        its author, its interpreter, its subject: its author, as He has purposed
        it in His eternal decrees; its interpreter, as He Himself hath —
        declared it to men; its subject, because in the Gospel His sovereign
        perfections and purposes towards men are manifested. For the same
        reasons it is also called the Gospel of the grace of God, the Gospel of
        peace, the Gospel of the kingdom, the Gospel of salvation, the
        everlasting Gospel, the glorious Gospel of the blessed God. This Gospel
        is the glad tidings from God of the accomplishment of the promise of
        salvation that had been made to Adam. That promise had been typically
        represented by the institution of sacrifice, and transmitted by oral
        tradition. It had been solemnly proclaimed by Enoch and by Noah before
        the flood; it had been more particularly announced to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob; by Moses, it was exhibited in those typical
        representations contained in the law, which had a shadow of good things
        to come. Its fulfillment was the spirit and object of the whole
        prophetic testimony, in the predictions concerning a new covenant, and
        in all that was foretold respecting the advent of the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2.— Which He had promised afore by His prophets in the Holy
        Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
        By declaring that the Gospel had been before promised, Paul tacitly
        repels the accusation that it was a novel doctrine. At the same time, he
        states its Divine origin as a reason why nothing new is to be admitted
        in religion. He further shows in what respect the Old and New Testaments
        differ — not as containing two religions essentially dissimilar, but as
        exhibiting the same grand truth — predicted, prefigured, and fulfilled.
        The Old Testament is the promise of the New, and the New the
        accomplishment of the Old. The Gospel had been promised by all the
        prophecies which foretold a new covenant, — by those which predicted the
        coming of the Messiah, — by all the observances, under the law, that
        contained in themselves the promise of the things they prefigured, — by
        the whole of the legal economy, that preceded the Gospel, in which was
        displayed the strictness of Divine justice, which in itself would have
        been a ministration only of condemnation, had it not been accompanied by
        all the revelations of grace and mercy, which were in substance and
        embryo the Gospel itself, and consequently foretold and prepared the way
        for a more perfect development. By His Prophets. — Paul here also repels
        another accusation of the Jews, namely, that the Apostles were opposed
        to Moses and the Prophets; and intimates their complete agreement. He
        thus endeavors to secure attention and submission to his doctrine, by
        removing the prejudices entertained against it, and by showing that none
        could reject it without rejecting the Prophets. In addition to this, he
        establishes the authority of the Prophets by intimating that it was God
        Himself who spoke by them, and consequently that their words must be
        received as a revelation from heaven. In the Holy Scriptures. — Here he
        establishes the inspiration of the Scriptures, by pronouncing them holy,
        and asserting that it was God Himself who spoke in them; and shows
        whence we are now to take the true word of God and of His Prophets, —
        not from oral tradition, which must be uncertain and fluctuating, but
        from the written word, which is certain and permanent. He teaches that
        we ought always to resort to the Scriptures; for that, in religion,
        whatever they do not contain is really novel, although it may have
        passed current for ages; while all that is found there is really
        ancient, although it may have been lost sight of for a long period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — Concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which has made of
        the seed of David according to the flesh f2.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel of God concerns His Son. The whole of it is comprised in the
        knowledge of Jesus Christ; so that whoever departs one step from Him,
        departs from the Gospel. For as Jesus Christ is the Divine image of the
        Father, He is set before us as the real object of our faith. It is of
        Him that the Gospel of God, promised by the Prophets, treats; so that He
        is not simply a legislator or interpreter of the Divine will, like
        Moses, and the Prophets, and the Apostles. Had the law and the Gospel
        been given by others than Moses and the Apostles, the essential
        characteristics of these two economies would have remained the same. But
        it is altogether different respecting Jesus Christ, who is exclusively
        the Alpha and Omega of the Gospel, its proper object, its beginning and
        its end. For it is He who founded it in His blood, and who has
        communicated to it all its virtue. On this account He Himself says, ‘I
        am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father
        but by Me.’ He is the Son of God, His own Son, the Only-begotten of the
        Father; which proves that He is truly and exclusively His Son, of the
        same nature, and equal with the Father, and not figuratively, or in a
        secondary sense, as angels or men, as Israel or believers. Jesus Christ.
        — He was called Jesus, the Greek name of the Hebrew Joshua, signifying
        Jehovah that saveth; and so called by the angel before He was born.
        ‘Thou shalt call His nameJESUS; for He shall save His people from their
        sins,’ Matthew 1:21. The title Christ — that is, Messiah, or ‘Anointed’,
        — being so often added in designation of His office, at length came into
        use as a part of His name. Our Lord. — This follows from His being the
        Son of God. The word translated Lord, comprehends the different names or
        titles which the Hebrews gave to God, but most usually corresponds with
        that of Jehovah. Where it is used as the name of God, it designates
        essentially the three persons of the Godhead; but it is also applied to
        any one of the Divine persons. In the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles,
        it generally refers to Christ; and in these Divine writings this
        appellation is applied to Him in innumerable instances. He is called
        ‘the Lord of glory;’ ‘the Lord both of the dead and living;’ ‘the Lord
        of all.’ The name Jesus refers to His saving His people; the designation
        Christ , to His being anointed for that purpose; and that of Lord, to
        His sovereign authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        On whatever subject Paul treats, he constantly introduces the mystery of
        Christ. In writing to the Corinthians, he says, ‘I determined not to
        know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.’ This is a
        declaration that the doctrine concerning Christ is the whole of
        religion; in which all besides is comprehended. In delivering his
        instructions to the saints at Corinth respecting the incestuous person
        he points out to them Jesus Christ as the Lamb that was sacrificed. If
        his subject respects the promises he has made, or the engagements he has
        entered into, he draws our attention to the promises of God, which are
        all yea and amen in Christ Jesus. When he treats of the precepts to be
        obeyed, he regards them as connected with the knowledge of Christ. All
        duties are considered in relation to Him, as the only Savior from whom
        we can derive power to fulfill them, the only altar on which they can be
        accepted, that model according to which they are to be performed, and
        the motive by which those who perform them are to be actuated. He is the
        head that gives life to the members, the root which renders the branches
        fruitful. Believers are the workmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus
        unto good works. Jesus Christ is the end and object of their obedience,
        in order that the name of the Father may be glorified in the Son, and
        that the name of the Son may be glorified in them. Accordingly, the
        Scriptures speak of the commencement and the continuation of the life of
        believers as being derived from Christ; of their being planted together
        with Him; buried and risen with Him; walking in Him; living and dying
        with Him. The principal motives to holiness, in general, or to any
        particular duty, are drawn from some special view of the work of
        redemption, fitted to excite to the fulfillment of such obligations. The
        love of God in Christ is set before us, in a multitude of passages, as
        the most powerful motive we can have to love Him with all our heart,
        with all our soul, and with all our mind. When we are exhorted to look
        not to our own things only, but also to those of others, it is because
        we ought to have the same mind in us that was in Christ Jesus, who,
        being in the form of God, humbled Himself to do such wonderful things
        for us. The duty of almsgiving is enforced by the consideration that He
        who was rich for our sakes became poor, that we through His poverty
        might be rich. Forbearance to weak brethren has for its motive the death
        of Christ for them. If we are exhorted to forgive the offenses of
        others, it is because God, for Christ’s sake, hath forgiven us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reciprocal duties of husband and wife are enforced by the
        consideration of the love of Christ, and the relation in which He stands
        to His Church. The motive to chastity is, that we are members of
        Christ’s body, and temples of the Holy Ghost. In one word, the various
        exhortations to the particular duties of a holy life, and the motives
        which correspond to each of them, are all taken from different views of
        one grand and important object, the mystery of redemption. He ‘His own
        self bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, being dead to
        sins, should live unto righteousness.’ ‘Ye are bought with a price;
        therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are
        God’s.’ Having referred to Jesus Christ under the title of the Son of
        God, the Apostle immediately subjoins a declaration concerning His
        person as God and man. Which was made of the seed of David. — The wisdom
        of God was displayed in the whole of the dispensation that related to
        the Messiah, who, in His human nature, was, conformably to many express
        predictions, to descend from David king of Israel f4 . He was born of a
        virgin of the family of David; and the first promise, containing His
        earliest name, the seed of the woman, indicated that He was in this
        supernatural manner to come into the world; as also that He was to be
        equally related to Jews and to Gentiles. To Abraham it was afterwards
        promised, that the Messiah should spring from him. ‘In thy seed shall
        all the nations of the earth be blessed.’ But as this promise was still
        very general, it was next limited to the tribe of Judah. ‘The scepter
        shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until
        Shiloh come.’ And to David the Lord had sworn, ‘Of the fruit of thy body
        will I set upon thy throne.’ Thus, as the period of His birth
        approached, the promises concerning Him were more particular and more
        restricted. The wisdom of God was pleased in this manner to designate
        the family in which the Messiah, as to His human nature, was to be born,
        that it might be one of the characteristics which should distinguish and
        make Him known, as well as to confound the unbelief of those who should
        reject Him, and deny His advent. For, if He has not yet come, it was to
        no purpose that the prophets foretold that He should descend from a
        certain family, since all the genealogies of the Jews are now lost. It
        must therefore be admitted either that these predictions, thus
        restricted, were given in vain, or that the Messiah must have appeared
        while the distinction of Jewish families still subsisted, and the royal
        house of David could still be recognized. This declaration of the
        Apostle was calculated to have great weight with all, both Jews and
        Gentiles, who reverenced the Old Testament Scriptures, in convincing
        them that Jesus Christ was indeed the Messiah, the hope of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        God has also seen it good to exhibit, in the birth of Jesus Christ, that
        union of majesty and dignity on the one hand, and weakness and abasement
        on the other, which reigns through the whole of His economy on earth.
        For what family had there been in the world more glorious than that of
        David, the great king of Israel, most honored and beloved of God, both
        as a prophet and a king? And what family was more reduced or obscure
        when Jesus Christ was born? This is the reason why He is represented by
        the prophet Isaiah as the rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch
        growing out of his roots, which marks a family reduced, as if nothing
        more remained but the roots, which scarcely appeared above ground. And
        by the same prophet it is also said, ‘He shall grow up before him as a
        tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground.’ According to the
        flesh. — The prophets had abundantly testified that the Messiah was to
        be truly man, as well as truly God, which was necessary in order to
        accomplish the purpose of His advent. ‘Forasmuch then as the children
        are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of
        the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of
        death.’ The Apostle John declares that Jesus Christ is come in the
        flesh. This expression could not be employed respecting any mere man, as
        no one who was only a man could come except in the flesh. Since, then,
        Jesus Christ might have come in some other manner, these words affirm
        His humanity, while at the same time they prove His pre-existence.

        Ver. 4.— And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
        Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead. Declared to be
        the Son of God. — The word here translated ‘declared,’ imports,
        according to the sense of the original as well as the connection,
        defined or proved. The term properly signifies, to point out, or to
        limit, as when bounds are set to a field to regulate its measurement.
        Jesus Christ was made or became the Son of David; but He did not become,
        but was declared, defined, or demonstrated to be the Son of God. That
        Jesus Christ is not called in this place the Son of God with reference
        to His incarnation or resurrection merely, is evident from the fact that
        His nature as the Son of God is here distinguished from His descent from
        David. This expression, the Son of God, definitely imports Deity, as
        applied to Jesus Christ. It as properly denotes participation of the
        Divine nature, as the contrasted expression, Son of Man, denotes
        participation of the human nature. As Jesus Christ is called the Son of
        Man in the proper sense to assert His humanity, so, when in contrast
        with this He is called the Son of God, the phrase must be understood in
        its proper sense as asserting His Deity. The words, indeed, are capable
        of a figurative application, of which there are many examples in
        Scripture. But one part of the contrast is not to be taken as literal,
        and the other as figurative; and if the fact of a phrase being capable
        of figurative acceptation incapacitates it from expressing its proper
        meaning, or renders its meaning inexplicably uncertain, no word or
        phrase could ever be definite. A word or phrase is never to be taken in
        a figurative sense, where its proper sense is suitable; for language
        would be unintelligible if it might be arbitrarily explained away as
        figurative. This appellation, Son of God, was indeed frequently ascribed
        to pious men; but if this circumstance disqualified the phrase from
        bearings a literal and definite meaning, there is not a word or phrase
        in language that is capable of a definite meaning in its proper
        signification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle John says, ‘But these are written, that ye might believe
        that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,’ by which he means to say who
        Christ is. Paul, after his conversion, ‘preached Christ in the
        synagogues.’ And what did he preach concerning Him? — ’That He was the
        Son of God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The great burden of Paul’s doctrine was, to prove that Jesus is the Son
        of God. That term, then, must definitely import His Divine nature. It is
        not only used definitely, but as expressing the most important article
        in the Christian faith; it is used as an epitome of the whole creed.
        When the eunuch desired to be baptized, ‘Philip said, If thou believest
        with all thine heart, thou mayest. And He answered and said, I believe
        that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.’ The belief, then, of the import of
        this term is the substance of Christianity. Faith in Jesus Christ, as
        the Son of God, overcometh the world. ‘Who is he that overcometh the
        world, but he that believeth thatJESUS is the Son of God?’ In the
        confession of Peter, Matthew 16:16, this phrase is employed as an
        epitome of the Christian faith. To the question, ‘Whom say ye that I
        am?’ Peter replies, ‘Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.’ We
        have here the very essence of Christianity. It is asked, Who is Christ?
        The reply, then, must answer this question; it must inform us who Christ
        is, both as to His person, His office, and nature. Thou art the Christ,
        is the answer to the question, so far as it respects His person and
        office; Thou art the Son of the living God, is the answer as to His
        nature. The parable in which the king makes a marriage for his son,
        speaks the same doctrine, Matthew 22:2. Christ is there represented to
        be the Son of God, in the same sense in which a royal heir is the son of
        the king his father. If, then, the king’s son partake of the nature of
        his father, so must Jesus Christ, the Son of God, partake of the nature
        of His Father; if the king’s son be a son in the perfect sense of the
        term, and not a son figuratively, in like manner the Son of God is God’s
        Son in the proper sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question put to the Pharisees by Jesus, Matthew 22:42, proves that
        the phrase Son of God means sonship by nature. ‘What think ye of Christ?
        Whose Son is He?’ This question evidently refers to proper, not
        figurative sonship. When we ask whose son such a person is, it is
        palpably evident that we mean real, not figurative sonship. Though the
        question might have reference to our Lord’s human nature, and the
        inquiry relate to His father after the flesh, as the Pharisees
        understood, still it clearly denotes the natural relation; but that
        Christ did not intend it exclusively of His father as to the flesh, is
        evident from His next question: ‘If David, then, call Him Lord, how is
        He his Son?’ Jesus Christ could not mean to deny that He was the Son of
        David; but He intimates that, though He was the Son of David as to the
        flesh, He must be the Son of God in the same sense in which He was
        David’s Son. He asks, Who is the father of the Messiah? and from
        something affirmed of Him, intimates that there is a sense in which He
        is not David’s Son. The answer He received was true, but not full; the
        supply of the deficiency is ‘the Son of God’ The question, then, and the
        proper answer, imports that Jesus was the Son of God in the literal
        sense of the words. Besides, David could not call Him Lord as to His
        human nature; nor was He David’s Lord in any sense but that in which He
        was God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The condemnation, also, of unbelievers rests on the foundation of the
        Savior’s dignity as the Son of God. ‘ He that believeth not is condemned
        already; because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten
        son of God.’ They are condemned not merely for rejecting His message,
        but for not believing in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
        Faith, then, respects not His doctrine only, but Himself, especially as
        exhibited in His doctrine. Such sonship implies Deity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this Epistle, ch. 8, Paul argues that God will deny nothing to those
        for whom He has given His Son. But this argument would be ill founded,
        if Jesus be only figuratively His Son. ‘He that spared not His own Son,
        but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely
        give us all things?’ This supposes that the gift of Christ is greater
        than the gift of all other things besides, and that in such a
        disproportion as to bear no comparison. If so, can He be anything else
        than truly Divine? Had He been the highest of created beings, it would
        not follow as a self-evident consequence that such a gift of Him implied
        the gift of all things else.
      </p>
      <p>
        The epithets attached to this phrase, Son of God, show it to import
        proper sonship. Jesus is called God’s own Son, — the beloved — the well
        beloved Son, — the begotten — the only-begotten Son of God. This
        sonship, then is a sonship not only in a more eminent degree, but in a
        sense in which it is not true of any other in the lowest degree. God has
        other sons, but He has no other son in the sense in which Jesus is His
        Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has no other son who enjoys the community of His nature. Therefore
        this Son is called His begotten, or His only-begotten Son. A begotten
        son is a son by nature; and Jesus must be designedly so designated, to
        distinguish His natural sonship from that which is figurative. The
        phrase is rendered still more definite by the addition of the word only.
        Jesus is the\parONLY-begotten Son, because He is the only Son of God in
        the proper sense of the term. Other sons are figuratively sons, but He
        is the begotten Son, and the only-begotten Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase own Son imports the truth of the sonship by another term, and
        is therefore an additional source of evidence. Own Son is a son by
        nature, in opposition to the son of another, to a son by law, and to all
        figurative sons. Christ, then, is God’s own Son, because He is His Son
        by nature, because He is not His Son by adoption in the view of the law,
        and because He is His Son in opposition to figurative sonships.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the words, I and my Father are one , John 10:30, mean unity of
        nature, and not unity of design, is clear from our Lord’s account of the
        charge of the Jews: they charged Him with blasphemy for calling Himself
        the Son of God. ‘Say ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent
        into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the words used were not, I am the Son of God. The words I and My
        Father are one must therefore be the same in import as I am the Son of
        God; but if the expression, I and My Father are one, is the same in
        import as, I am the Son of God, the former cannot mean, I am one in
        design with My Father. Jesus, in the 36th verse, represents the Jews as
        charging Him with blasphemy, not for saying that He was God, but for
        saying that He was the Son of God. This incontrovertibly proves that the
        Jews understood the phrase, Son of God, as importing Deity. The phrase
        is blasphemous when applied to a mere creature in no other sense than as
        importing Deity. f5 That the Lord Jesus Christ, in his eternal equality
        with the Father, and not merely as God manifested in the flesh, is
        called the Son of God, flows directly from the fact that, wherever the
        first person of the adorable Trinity is personally distinguished in
        Scripture, it is under the title, the co-relative title, of the Father.
        And what is the objection to this doctrine of our Lord’s eternal
        sonship? It is simply that it differs from all our ordinary notions of
        the filial relation, to represent the Son as co-eternal with the Father;
        or that begotten must necessarily mean ‘derived,’ and that to grant
        derivation is to surrender Deity. In regard to the last form of the
        objection, it is only necessary to remark, that the doctrine of
        Scripture is not to be held chargeable with the vain and unprofitable
        speculations about derived personality, on which some of its upholders
        have adventured. And in regard to the first, it is not difficult to see
        that it is destitute of force, except on the impious assumption that we
        are not bound to receive any declaration about the Divine nature, about
        the deepest mysteries which are veiled from our reason, and revealed
        only to our faith, unless we can fully comprehend it. To demand that the
        distinction of persons in the undivided essence of the Godhead, and the
        mode of their eternal subsistence, shall be made plain to us; or to
        repugn against the doctrine of the eternal filiation of the Son of God,
        because it overpasses the boundaries of our notions of sonship, — what
        is this but the very summit of unthinking arrogance?
      </p>
      <p>
        What is it but to say that we will make our own narrow minds the measure
        of all things, — that we will accept nothing from pure respect to the
        authority of God, — that we will give the Faithful One only the credit
        which we allow to a suspected witness, receiving His evidence where it
        harmonizes with our own apprehensions, — and that, while to our feeble
        minds every insect is a mystery, there must be no arcana in the nature
        of Him who dwelleth in the light that is inaccessible? With power. —
        Some explain the meaning of this to be, that by His resurrection Jesus
        Christ was powerfully declared to be the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        But He was not merely powerfully declared — which would intimate the
        high degree of the evidence — but, according to the Apostle, He was
        absolutely declared to be the Son of God. Some, again, suppose that He
        was declared to be the Son of God by the power of the Father who raised
        Him up. If this had been intended, it would not, it appears, have simply
        been said, with power, but by the power and glory of the Father, as in
        Romans 6:4, and 2 Corinthians 13:4. The expression, with power, is to be
        construed with that of the Son of God which immediately precedes it, not
        with the word declared, and signifies invested with power. All power was
        inherent in Him, as ‘God blessed for ever;’ but it was given to Him as
        Mediator, as He Himself declares, Matthew 28:18, John 17:2, and clearly
        manifested by His resurrection. He then appeared possessed of eternal,
        sovereign, and universal power, and that in opposition to the semblance
        of weakness in which He had appeared on earth. The dignity of His person
        having remained for some time concealed under the veil of weakness, His
        resurrection gloriously displayed His ineffable power, as the Conqueror
        of death, and by His power also evinced His dignity as the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power which was given to our Lord when He rose from the dead, was
        eminently displayed by His sending out the Holy Spirit, when He returned
        to the Father. Before His resurrection, if only the veil of infirmity
        with which, in His birth, he had been covered, was contemplated, He
        appeared merely as a man. But after His resurrection, if we turn our
        eyes to His sending forth the Holy Spirit, we behold Him as the Son of
        God invested with all power. For He who thus sends forth this glorious
        Spirit must be possessed of sovereign and infinite power, and
        consequently must be the Son of God. The Holy Spirit, too, whom Jesus
        Christ communicates, marks His divinity by other characters besides that
        of power, namely, by that of holiness, by that of majesty, by that of
        eternity, and that of infinity, proving that He only who bestows the
        Holy Spirit can be the eternal God, sovereignty holy, and sovereignly
        glorious.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle has, however, chosen the characteristic of power for two
        reasons — the one is to oppose it to the flesh, denoting weakness; and
        the other, because He has overcome the world, which is an act of
        ineffable power. To destroy the empire of Satan, to subdue the hearts of
        men, to change the face of the universe, displays a power which is truly
        Divine. According to the Spirit of Holiness. — There are various
        interpretations of these terms, but the proper antithesis can only be
        preserved by referring them to Christ’s Divine nature. If the words are
        capable of this application, we need not hesitate to adopt it in this
        place; and though the phrase is unusual, there can be no doubt that it
        is capable of this meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is equally unusual in whatever sense it may be applied. This
        circumstance, then, cannot prevent it from referring to the Deity of
        Jesus Christ, in direct contrast to His humanity. Spirit of Holiness may
        be used here rather than the phrase Holy Spirit, because the latter is
        usually assigned to the third person of the Trinity. Though the exact
        expression does not occur elsewhere in the Scriptures, other passages
        corroborate this meaning, as ‘the Lord (that is, Christ) is that
        Spirit,’ 2 Corinthians 3:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is called ‘a quickening Spirit,’ 1 Corinthians 15:45, which character
        belonged to Him in a particular manner after His resurrection, when He
        appeared as the spiritual Head of His Church, communicating spirit and
        life to all His members. The unusual expression, Spirit of Holiness,
        appears, then, here to denote His Deity, in contrast with His humanity,
        characterizing Him as God, who is a Spirit essentially holy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us, connected with the preceding, we see that it is
        upon the foundation of the union of the Divine and human natures, in the
        person of the Messiah, that Paul proceeds to establish all the great and
        important truths which he sets forth in this Epistle. In another
        passage, he afterwards explicitly asserts this union: ‘Of whom, as
        concerning the flesh, Christ came who is over all, God blessed for ever.
        Amen.’ Romans 9:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same manner Matthew commences his Gospel. He traces the genealogy
        of the human nature of Jesus Christ, and afterwards declares His Divine
        nature, Matthew 1:18,21,23. Mark begins by proclaiming Him to be the Son
        of God. ‘As it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I send My messenger
        before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
        Lord (of Jehovah), make His paths (for our God) straight,’ Isaiah 40:3;
        Malachi 3:1. Luke introduces his Gospel by asserting His Divine nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        In speaking of the coming of John the Baptist, he says, ‘And many of the
        children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God; and he shall go
        before Him in the spirit and power of Elias;’ and then he declares His
        genealogy according to His human nature, Luke 1:16, and 3:23. John
        commences his Gospel by saying, ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the
        Word was with God, and the Word was God;’ and afterwards, ‘The Word was
        made flesh,’ John 1:1-14. Nearly in the same terms he commences and
        closes his first Epistle. The leading truth which the Apostles taught
        when they preached to the Jews at Jerusalem was, that Jesus is the
        Christ, the Son of God, the Messiah promised, who had been crucified,
        and who was raised from the dead, and exalted to the right hand of the
        Father; and the same great truth was declared to Cornelius, when the
        Gospel was first preached to the Gentiles. The foundation of all that
        the Apostle advances in the Epistle to the Hebrews, respecting the
        superiority of the new over the old covenant, is established upon the
        union of the Divine and human natures of Jesus Christ. Having announced
        that He is the Son of God, he determines the import of that title, by
        quoting a passage which ascribes to Him the name, the throne, the
        kingdom, the righteousness, and the eternity of God. ‘Thy throne, O God,
        is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy
        kingdom.’ The Apostle Peter begins his first Epistle by referring to the
        resurrection of Jesus Christ, and his second, by designating Him as ‘our
        God and Savior.’ And as in the last prophetical book of the Old
        Testament the Messiah is called Jehovah, so the prophetical book which
        terminates the New Testament opens with announcing Him to be ‘Alpha and
        Omega, the beginning and the ending, which is, and which was, and which
        is to come, the Almighty,’ and closes in a similar manner, ‘I am Alpha
        and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last,’ which
        signifies the self-existent eternal Jehovah. f6 By the resurrection from
        the dead. — His resurrection defined or determined Jesus Christ to be
        the person spoken of by the Prophets as the Son of God, and was the
        authentic and solemn judgment of God pronouncing Him to be His Son. As
        it is also written in the second Psalm, ‘Thou art My Son; this day have
        I begotten Thee, Acts 13:33. In Scripture, things are often said to be
        done when they are publicly declared and manifested. Then the Son of God
        was raised from the dead, His eternal dignity, which was before
        concealed, was brought to light. His Divine power, being infinite and
        unchangeable, could receive no augmentation of dignity or majesty. But,
        having chosen to appear among men enveloped as in a cloud of sufferings
        and apparent weakness, His glorification consisted in His emerging from
        that cloud, leaving the veil of infirmities in the tomb, without any of
        them adhering to Him, when, as the sun breaks forth in his splendor, He
        was gloriously manifested as the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        By His resurrection, God proclaimed to the universe that Christ was His
        only-begotten Son. The Apostle having in the foregoing verse called
        Jesus Christ the Son of God, here adds that He was declared to be the
        Son of God by the resurrection from the dead. His resurrection, then,
        did not constitute Him the Son of God; it only evinced that He was truly
        so. Jesus Christ had declared Himself to be the Son of God; and on this
        account the Jews charged Him with blasphemy, and asserted that He was a
        deceiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        By His resurrection, the clear manifestation of the character He had
        assumed, gloriously and for ever terminated the controversy which had
        been maintained during the whole of His ministry on earth. In raising
        Him from the dead, God decided the contest. He declared Him to be His
        Son, and showed that He had accepted His death in satisfaction for the
        sins of His people, and consequently that He had suffered not for
        Himself, but for them, which none could have done but the Son of God. On
        this great fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Paul rests the
        truth of the Christian religion, without which the testimony of the
        Apostles would be false, and the faith of God’s people vain. ‘But now is
        Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that
        slept.’ His resurrection is a sure pledge that they who sleep in Jesus,
        God at His second appearance will bring with Him. As He triumphed in His
        resurrection over all His enemies, so His people shall arise to victory
        and blessedness. Then they shall know the power of the resurrection of
        Jesus, the grandeur of that event, and their interest in it through
        eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrection of Jesus Christ proved His sonship, because He had
        claimed that character during His life, and had appealed in proof of it
        to His rising from the dead, John 2:19. Had this testimony been untrue,
        it could not have taken place. And it not only proved His own eternal
        power and Godhead, but also manifested His oneness and union in all the
        perfections and distinguishing characters which constitute Godhead, in
        common with the Father and the Holy Ghost, each of these glorious
        persons concurring in that act, as we learn from other Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professor Stuart, in his Commentary, asks in this place, ‘How could the
        resurrection declare, in any special manner that Christ was the Son of
        God? Was not Lazarus raised from the dead? Were not others raised from
        the dead by Christ, by the Apostles, by Elijah, and by the bones of
        Elisha? And yet was their resurrection proof that they were the sons of
        God? God did indeed prepare the way for universal dominion to be given
        to Christ by raising Him from the dead. To the like purpose is the
        Apostle’s assertion in Acts 17:31. But how an event common to Him, to
        Lazarus, and to many others, could of itself demonstrate Him to be the
        Son of God, ejn duna>mei — remains yet to be shown.’ This is feeble
        reasoning. It shows that Mr. Stuart is entirely mistaken as to the
        manner in which the resurrection of Christ bears testimony to His
        character. Jesus Christ came into the world professing to be the Son of
        God, and was put to death for that profession. His resurrection, then,
        was God’s seal to the truth of this claim. In itself, it did not testify
        whether He was God or only man, but it fully established the truth of
        everything He taught; and as He taught His own Godhead, His resurrection
        is proof of His Deity. But how could it ever be supposed that the
        resurrection of Lazarus would prove as much for him as for Christ?
        Lazarus did not, before his death, profess to be the Son of God, and
        Mediator. He never predicted his resurrection as an event which was to
        decide the justice of his pretensions; and had he done so, he would not
        have been raised to confirm a falsehood. Professor Stuart’s argument
        concludes as strongly against the proof of sonship, in any sense, from
        the resurrection of Christ, as against proper sonship. The mere fact of
        being raised from the dead is not evidence of being even a good man. But
        in whatever sense Jesus is the Son of God, His resurrection is here
        stated by the Apostle to be the grand proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before His departure, Jesus Christ told His disciples that when the
        Comforter came He should convince the world ‘of righteousness, because,’
        said He, ‘I go to My Father, and ye see Me no more.’ In raising Him from
        the dead, and receiving Him up into glory, God declared that the
        everlasting righteousness which the Messiah came to ‘bring in’ was
        accomplished. His honorable reception by His Father who sent Him,
        furnished the most complete proof that He had faithfully fulfilled the
        purposes of His mission. ‘For if,’ says Archbishop Usher, ‘He had broken
        prison and made an escape, the payment of the debt which, as our surety,
        He took upon Himself, being not yet satisfied, He should have been seen
        here again; Heaven would not have held Him more than Paradise did Adam,
        after He had fallen into God’s debt.’ To the same purpose says Bates,
        ‘If He had remained in the grave, it had been reasonable to believe Him
        an ordinary person, and that His death had been the punishment of His
        presumption; but His resurrection was the most illustrious and
        convincing evidence that He was what He declared Himself to be. For it
        is not conceivable that God should put forth an almighty power to raise
        Him, and thereby authorize His resurrection, if by robbery He had
        assumed that glorious title of the Son of God. If, indeed, a single sin
        which had been “laid on Him” had been left unexpiated, He must have
        remained for ever in the grave: death would in that case have detained
        Him as its prisoner; for the wages of sin is death.’
      </p>
      <p>
        By His incarnation, Jesus Christ received in His human nature the
        fullness of His Spirit; but He received it covered with the veil of His
        flesh. By His death He merited the Spirit to sanctify His people; but
        still this was only a right which He had acquired, without its
        execution. By His resurrection He entered into the full exercise of this
        right; He received the full dispensation of the Spirit, to communicate
        it to them; and it was then He was declared to be the Son of God with
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — By Whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
        to the faith among all nations, for His name.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the first acts of the power of Jesus Christ, after His
        resurrection, was to bestow His Spirit and His grace on those who were
        chosen by Him, to qualify them to be His witnesses and the heralds of
        His Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul was among that number, although appointed at a later period than
        the rest. We have received — He here speaks of himself in the plural
        number.
      </p>
      <p>
        He does not appear to use this style that he may include the other
        Apostles: what is true of him will, however, as to everything essential,
        apply to all the others. He distinguishes these two things, Grace and
        Apostleship. The first, which he had experienced in his conversion, and
        in every subsequent part of his course, he had received from Jesus
        Christ; and by Him also he was appointed to the office of an Apostle, to
        the discharge of which that grace was indispensably necessary. To the
        obedience of faith. — Paul, as an Apostle, was commissioned to preach
        the Gospel in order to the obedience of faith. Some understand this of
        the obedience which faith produces; but the usual import of the
        expression, as well as the connection in this place, determines it to
        apply to the belief of the Gospel. Obedience is no doubt an effect
        produced by that belief; but the office of an Apostle was, in the first
        place, to persuade men to believe the Gospel. This is the grand object,
        which includes the other. The Gospel reforms those who believe it; but
        it would be presenting an imperfect view of the subject to say that it
        was given to reform the world. It was given that men might believe and
        be saved. The obedience, then, here referred to, signifies submission to
        the doctrine of the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is quite in accordance with those passages in which the expression
        is elsewhere found, as in Acts 6:7; Romans 6:17, 16:26; Galatians 3:1; 2
        Thessalonians 1:8; 1 Peter 1:22; and in Romans 10:3; where the
        Israelites are charged with not submitting to the righteousness of God;
        and especially in the 16th verse of that chapter it is said, ‘But they
        have not all obeyed the Gospel; for Esaias saith, Lord, who hath
        believed our report?’ This is His commandment, that we should believe on
        the name of His Son Jesus Christ,1 John 3:23.
      </p>
      <p>
        The object, then, of faith, is not only a promise, but a promise
        accompanied with a command to accept it. For since it is God who
        promises, His majesty and authority accompany His promise. In respect to
        the promise, that which on our part corresponds to it is called faith;
        but in regard to the commandment which enjoins us to receive the
        promise, the act on our part is obedience. On this account, unbelief is
        rebellion against God. Faith, on the other hand, is an act of
        submission, or the surrender of ourselves to God, contrary to the
        natural opposition of our minds, in order that He may possess and
        conduct us, and make us whatever He pleases.
      </p>
      <p>
        When, therefore, that opposition is overcome by the weapons with which
        the Apostles were armed, namely, the word of truth, our submission is
        called the obedience of faith. ‘This is the work of God, that ye believe
        on Him whom He hath sent.’ The obedience of faith which His people
        render to Jesus Christ is an adoration which supposes His Deity; for
        when reason entirely submits and is swallowed up in His authority, it is
        a real adoration. ‘Faith,’ says Calvin on this passage, ‘is adorned with
        the title of obedience, because the Lord calls us by His Gospel, and by
        faith we answer when He calls us; as, on the contrary, unbelief is the
        height of all rebellion against God.’ Among all nations. — Paul here
        assigns the reason why he preaches to Gentiles, namely, that it is the
        destination of his office or apostleship, and not solely his own choice,
        Galatians 2:7. In past ages, God had suffered all nations, with the
        exception of the Jews, to walk in their own ways, although He had not
        left Himself without witness in the works of creation and providence.
        Both in the universal deluge, and also upon other occasions, He had
        manifested His wrath on account of sin, and His determination to punish
        it. But after the establishment of the nation of Israel in Canaan, after
        the institution of His public worship among them, and after He had given
        to them His written revelation, He did not generally interpose His
        authority in a visible manner to turn the nations from the ways they had
        chosen. Although, therefore, the times of this ignorance God winked at,
        He now commanded all men to repent. For ‘thus it is written,’ that when
        Christ suffered and rose from the dead, ‘repentance and remission of
        sins should be preached in His name among all nations,’ Luke 24:47. And
        accordingly Paul closes this Epistle by declaring that it was by the
        commandment of the everlasting God that the mystery, which had been kept
        secret from ages and generations, should be made known to all nations,
        in order to the obedience of faith. This was in conformity to the
        commission given by the Lord Himself to His eleven Apostles, to go into
        all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature; and likewise to
        the particular command afterwards received by Paul respecting the
        Gentiles, ‘To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
        and from the power of Satan unto God.’ Thus the Gospel of the
        uncircumcision was in a special manner committed to Paul, to which in
        the verse before us he refers. For His name. — The Gospel is preached
        among all nations for the obedience of faith, but paramount to this is
        the glory of the name of Jesus Christ. The name, the glory, and the
        authority of God have the same signification. The world was created for
        God’s glory, and His glory is the chief end of the restoration of
        sinners. The acts of His goodness to His people are declared to be done
        for His own name’s sake; and for the same end His judgments also are
        executed on sinners, for His own name, Romans 9:17. Men are very
        unwilling to admit that God should have any end with respect to them
        greater than their happiness. But His own glory is everywhere in the
        Scriptures represented as the chief end of man’s existence, and of the
        existence of all things. It is in the name of Jesus that His people are
        taught to pray; and we are baptized into the name of the Father, of the
        Son, and of the Holy Ghost, as into one name. This affords unanswerable
        proof of the divinity of Christ. Paul was a chosen vessel to bear His
        name before the Gentiles, Acts 9:15. This verse concludes the general
        introduction to the Epistle; the easy transition to the particular
        address should not pass unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 6. — Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>
        Those to whom Paul wrote, were included among the nations to whom his
        commission extended. He mentions this, that it might not appear strange
        that he addresses them for the purpose of instructing them, but that, on
        the contrary, they should receive what he wrote with due confidence and
        respect. He was unknown to them by sight; he was far distant from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        They might say, What interest had he in them? He assures them that his
        apostleship regarded and comprehended them, and that he did nothing
        beyond his calling when he desired to increase their knowledge, and
        confirm their faith. They were the called of Jesus Christ. Thus he had a
        double right, and was laid under a double obligation to address them,
        both as belonging to the nations to whom his commission extended, and
        also as having already become obedient to the faith. The apostolic
        commission consisted of two parts: first, to make disciples, and then to
        teach them to observe all things that Jesus had commanded. Thus Paul had
        a measure that reached even to those to whom he now wrote, as he had to
        the Church at Corinth, 2 Corinthians 10:13. Of Jesus Christ. — Not only
        called to Jesus, but called by Him; for He is not only that glorious
        person to whom we ought to go, but who Himself says, Come unto Me. The
        believers at Rome were called both with an external calling by the
        Gospel, and also with an internal calling by the Holy Spirit. Both these
        callings are ascribed to the Father, and also, as in this passage, to
        Jesus Christ, because the Son, as Mediator, is the minister of the
        Father, and executes all things for Him. As the high Priest of His
        people, He has done for them all that is required for establishing the
        New Covenant; but as the Prophet and King of His Church, He converts
        them and leads them to the Father. This expression, the called of Jesus
        Christ, imports that they belonged to Him, as in Isaiah 48:12, ‘Israel,
        my called,’ that is, who are mine by the right of calling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — to all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called, saints: Grace
        to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        To all. — The Apostle here addresses all the saints at Rome without
        distinction, whether they were Jews or Gentiles, rich or poor, learned
        or unlearned, bond or free. He does not distinguish the pastors from the
        people, but addresses himself to them all in common — what he writes
        being equally intended for their common instruction and edification. He
        addresses them by three designations, Beloved of God, Called, Saints.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were saints because they were called, and they were called because
        they were beloved of God. Their character as saints, then, was not the
        cause, but the effect, of their being beloved of God. Beloved of God. —
        In opposition to the rest of mankind, whom God hath left in unbelief and
        the corruption of the world. Here, then, is the electing love of God
        placed first in order. It is that love wherewith He loved them when they
        were dead in sins, Ephesians 2:5. It is the greatest love that God can
        show to man, being everlasting love, which originates with Himself. It
        is purely gratuitous, and does not spring from the foresight of anything
        worthy in those who are its objects; but, on the contrary, goes before
        all that is good in the creature, and brings with it infinite blessings.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has for its primary object Jesus Christ, the beloved of the Father;
        and those whom He beholds in Christ, although in themselves children of
        wrath, are beloved for His sake. This love is unvarying from eternity
        and through eternity, although God’s dealings towards His people may
        vary, as it is declared in the 99th Psalm, ‘Thou takest vengeance On
        their inventions.’ He may thus be displeased with them, as it is said,
        ‘The thing that David did displeased the Lord,’ but His love to them
        remains the same, like the love of a father to a child, even when he
        chastens him for his disobedience. Called. — The first outward effect of
        election, or of the love of God to His people, is His calling them, not
        merely by the word, which is common to many, but by the Holy Spirit,
        which is limited to few, Matthew 22:14. ‘I have loved thee with an
        everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee,’
        Jeremiah 31:3. The election, then, of believers is to be traced through
        their calling, 2 Peter 1:10, and their calling to the everlasting love
        of God. Saints. — The end of the Divine calling is to convert sinners
        into saints or holy persons. Their sanctification is not an eternal or
        figurative consecration, as that of Israel was, but a real consecration
        by which they are made to give themselves to God. It arises from union
        with Jesus Christ, which is the source of the sanctification of His
        people; and it consists in internal purity of heart, for God purifies
        the heart by faith. It supposes a real change of heart and disposition,
        a new creation, for ‘if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.’
        ‘That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
        Spirit is spirit.’ They were not then saints by natural birth, nor did
        they make themselves saints either in whole or in part; but they were
        made so altogether by sovereign grace resulting from sovereign love. All
        believers are saints, and in one sense all of them are equally
        sanctified. They are equally separated or consecrated to God, and
        equally justified, but they are not all equally holy. The work of
        sanctification in them is progressive. There are babes, and young men,
        and fathers in Christ. Some are weak in faith, and some are strong; but
        none of them are yet perfect, neither have they attained to that measure
        of holiness at which it is their duty constantly to aim, Philippians
        3:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are therefore to forget those things which are behind, and to reach
        forth unto those things which are before, and are commanded to ‘grow in
        grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.’ ‘The
        path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more
        unto the perfect day.’ ‘Certainly, according to Paul,’ says Calvin on
        this place, ‘the praise of our salvation does not depend upon our own
        power, but is derived entirely from the fountain of God’s love to us.
        What other cause but His own goodness can, moreover, be assigned for His
        love? On this also depends His calling, by which, in His own time, He
        seals the adoption in those who were first gratuitously chosen by Him.
        From these premises the conclusion follows, that none truly associate
        themselves with the faithful who do not place a certain degree of
        confidence in the Lord’s kindness to them: although undeserving and
        wretched sinners, being called by His goodness, they aspire to holiness.
        For He hath not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.’ Grace to
        you, and peace.— In this way the Apostles usually commence their
        Epistles to the churches. In those addressed to individuals, mercy is
        generally added to grace and peace. Grace is uniformly placed first in
        order, because it is the source whence peace and all the blessings of
        salvation flow. Grace is the free unmerited favor of God to sinners in
        the plan of salvation. Grace and peace are joined together, because they
        are separable. God communicates all blessings to those to whom He gives
        grace, and to none besides; for whatever does not proceed from grace is
        not a blessing. It is to the praise of His grace that God exercises
        mercy, and brings those who were His enemies into a state of peace with
        Him. Grace differs from mercy, as it regards the unworthiness, while
        mercy regards the sufferings, of its objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grace or favor is spoken of in Scripture in three points of view: either
        as the unmerited favor of God towards men, as existing in himself; or as
        manifested in the Gospel which is called the Gospel of the grace of God;
        or in its operation in men. Every part of redemption proceeds on the
        footing of grace. It originates in the grace of God, and flows, in its
        first manifestations and in all its after acts, from the same unceasing
        fountain, in calling, adopting, regenerating justifying, sanctifying,
        strengthening, confirming grace, — in one word, it is all of grace. On
        this account Peter calls God the God of all grace, which teaches that
        God is in Himself towards His people grace — grace in His very nature, —
        that He knows what each of them needs, and lays it up for them, and
        communicates it to them. The whole of the salvation of man, from the
        counsels of God from eternity, is planned and executed to ‘the praise of
        the glory of His grace,’ Ephesians 1:6; ‘who hath saved us and called us
        with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His
        own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
        world began,’ 2 Timothy 1:9.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the operation of grace in the soul, men are not simply passive, nor
        can it be said that God does a part and they do the rest; but God
        produces all, and they act all. God is the sole author and source of
        their acts, but they themselves properly are the agents. In some
        respects they are wholly passive, and in others wholly active. In the
        Scriptures, the same things are spoken of as coming from God, and as
        coming from men. It is said that God purifies the hearts of believers,
        Acts 15:9, and that they purify themselves, 1 John 3:3. They are
        commanded to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling,
        because it is God who worketh in them both to will and to do of His good
        pleasure, Philippians 2:12. It is not the Holy Spirit, but themselves,
        by virtue of His power, who love God and their neighbor, who fear the
        Lord, who confide in Him, and trust in His promises. Paul designates as
        fruits of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
        goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. The origin of them all is the
        Holy Spirit — it is from Him they are derived; but in their exercise or
        development they properly belong to believers. If any one falsely infers
        from the doctrine of grace that there remains nothing for man to do,
        because it is the grace of God that leads him to act, he understands
        neither what he says, nor whereof he affirms. He might with the same
        reason conclude that, as God is the Author of our existence, of our
        souls, and of all our faculties, therefore we can neither think, nor
        reason, nor love. Grace is in our hearts a living principle, implanted
        by God, and at His sovereign disposal. To exercise this principle, is as
        much our duty as to preserve our life and health; and as the care which
        these require demand attention and certain acts of the will, in the same
        manner the exercise of grace in the soul supposes corresponding
        dispositions and acts. But it is not thus with grace as manifested,
        which is an object of choice, received or rejected, according as grace
        has operated in us or not. In this manner, grace, as the principle of
        renovation, by the sole operation of the Holy Spirit, stands in
        opposition to every notion of independent power in man, by which it
        might be supposed he could regenerate himself; while, on the other hand,
        considered in its exercise, it supposes the efforts of man. Peace
        includes everything that belongs to the idea of tranquillity in its
        largest extent. But the foundation of all must be peace with God.
        Without this, the Christian can have no peace, though he should be on
        good terms with all mankind; but, possessing this, God will either give
        him peace with his enemies, or He will give him peace along with their
        enmity. The Christian may not only have peace, but joy, in the midst of
        persecution and external affliction. Peace with God is the substance of
        happiness, because without it there can be no happiness, and with it
        there is happiness, whatever else is wanting. This salutation, grace to
        you and peace, may be considered either as a prayer or a benediction. In
        the latter sense, it bears the character of apostolic authority. From
        God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. — God is the Father of our
        Lord Jesus Christ, and the Father of all who are in Him. Paul here
        speaks of God as both his Father and the Father of all those whom he
        addressed, and so constituting one family, whether Jews or Gentiles. God
        the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, are the source of all grace and
        peace, and can alone communicate these blessings, which are the gracious
        effects that flow from the covenant of love and favor of the Triune
        Jehovah. Here again we see an incontrovertible proof of the deity of
        Jesus Christ; for, if He were not God, He could not without impiety be
        thus joined with, or invoked along with, the Father to impart blessings,
        of which God alone is the author.

        Ver. 8. — First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, there
        your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I thank my God. — This is a first in order, as if Paul had said,
        I commence my Epistle by giving thanks to God. It proceeds from that
        feeling of piety which ought to pervade all our actions; at the same
        time he bestows on those whom he addresses the praise which they
        deserved. It is also a first in importance, as if he said, Above all, I
        render thanks to God for you. He shows that their state was a matter of
        great joy to him, arising both from his zeal for the glory of God, and
        from the interest he took in those whom he addressed. My God. — Paul
        calls God his God, indicating a lively and ardent feeling of love to
        Him, of confidence in Him, and of liberty of access, which includes a
        persuasion that his thanksgivings will be agreeable to God. It is also a
        confession of his duty, and of the obligations he is under to render
        thanks to God, because He is his God. It is, besides, an intimation of
        his own character, as walking in communion with God. This is an example
        of the working of the Spirit of adoption, and of a believer taking to
        himself, in particular, the blessing of having God for his God, and of
        being a partaker of all the blessings of the New Covenant, flowing from
        that most gracious declaration, ‘I will be their God, and they shall be
        My people.’ Of such appropriation there are numerous instances recorded
        in the Book of Psalms. ‘I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord
        is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in
        whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high
        tower,’ Psalms 18:1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Job says, ‘I know that my Redeemer liveth.’ ‘I live,’ says Paul, by the
        faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me. ’ Such
        language it is the privilege of every believer to use, and he will do so
        in proportion as the love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy
        Ghost, which is given unto him. The Christian can thus address God as
        his own God, and often he should do so even in his public declarations.
        This displeases the world, because it condemns the world. They affect to
        consider it as presumption, but it is only a proper expression of our
        belief of God’s testimony with regard to His Son. Studiously to avoid
        such expressions on proper occasions, is not to show humility, but to be
        ashamed of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul thanked God, through Jesus Christ, who is our Great High Priest,
        and presents the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar before the
        throne.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is through Him alone that all our worship and all our works in the
        service of God are acceptable. Thus, not only must our petitions ascend
        to the Father through the Son, but our thanksgivings also, according to
        the precept, ‘By Him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
        God continually, that is, the faith of our lips, giving thanks to His
        name,’ Hebrews 13:1,5. We can have no intercourse with God, but through
        the one Mediator between God and man, John 14:6; and except through Him,
        we are not permitted even to return thanksgivings to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul thanks God for all to whom he writes. He had addressed them all as
        saints, making no exception. It is to such exclusively that the
        apostolic Epistles are written, whether as churches or individuals, — as
        being all united to Christ, children of God, heirs of God, and joint
        heirs with Jesus Christ, — who should first suffer and afterwards reign
        with Him. In the first churches, in which everything was regulated by
        the Apostles according to the will of God, there may have been
        hypocrites or self-deceivers; but as far as man could judge, they were
        all believers; or is any among them appeared not to be such, the
        churches were told it was to their shame. If any were discovered who had
        crept in unawares, or were convicted of unbecoming conduct, or who had a
        form of godliness, but denied its power, from such they were commanded
        to turn away. They were not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers;
        wherefore it is said, ‘Come out from among them, and be ye separate.’ It
        was in the confidence that they obeyed such commands, that the Apostles
        addressed them all, as in the passage before us, as the children of God.
        In the same manner, in writing to the church at Philippi, Paul, after
        thanking God for their fellowship in the Gospel, and declaring that he
        was confident that He who had begun a good work in them would perform it
        unto the day of Jesus Christ, adds, ‘Even as it is meet for me to think
        this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my
        bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel, ye all are
        partakers with me of grace.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This mode of address runs through the whole of the apostolic Epistles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostles generally commence their Epistles with the most encouraging
        views of the present state and future prospects of those to whom they
        write, and on these considerations are founded the succeeding
        exhortations. They first remind those who are addressed of the rich
        grace of God towards them in Jesus Christ, and the spiritual blessings
        of which they are made partakers, for their strong consolation, and then
        they exhort them to a holy conversation becoming such privileges. Of
        this we have a striking example in the First Epistle to the Corinthians,
        which, although Paul had so many faults to reprehend in them, he
        commences by declaring that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus — that
        he thanked God always for the grace given unto them by Jesus Christ, who
        would also confirm them to the end, that they might be blameless in the
        day of His coming, reminding them that God was faithful, by whom they
        were called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. The
        number of times, no fewer than ten, in which, in the first ten verses of
        that Epistle, Paul introduces the name of Jesus Christ, should be
        remarked.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these Epistles we find no exhortations to unbelievers. This ought to
        be particularly observed, as being a key to them, without which they
        cannot be understood. This is no reason, however, for supposing that
        exhortations to believe the Gospel ought not to be addressed to those
        who are still in unbelief. The Gospel is to be preached to every
        creature, and all should be enjoined, first to believe it, and then to
        do all that God requires.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Book of Acts, when the Apostles preached to the unconverted,
        their subject was repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
        Christ. But in the Epistles, where they address believers, they also
        admonish and exhort them to the practice of every duty. There is no
        exhortation to the performance of any duty which does not imply that it
        is to be performed in faith. ‘Without faith it is impossible to please
        God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers are taught to regulate all their conduct according to the
        great things which the Gospel reveals, which are freely given to them of
        God; to be imitators of God, and to live not to themselves but to Him,
        as being not their own, but bought with a price, and therefore bound to
        glorify God in their bodies and in their spirits, which are His. Their
        obedience, as described in the Scriptures, is as much distinguished by
        its motives and its foundation from the morality of the unbelieving
        world, as it is elevated above it in its nature and effects. It is in
        all respects a life of faith, subject to the authority of God, and is
        practiced under the influence and direction of motives inculcated in the
        Gospel, of which the light of nature gives no knowledge. Those who have
        not this faith regard it as a barren speculation; but they who possess
        it know that it is the sole and powerful source of all their works that
        are acceptable to God, which are opposed to ‘dead works,’ Hebrews 9:14;
        and that no works are really good, however excellent they may appear,
        and however much esteemed among men, or useful in society, which do not
        proceed from faith. That your faith is spoken of — It is not the piety
        of the saints at Rome, but their faith, that is here noticed. Without
        holiness no man shall see the Lord; but it is faith in Christ that is
        the distinguishing mark of the Christian. Paul thanks God that the faith
        of those to whom he writes was spoken of. He thus acknowledges God as
        the author of the Gospel, not only on account of His causing it to be
        preached to them, but because He had actually given them grace to
        believe; for if God is thanked for the distinguished faith of
        Christians, then not only their faith is His gift, but also its measure
        and advancement. That faith is the gift of God, is a truth frequently
        declared, as in Matthew 16:17; Luke 17:5; Acts 11:21, 13:48, 16:14;
        Romans 12:3; Philippians 1:29. This is also acknowledged in all the
        thanksgivings of the Apostles for those to whom they write, and is
        according to the whole of the doctrine of the Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is from God that every good and every perfect gift descendeth, and a
        man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. For ‘all
        things,’ therefore, we are commanded to give thanks. Paul thanks God for
        his own prayers, 2 Timothy 1:3. Here, as in other places, Paul commences
        with thanksgiving, thus reminding us that every blessing is from the
        kindness of God. If we should observe this in blessings of small
        importance, we ought to do it much more with respect to faith, which is
        neither an ordinary nor a common blessing of God. Throughout the whole
        world. — That is to say, throughout the whole Roman empire, of which
        Rome being the capital, all that took place there was circulated
        throughout the whole civilized world. Their faith was proclaimed by the
        voice of all believers, who alone could form a proper opinion regarding
        it; for the reference is evidently to their approbation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unbelievers, who hated both the people of God and their faith, could
        give no proper testimony concerning it. The commendation of the servants
        of God was all that the Apostle valued. Thus the faith of the believers
        whom God had assembled at Rome was held up as an example; and the
        Apostle here declares, not only for their encouragement, but also to
        excite them more and more to the performance of their duty, that the
        eyes of all the servants of God throughout the world were upon them. He
        says, their faith was spoken of, not that he rests in this circumstance,
        or that he wishes them to rest in their reputation, as if he would
        flatter them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reputation in itself is nothing. If it be unmerited, it only convinces
        the conscience of imposture; and when it is real, it is not our chief
        joy. Paul regards it with reference to the believers at Rome, as a mark
        of the reality of their faith; and it is on this reality that he grounds
        his thanksgiving. It was a reason for thanksgiving that they were thus
        letting their light shine before men, and so glorifying their Father in
        heaven. The glory of all that is good in His people belongs to God, and
        all comes through Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
        gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in
        my prayers.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is my witness. — This is substantially an oath; and refutes the
        erroneous and mischievous notion of some who maintain, from a
        misapprehension of what is said by our Lord and the Apostle James, that
        all oaths are unlawful. Paul’s affection for those to whom he wrote was
        such, that, in making his appeal to God, he desires to expose it to His
        judgment in respect to its truth and sincerity. Whom I serve with my
        spirit. — All the service of God is of this kind; but it is here
        expressed for the sake of energy, and to distinguish the true servants
        of God, who serve in the Gospel with their heart in the work, from
        hirelings, whose labors are formal and only external. It expresses the
        sincerity and ardor of the service that Paul rendered to God, as if he
        had said, with all his heart and all the faculties of his soul. It also
        imports the nature of the service in which he was employed, namely, a
        spiritual service, in opposition to the service of the priests and
        Levites in the tabernacle, which was in a great measure a bodily
        service. On this account he adds, in the Gospel of His Son; that is to
        say, in the ministry of the Gospel in which he labored for the unfolding
        of the Divine mysteries to make them known. Thus Paul shows, from the
        character of his ministry, that his obedience was not in pretense only,
        but in sincerity. Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
        prayers — Some place these last words, ‘always in my prayers,’ in the
        beginning of the next verse, as in the Vulgate and the French versions;
        but the difference is not material. This is a striking proof of the
        frequency of Paul’s prayers, in which he interceded for those whom he
        was addressing — ’without ceasing’ — ’always.’ In like manner, in
        writing to the Philippians, he says, ‘Always, in every prayer of mine
        for you all, making request with joy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        We thus learn the duty of Christians to pray for one another, and that
        those who believe the Gospel are as much bound to pray for its success,
        and the prosperity of the churches, as to labor in the work. Both prayer
        and labor ought to go together. To pray without laboring is to mock God:
        to labor without prayer is to rob God of His glory. Until these are
        conjoined, the Gospel will not be extensively successful. From many
        other parts of Paul’s writings, we learn how assiduous he was in the
        duty of prayer, which he so earnestly inculcates on all believers. ‘In
        everything giving thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
        concerning you,’ 1 Thessalonians 5:18. ‘Be careful for nothing; but in
        everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your
        requests be made known unto God,’ Philippians 4:6. How precious is the
        promise connected with this admonition! ‘And the peace of God, which
        passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
        Christ Jesus.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But since all events are fixed, even from eternity, in the counsels and
        wisdom of God, of what avail, it may be said, are these prayers? Can
        they change His eternal counsels, and the settled order of events?
        Certainly not.
      </p>
      <p>
        But God commands us to pray, and even the prayers of His people are
        included in His decrees; and what God has resolved to do, He often gives
        to their prayers. Instead, then, of being vain, they are among the means
        through which God executes His decrees. If, indeed, all things happened
        by a blind chance, or a fatal necessity, prayers in that case could be
        of no moral efficacy, and of no use; but since they are regulated by the
        direction of Divine wisdom, prayers have a place in the order of events.
        After many gracious promises, it is added, Ezekiel 36:37, ‘Thus saith
        the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel
        to do it for them.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse Paul shows his zeal for God and his love for believers,
        which ought never to be separated. We should love our brethren because
        we love God. These two things corresponded in Paul to the two favors he
        had received, which he marked in the 5th verse, namely, ‘Grace and
        Apostleship.’ ‘God, as if he said, ‘has given me grace, and on my part I
        serve Him with my spirit; He has given me Apostleship, and I have you
        continually in remembrance.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
        prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making request. — Paul’s affection for those to whom he wrote impelled
        him, not once or twice with a passing wish, but at all times, to desire
        to be present with them, notwithstanding the inconveniences of so long
        and perilous a journey. He asks of God that by some means now at length
        he might be permitted to visit them. Thus Christian love searches out
        new objects on which to exercise itself, and extends itself even to
        those who are personally unknown. I might have a prosperous journey, by
        the will of God. — This teaches us that God, by His providence,
        regulates all that takes place. There is nothing with which Christians
        should be more habitually impressed, than that God is the disposer of
        all events. They should look to His will in the smallest concerns of
        life, as well as in affairs of the greatest moment. Even a prosperous
        journey is from the Lord. In this way they glorify God by acknowledging
        His providence in all things, and have the greatest confidence and
        happiness in walking before Him. Here we also learn that, while the will
        of God concerning any event is not ascertained, we have liberty to
        desire and pray for what we wish, provided our prayers and desires are
        conformed to His holiness. But will our prayers be agreeable to God if
        they be contrary to His decrees? Yes, provided they be offered in
        submission to Him, and not opposed to any known command; for it is the
        revealed, and not the secret will of God that must be the rule of our
        prayers. We also learn in this place, that since all events depend on
        the will of God, we ought to acquiesce in them, however contrary they
        may be to our wishes; and likewise, that in those things in which the
        will of God is not apparent, we should always accompany our prayers and
        our desires with this condition, if it be pleasing to God, and be ready
        to renounce our desires as soon as they appear not to be conformed to
        His will. ‘O how sweet a thing,’ as one has well observed, ‘were it for
        us to learn to make our burdens light, by framing our hearts to the
        burden, and making our Lord’s will a law!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
        spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul greatly desired to see the believers at Rome, to impart to them
        some spiritual gift. The opinion of Augustine, that this means the love
        of one’s neighbor, in which he supposes the church at Rome was
        deficient, has no foundation. It was not a new degree of the Spirit of
        sanctification that he desired to communicate, for this Paul had it not
        in his power to bestow, 1 Corinthians 3:6. He appears to refer to some
        of the extraordinary gifts conferred by the Apostles, by which they
        might be more established in their most holy faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — That is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the
        mutual faith both of you and me.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is . — This does not mean that what follows is intended as an
        explanation of what he had just said, for to those whom Paul addressed
        it must have been sufficiently clear; but is a modification of it
        respecting his purpose, lest he should appear to consider them as not
        well instructed or established in their faith. For although he always
        acted faithfully, no one, as is evident from his writings, was ever more
        cautious to avoid unnecessary offense. He therefore joins himself with
        those to whom he wrote, and refers to the advantage which he also
        expected reciprocally to derive from them. It is no valid objection to
        understanding it to be a miraculous gift which he desired to
        communicate, that he hoped for mutual advantage and comfort with those
        whom he was about to visit. This comfort or confirmation which he looked
        for, was not from a spiritual gift to be bestowed by them, but would be
        the effect of their confirmation, by the gift they received through him.
        The gift, too, bestowed by him, would be a new proof of the power of God
        in him, and of His approbation in enabling him to exert such power. He
        would be comforted and strengthened in witnessing their faith in respect
        to his own labors in his ministry, by seeing the kingdom of God
        advancing more and more, and with respect to his numerous afflictions to
        which he was on all hands subjected, and also in contrasting the
        coldness and weakness of many of which he often complains, when he
        observed the increasing power of Divine grace in the saints at Rome. On
        the other hand, they would derive from Paul’s presence the greatest
        consolation from his instructions in the mysteries of salvation, from
        his exhortations, which must contribute much to their edification, as
        well as from his example, his counsels, and his prayers. It is thus the
        duty of Christians to confirm each other in the faith; and their mutual
        intercourse makes known the faith that each possesses.

        They see that their experience answers as face answers to face in a
        glass; and by beholding the strength of faith in their brethren,
        Christians are edified and confirmed.

        Ver. 13. — Now, I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes
        I purposed to come unto you (but was let hitherto), that I might have
        some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul’s zeal and affection for those to whom he wrote, were not of recent
        origin; they had long been cherished in his heart. Of this he did not
        wish them to be ignorant. It is of importance that believers should know
        the love entertained for them by the servants of God. It is a testimony
        of the love of God Himself. Paul wished to see some fruit of his
        ministry among them. This was his great desire everywhere in the service
        of Christ. ‘I have chosen you and ordained you,’ said Jesus to His
        Apostles, ‘that ye should go and bring forth fruit;’ and Paul ardently
        longed to see the fulfillment of this gracious promise among those to
        whom he wrote, for believers were his joy and crown. As among other
        Gentiles. — The apostleship of Paul had not been unfruitful, ch. 15:17.
        He had traveled through a great part of Syria, of Asia, and of Greece,
        and everywhere he had either been the means of converting sinners or
        edifying believers. This was a source of much joy to him; but after so
        many labors, he did not wish for repose. He desired to go to Rome to
        obtain fruit there also. He had been let, or hindered, hitherto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our desires are always pleasing to God when their object is to promote
        His glory; but sometimes He does not see good to give them effect. It
        was good that it was in David’s heart, although he was not permitted, to
        build the house of God. The times and the ways of God’s providence are
        often unknown to us, and therefore our desires and designs in His
        service ought always to be cherished in submission to His Divine wisdom.
        Paul had been hindered till now from going to Rome. This may have
        happened in different ways, and through what are called second causes.
        It may have been occasioned by the services he found it indispensable to
        perform in other churches before leaving them; or it may have arisen
        from the machinations of Satan, the God of this world, exciting
        disturbances and opposition in these churches, 1 Thessalonians 2:18; or
        he may have been prevented by the Spirit of God, Acts 16:7. His being
        hindered, by whatever means, from going to Rome, when he intended it,
        shows that the Apostles were sometimes thwarted in their purposes, and
        were not always under the guidance of Divine inspiration in their plans.
        This, however, has nothing to do with the subject of their inspiration
        as it respects the Scriptures, or as it regards their doctrine. Thou who
        raise any objection to the inspiration of the Scriptures, from the
        disappointments or misconduct of the Apostles, confound things that
        entirely and essentially differ.

        Ver. 14. — I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to
        the wise and to the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul was their debtor, not by any right that either Greeks or Barbarians
        had acquired over him, but by the destination which God had given to his
        ministry towards them. He does not, however, hesitate to recognize the
        debt or obligation, because, when God called him to their service, he
        was in effect their servant, as he says in another place, ‘Ourselves
        your servants for Jesus’ sake.’ The foundation of this duty was not in
        those whom he desired to serve, but in God, and the force of this
        obligation was so much the stronger as it was Divine; it was a law
        imposed by sovereign authority, and consequently an inviolable law. With
        regard to Paul, it included, on the one hand, all the duties of the
        apostolic office, and, on the other, the dangers and persecutions to
        which that office exposed him, without even excepting martyrdom, when he
        should be called to that last trial. All this is similar to what every
        Christian owes in the service of God, as far as his abilities, of
        whatever kind they are, and his opportunities, extend.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Greeks — under which term all civilized nations were included —
        were the source of the arts and sciences, of knowledge and civilization,
        it might be said that the Apostle should attach himself solely to them,
        and that he owed nothing to the Barbarians. On the contrary, it might be
        alleged that he was debtor only to the Barbarians, as the Greeks were
        already so enlightened. But in whatever way these distinctions were
        viewed, he declares that both the one and the other were equal to him:
        he was debtor to them all, — to the Greeks, because their light was only
        the darkness of error or of idle speculation — to the Barbarians, for he
        ought to have compassion on their ignorance. He was debtor to the wise,
        that is to say, the philosophers, as they were called among the Greeks;
        and to the unwise, or those who made no profession of philosophy. He
        knew that both stood equally in need of the Gospel, and that for them
        all it was equally adapted. This is the case with the learned and the
        unlearned, who are both altogether ignorant of the way of salvation,
        till it be revealed to them by the Gospel, to which everything, by the
        command of God, the wisdom as well as the folly of the world, — in one
        word, all things besides, — must yield subjection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — So, as much as in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
        that are at Rome also.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul was always zealous to do his duty; at the same time, he always
        acknowledged his dependence on God. This is an example which Christians
        ought to imitate on all occasions, never to deviate from the path of
        duty, but to leave events in the hands of God. The contrary of this is
        generally the case. Christians are often more anxious and perplexed
        about their success, than with respect to their duty. They forget what
        regards themselves, and wish to meddle with what does not belong to them
        but to God. To you also. — He does not inquire or decide whether they
        ought to be reckoned among the Barbarians or the Greeks, the wise or
        unwise; he was ready to preach the Gospel to them all.

        Here terminates the preface to the Epistle. The first five verses
        include the general introduction, the last ten embrace the particular
        address to those to whom it is written. The introduction contains the
        name, the character, and the office of the writer; his vindication of
        the Gospel against the cavils of the Jews, proving that it was not a
        novel doctrine, and that the Apostles were not opposed to the Prophets.
        It authenticates the whole of the Jewish canon, and attests its
        inspiration. It undermines the errors of the Jews respecting tradition,
        and directs them to the Scriptures alone. It next announces the Messiah
        as the subject of the Gospel, — His glorious person as God and man, His
        birth and resurrection, His abasement and exaltation, and His almighty
        power. It finally asserts the communication of grace to the Apostle, his
        appointment to the office he sustained, the purpose for which it was
        conferred, along with a commission, of which he states the grounds, to
        all the nations under heaven. Where else shall be found so much matter
        compressed in so little space? where so much brevity connected with so
        much fullness?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the latter part, in which Paul addresses those to whom his Epistle
        was directed, he introduces many things well calculated to rivet their
        attention and engage their affections, while at the same time he conveys
        very grave and salutary instructions. What must have been the feelings
        of the Roman converts, when they saw the intense interest with which
        they were regarded by this great Apostle; when they considered the
        grandeur and value of the Gospel, to which he was about to call their
        attention in his Epistle; and when they were cheered by the hope of
        shortly seeing in the midst of them one whose heart glowed with such
        love to God, and such benevolence to them! All this must have tended to
        produce a reciprocal regard and reverential feeling towards the Apostle,
        an ardent desire to profit by his instructions, together with much
        gratitude to God, and many prayers to hasten his voyage to come among
        them. Paul did arrive at Rome, but, in the providence of God, in a very
        different manner, and in circumstances very different, from what he
        appears to have expected when he prayed for ‘a prosperous journey.’ He
        went there a prisoner in bonds, was shipwrecked on his voyage, and kept
        in confinement after his arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        But although he was bound, the word of God was not bound; and all fell
        out, in the adorable providence of God, for the furtherance of the
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The circumstances, however, in which he was placed were not in the
        meantime joyous, but grievous. Yet now that he stands before the throne,
        now that he has received the crown of righteousness, and is numbered
        among the spirits of just men made perfect, what regret can he
        experience that, during the few and evil days he spent on earth, he was
        conducted to Rome through persecutions, imprisonments, storms, and
        shipwreck, an outcast among men, but approved and accepted of God?
