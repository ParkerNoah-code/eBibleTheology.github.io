      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 17. — Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
        and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I beseech you, brethren. — The churches of Christ have here the most
        solemn injunction given, in the most earnest manner, with respect to a
        thing to which at one time or other they will all be found obnoxious.
        They are warned against the artful attempts of dangerous hypocrites,
        who, for sinister and interested purposes, endeavor to make divisions in
        the churches with which they are united. The injunction does not respect
        the conscientious errors of good men, but the plausible efforts of men
        who, under the mask of religion, are serving themselves. There is no
        essential difference, whether the divisions are internal or external —
        whether they are merely calculated to distract the body to which they
        belong — or whether they tend to schism or separation in fellowship.
        Indeed, the most dangerous and mischievous divisions are those which do
        not call for separation. They eat like a gangrene; and their authors
        should not be tolerated. Every Christian may profess and follow his own
        views of the will of his Master without exciting any division in the
        body of Christ; and even when he is called to separate, to maintain his
        fidelity to his Lord, this is not dividing the body of Christ, but the
        most effectual way to promote its union. The motive is not
        self-interest, or pride; but obedience to the will of God. Contrary to
        the doctrine which ye have learned. — The force of the passage lies in
        this sentence. The factious persons, against whom the Apostle here warns
        the church to which he writes, are to be watched and guarded against.
        Their motives are bad, and their efforts are contrary to the Gospel and
        the doctrine which the Church had already learned; for the Gospel
        teaches unity among all who believe in the Savior. They are all one, as
        united in Christ, the head of the body. Such persons are to be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men who, from a view of exalting themselves, endeavor to sow division in
        the Church, are more to be shunned than if they were infected with
        pestilence; and the brethren who are connected with them ought not, from
        their confidence in their own steadfastness, to expose themselves to
        their conversation on such subjects. Such persons are in the service of
        Satan, who will prevail to deceive the strongest of the people of God,
        if he obtains permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
        their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts
        of the simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Persons of this description serve not our Lord Jesus Christ. — To serve
        Christ is their profession; and this profession they may render
        plausible, but with all its plausibility it is a false profession. They
        are not doing the Lord’s work, for they are disuniting those whom Jesus
        has united. Instead of serving the Lord, they have a design of making
        gain by this conduct, which is equally to be condemned, whether they are
        led by vanity or ambition, or any other selfish motive not sanctioned by
        the word of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        No injunction ought to be attended to with more vigilance than this. The
        evil that is here condemned in the persons denounced by the Apostle is
        more dangerous than the open profligacy of those who turn away from the
        truth. No one could be deceived by the openly profane; but the
        hypocritical professions of such factious persons is calculated to
        injure or to destroy the Church of Christ, under the cloak of religion.
        And by good words and fair speeches. — Here the Apostle points out the
        means which those wicked persons employ to give them success. They use
        good words and fair speeches. Their soothing address is the bait by
        which Satan teaches them to ensnare the brethren. Accordingly, the
        Apostle says that in this manner they deceive the hearts of the simple.
        The authors of heresies have, in general, been remarkable for a winning
        manner and seductive address; and thus some of the Lord’s people may at
        least for a time be entangled in their snares. It is quite obvious that
        the injunction here given is not designed to discountenance Christians
        from denouncing any error or corruption that may have obtained place
        among His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The persons against whom the Apostle warns us are those who, for their
        own interest or selfish purposes, excite divisions among the brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calvin observes, ‘To separate such as agree in the truth of Christ is an
        impious and sacrilegious divorce; but to defend a conspiracy for
        promoting lies and impious doctrines, under the pretext of peace and
        unity, is a shameless calumny. The Papists have no foundation for
        exciting, by artful guile, an unfavorable impression and low opinion of
        us believers from this passage, for we do not attack and confute the
        Gospel of Christ, but the falsehoods of the devil by which it has
        hitherto been obscured.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
        therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which
        is good, and simple concerning evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. — The Apostle intimates
        here that he gave the believers at Rome these warnings, not from any
        peculiar jealousy with respect to their liability to err; on the
        contrary, he praises them for their ready obedience to the will of God
        as delineated by his Epistles. Obedience here may indeed respect their
        reception of the Gospel, which was a matter much spoken of, but it is
        not to be confined to this. It will apply to their readiness in
        receiving everything taught by the authority of God. The same authority
        that requires obedience to the Gospel, requires also obedience to every
        ordinance and precept. It is the greatest praise to any church or
        individual to obey cheerfully, with a childlike disposition, whatever
        the word of God teaches. Many Christians are not teachable, and while
        they have obeyed the Gospel to salvation, yet use their own wisdom in
        many other things respecting the institutions of God. They employ subtle
        and plausible reasonings, by which they impose on themselves and deceive
        others. This in the end will procure them neither honor nor profit. It
        will at last be found that he who submits most unreservedly to every
        tittle of the Divine injunctions, has been the wisest man. Blessed shall
        that servant be, who, when his Lord comes, shall be found doing His will
        fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obedience of the Roman Christians had been published most
        extensively; and this notice of the fact shows that it is important that
        the disciples should publicly make a profession of the Gospel, and of
        every commandment of the Lord. They should not be ashamed either of Him
        or of His word. They should boldly profess faith in His revealed
        character in every part of it, and of His ordinances and precepts even
        in the things most offensive to the world. This is to the honor of their
        Lord, and is designed as a testimony to men. Christians are not at
        liberty to decline obedience to anything that the Lord has appointed,
        out of fear of the reproach of the world. On the contrary, they are to
        hold forth before all men everything that God hath commanded. This is
        different from ostentation. To attend to any religious appointment to be
        seen of men, is the vilest hypocrisy. But to hold forth the will of God
        in things that the world hates, is true Christian obedience. I am glad
        therefore on your behalf — So far from suspecting the obedience of the
        brethren at Rome, the Apostle rejoiced concerning them. It was the
        greatest pleasure to him to hear of their obedience so extensively
        published. All Christians should imitate the Apostle in this joy. It
        should be matter of rejoicing to them to hear of believers in every part
        of the world fully obeying Christ. The disposition which the Apostle
        here manifests, and of which alone the Lord will approve, is a joy in
        hearing of Christ being honored, and the people of Christ advanced in
        devotedness to His will. We ought to be zealous for every part of our
        belief with respect to the will of God. But we should be on our guard
        lest this should arise from any selfish motive, and not solely from love
        to Christ and Christ’s people. Christ cannot be honored, and His people
        cannot be profited, when they practice the inventions of men as the
        appointments of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it is hurtful to believers, as well as injurious to the honor of
        Christ, when His people decline conformity to any part of His will,
        either from disaffection to it, or from a desire to avoid the offense of
        the cross. But yet I would have you wise unto that which is good. — This
        is the reason why he warned them against the authors of division. The
        Apostle wished them to be wise with respect to that which is good. They
        ought not only to understand the doctrines and ordinances of Christ, but
        also to be aware of the fact that even in the churches of Christ there
        would from time to time arise deceivers to lead away the simple. Had
        they not been warned of this, they might be ready to think that no evil
        person could ever be found among the disciples, who would thereby be
        liable to be ensnared by crafty men. Simple concerning evil — Simple
        here appears to mean not merely pure, as Dr. Macknight translates it,
        but simple as opposed to wise. The two words are here evidently
        contrasted. As to evil, the Apostle wishes the Christians to be without
        cunning, or dexterity, or skill. In this, it was his desire that they
        should be quite unknowing and unpracticed in the ways of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
        shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the God of peace. — After the exhortation which the Apostle had just
        given to the saints at Rome to maintain peace among themselves, he here
        designates their heavenly Father, as in the conclusion of the preceding
        chapter, the God of peace. God is the God of peace, because He it is
        that is the author of all the peace that His people enjoy. Were it not
        for the overruling power of the Lord, His people would have no rest at
        any time in this world. But the Lord Jesus rules in the midst of His
        enemies, and He gives His people peace in the midst of their enemies.
        This shows us that we ought constantly to look to God for this peace. If
        we seek it not, but grow self-confident and secure, dangers and troubles
        may arise from every quarter. Our only security is God, and our duty is
        constantly to ask peace of Him in the midst of a world of trouble. God
        gives His people different gifts; but peace is a blessing which they all
        need, and without which they can have no happiness. We ought, therefore,
        constantly to pray for peace to God’s people all over the world. We
        ought to pray for the peace of Jerusalem as our chief joy. Instead of
        thinking it strange that unbelievers should disturb us, or that Satan
        should stir up confusion even among Christians, it is owing to almighty
        power that His people have any peace on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in the churches there would be no peace, were it not for God’s
        presence. Such is the cunning of Satan, and the remaining ignorance and
        corruption of the Lord’s people, that Satan would keep them in continual
        broils, if God did not powerfully counteract him. God is here called the
        God of peace, with a peculiar reference to the factious persons against
        whom the believers were warned in the preceding connection. The
        emissaries of Satan strive to distract the churches; but God — the God
        of peace — counteracts their wicked designs. When it is considered that
        there is so much remaining evil in the best of children of God, it is
        amazing that they ever have peace. But it is the presence of God that
        gives them any degree of peace Were it not for this, no church could
        continue one day in peace. Shall bruise Satan under your feet. — Christ,
        the seed of the woman, bruised the head of the serpent, and His people
        will, through Christ, bruise Satan likewise. The word Satan signifies
        adversary. The term Devil means calumniator or accuser. He accuses the
        brethren before God day and night.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is called Leviathan , the Serpent , the great Dragon , the old
        Serpent , the Tempter , Beelzebub , a Murderer , a Liar , Prince of this
        world, Ruler of darkness, God of this world, Prince of the power of air,
        Belial, the Angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue
        is Abaddon , but in Greek hath his name Apollyon , that is destroyer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here encourages the believers to sustain the combat against
        Satan, their mortal enemy, who does everything in his power to disturb
        their peace, and to tempt them to all evil. There were two victories to
        be obtained over Satan. By the first, his head was to be bruised under
        the feet of Jesus Christ; and by the second, the rest of his body will
        be bruised under the feet of the believers. Of the second of these
        victories, Paul here speaks. In the first prediction, God speaks as the
        Lord of Hosts, the God of war — ’I will put enmity.’ The war continues
        till the bruising of Satan’s head has taken place, and his empire is
        overthrown; and when it is subverted, peace is made, and God is the God
        of peace . As, then, the seed of the woman has bruised the head of the
        serpent, so His people will through Christ likewise bruise Satan. The
        Apostle says not we shall bruise him under our feet, but God shall do
        it; yet he says not He shall bruise him under His own feet, but under
        yours. The victory shall be ours, though wrought by Him; and He shall do
        it shortly. The God of peace shall subdue that grand disturber of our
        peace, and shall give us perfect victory, and after it endless peace; He
        shall free us of this trouble and molestation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not, then, in our own power that we must encounter this adversary;
        it is God who bruises him under our feet. ‘We wrestle not against flesh
        and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
        rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
        high places;’ and it is only when covered with the armor of God and by
        His power that we can overcome enemies so formidable. Dr. Macknight says
        of the word Satan, that ‘Here it is given to the unbelieving Jews, and
        also to the Judaizing teachers and their adherents, who, for selfish
        purposes, bred divisions at Rome, ver. 17, and in every church where
        they could obtain a footing; they are therefore called ministers of
        Satan’ 2 Corinthians 11:15, etc. But it is of Satan himself that the
        Apostle speaks. Though Satan works by his instruments are crushed, he is
        crushed. Paul wrote this Epistle, and Tertius wrote it, — the one as
        dictating, the other as amanuensis. But when Paul is said to write the
        Epistle, we are not to say that Paul means Tertius. Satan works
        personally in disturbing the churches, though his work is carried on
        through the instrumentality of men. He excites his emissaries and
        suggests his devices to them, and they are successful through his
        artifices. Shortly. — Some understand this of the final victory that all
        the Lord’s people will obtain at last over Satan and all his emissaries.
        But though they will not be free from the attacks of this subtle
        adversary as long as they are in the body, yet from the phrase
        ‘speedily,’ or ‘shortly,’ no well as from the immediate reference to the
        power of God in the Church, it appears rather to refer to a present
        victory. The meaning, then, is, that all the churches of Christ are to
        be hurt by factious people rising up among them, emissaries of Satan,
        under the cover of religion; and if the Church is not led away by the
        error of Satan, God, as the God of peace, will shortly deliver them from
        the malignant influence of this apostate spirit. Satan will not be
        permitted to harass them continually. It is consistent with God’s wisdom
        to permit Satan to try His people; but when they are sufficiently tried,
        they are delivered from the temptation. So it was with the Son of God
        Himself. Satan was for a time permitted to harass Him, but at last he
        was dismissed. In like manner, churches and individual Christians are
        all to be tried in various ways; but if they abide the trial, they shall
        be delivered from the temptation, and, in the most emphatic and
        extensive sense, they shall all at last bruise Satan under their feet.
        They shall obtain a complete victory over him in the day of the
        appearing of their almighty Lord, who will then finally consign him to
        his awful punishment, and cast him into the lake of fire and brimstone.
        On that day the full import of this expression will be seen. The grace
        of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. — This form of expression has
        always been understood to import the deity of Jesus Christ, and justly
        it has been so understood. It is essentially and necessarily a prayer to
        our Lord Jesus Christ; and if He is not God, what grace has He to bestow
        on His people? ‘My grace,’ said He to Paul when praying to Him, ‘is
        sufficient for thee; for My strength is made perfect in weakness.’ It
        implies that there is a constant supply of grace to be communicated from
        Christ to His people; and if Christ so communicates His holy influences
        to His people in all ages, in all countries, to every individual of
        them, at every instant of time, what can He be but the almighty God?
        This implies that they who have been bought by the blood of Christ are
        to be supplied with grace by Him continually, in order to their standing
        in the truth. All their perseverance is in virtue of this. Of His Church
        it is said, ‘I, the Lord, do keep it; I will water it every moment; lest
        any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.’
