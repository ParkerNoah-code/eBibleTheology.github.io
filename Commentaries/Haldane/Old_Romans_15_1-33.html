      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 15:1-33</p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
        weak, and not to please ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        WE then that are strong. — The Apostle continues here to treat of the
        subject of mutual forbearance among Christians, raking himself with
        those who are strong in the faith, and who know that under the new
        covenant there is no longer any distinction in the sight of God between
        different kinds of meat, or any sanctity in the feast days enjoined to
        be observed under the Jewish dispensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To know the mind of God, as revealed in the Scriptures, is to be strong;
        to be ignorant of it, is to be weak. It is not the man of the greatest
        intellectual vigor who is strong, nor the imbecile in understanding who
        is weak. Many of those who possess the greatest talents, and are most
        distinguished for mental acquirements, even although Christians, may be
        weak in respect to the things of God. And many who are of feeble
        intellect, may be strong in the knowledge of Divine things. Ought to
        bear the infirmities of the weak. — Mr. Stuart explains the word here
        used as signifying ‘to bear with, to endure patiently, to tolerate.’ The
        word, indeed, denotes both to bear and to bear with; but here it is
        evidently to be taken in the former signification. The allusion is to
        travelers assisting a weak companion, by taking a part of his burden and
        carrying it for him. The strong believer is to carry the weak believer’s
        burden, by acting as if he had the same weakness, and abstaining from
        whatever would cause the weak brother to sin. Strictly speaking, it is
        improper to speak of one believer bearing with, enduring, or tolerating
        the opinions of another, for over these he has no control. God only is
        the Lord of the conscience. The man who speaks of tolerating the belief
        of another speaks improperly. And not to please ourselves. — If there be
        not a spirit of love, there will be a proneness in men to bring forward,
        and to urge with vehemence anything in which they have received more
        light than their brethren. This is not for the good of their weak
        brethren, but to please themselves, and discover their own superior
        acquirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — Let every one of us please his neighbor for His good to
        edification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let every one of us please his neighbor. — Though no part of the truth
        of God is to be sacrificed to peace, yet everything consistent with
        truth ought to be done to avoid giving offense, or stumbling weak
        brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some persons seem to value themselves on their setting at naught the
        opinion of their brethren; but this we see is far from the doctrine of
        the Apostle. We are not to gratify our own humor, but to do everything
        in our power, consistent with our duty, to please our brother. For his
        good. — Mr. Stuart renders this ‘ in respect to that which is good,’ or
        ‘so far as we may do so and do what is good.’ The common version is
        preferable, and conveys the true meaning. We are to please our brethren
        only for their good. It is for their good not to be urged to do what
        they cannot do with a good conscience; but it is not for their good to
        have any part of the will of God concealed from them. Besides, to
        abstain from meats is not a good in itself. To edification. — This is
        the way in which it is for their good to treat them in the manner
        recommended. It is for their edification. Such treatment will convince
        them of the love of those by whom they are so treated, and will be the
        surest way to lead them forward to clearer views in the points in which
        they are ignorant. To urge them forward with dictatorial zeal, would
        shut their eyes closer, and prevent them from perceiving the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For even Christ pleased not Himself, but, as it is written,
        The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me.
      </p>
      <p>
        For even Christ pleased not Himself — The Apostle confirms his
        injunctions by the example of Christ. He did not please Himself, or look
        for the favor of men; but instead of this, voluntarily acted in such a
        way as to subject Himself to every inconvenience and evil for the good
        of His people. If, then, our Lord Himself acted in this manner, how does
        it condemn a contrary practice in His people, if they indulge their own
        humor at the expense of those for whom Christ died! But, as it is
        written. — Instead of directly referring to the history of the life of
        Christ, the Apostle refers to the Old Testament, which testified of Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chief facts in the life of Christ were in one way or other
        predicted, and foreshown in the law and the Prophets. The manner in
        which they are quoted by the Apostle at once shows their bearing, and
        attests their application to the great Antitype. The actions of our Lord
        were ordered in such a manner as to fulfill what was written concerning
        Him. The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me. — The
        reproaches of those who reproached His Father fell upon His
        only-begotten Son when He was in the world. This imports that all the
        reproaches cast upon God’s people, on account of their obedience to God,
        are really directed against God Himself. It imports that all the
        opposition made to Christ was really opposition to His Father. The
        reason why Christ was so much hated and opposed was, because He revealed
        or manifested the Father. Had He avoided this, He would have been
        applauded by the world. Men, even the most wicked, approve of morality
        and acts of kindness to the human race. They hate Christ and Christians
        only because of their holding forth the character of God, which they
        dislike. Had Christ sought to please Himself, He would have avoided
        whatever excited the enmity of the multitude. When, therefore, the
        people reproached Him, because He pleased His Father and declared His
        will, it was His Father whom they reproached. The great aim of the
        intercourse of Jesus Christ with men, as it referred to them, was their
        good, and not His own pleasure. He bore the infirmities of the weak,
        accommodating His instructions to the capacities of those whom He
        addressed. But because of this condescension He was reproached by
        others. When He was found in company with the ignorant, to teach them,
        He was reproached as ‘a friend of publicans and sinners.’ This appears
        to be the meaning and application of this quotation, which at first
        sight does not seem clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
        our learning; that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures,
        might have hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
        learning. — This observation appears to refer to the Apostle’s reason
        for making the preceding quotation. He might have referred, as already
        remarked, immediately to the history of the life of Christ; but instead
        of this, he quotes from a passage in the Psalm. Here he justifies his
        doing this, and makes an observation which applies generally to the Old
        Testament and shows us in what manner we ought to use it. Some persons
        have blasphemously said that the Old Testament is now out of date. But
        the writers of the New Testament give no such view of the Old. Instead
        of this, they refer to it as proof, and treat it as of constant use to
        the people of God. All that is therein written, whether history, types’
        prophecies, precepts, or examples, although under another dispensation,
        is intended for the instruction of believers, to train them to patience,
        and to impart the consolation which the Scriptures provide for those
        that have hope in God. ‘take, my brethren,’ says James, ‘the prophets,
        who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering
        affliction, and of patience.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage quoted in the preceding verse is not only useful to us, as
        applicable to Christ, but it is, as the Apostle shows, useful as an
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the reproaches of those who reproached God fell upon Christ, the
        people of God ought to live and act in such a manner as the Apostle
        elsewhere enjoins, when he says ‘Let us go forth, therefore, unto Him
        without the camp, bearing His reproach.’ If Christ did not please
        Himself, neither ought His people to please themselves, but to please
        Him and His people for their edification. That we through patience and
        comfort of the Scriptures. — Mr. Stuart understands this of our
        patience, and translates the second word by admonition or exhortation:
        ‘That through patience, and by the exhortation of the Scriptures, we
        might obtain hope. But it is through the patience exhibited in example
        in the Scriptures that we are to have hope. And though the original word
        signifies exhortation as well as comfort, yet here the latter is to be
        preferred. In the next verse, with reference to this declaration, God is
        called the God of patience. Now God is the God of consolation, that is,
        the God who is the author of consolation to His people. But to call God
        the God of exhortation, would be an uncouth expression. Might have hope.
        — We ought to read the Scriptures with a view not to gratify our
        curiosity, but to increase and nourish our hope of future glory. This
        passage teaches that we should encourage ourselves by the example of
        those who, amidst similar temptations, have overcome. For this purpose,
        the conduct of those who obtained a good report through faith is set
        before us, that we may not be slothful, but followers of them who,
        through faith and patience, inherit the promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
        like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the God of patience and consolation. — The Apostle having in the
        preceding verse spoken of the patience and consolation which the
        Scriptures communicate, here designates God as the God of patience and
        consolation, and prays to Him, who is infinitely patient, and the source
        of all consolation, to grant that the believers at Rome might be
        like-minded.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is called the God of patience and consolation, because He is the
        author of patience and consolation to His people. Patience is essential
        to a Christian, and so is consolation; but neither in himself nor from
        any other source, but from God, has he these graces. We cannot bear the
        evils of the cross without Divine support. The virtues, then, of the
        Christian character are as much the fruit of the Spirit of God as faith
        is His gift. Everything good in the man of God is of God: all his sins
        are his own. When, therefore, we are in straits, difficulties, or
        troubles, we ought to look to God for patience to bear what He may see
        good to lay upon us, and for consolation under the burden. The form of
        the expression, God of patience, shows not only that God gives patience
        to His people, but that He gives it abundantly, and that there is no
        other source of this gift. Grant you to be like-minded — Mr. Stuart
        understands the expression translated like-minded to relate to matters
        of belief. It is true that it has this signification, but it is equally
        true that it refers to the will and affections, and in this place, in
        accordance with the common version, it is to be so understood. There may
        be unity of sentiment in error, as well as in truth. Christians should
        labor to effect union of belief in all matters, because it is their duty
        to endeavor to know whatever God has revealed, and not merely for the
        purpose of union of sentiment, in order to walk together in church
        fellowship. It is true that union of belief in all things tends much to
        harmony; but it is likewise true that difference of sentiment in some
        things tends more to manifest the degree of advancement in the things of
        God. There may be harmony from perfect agreement in belief, when there
        is not only error, but little of the true principle of harmony; for the
        true principle of harmony is love to Christ’s people for Christ’s sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also true that if we look to the New Testament, we do not always
        find perfect agreement in sentiment among the brethren. Although,
        therefore, the thing is desirable, it is not always to be expected, and
        much less is it to be made a term of communion. Christians are to walk
        together in the things in which they are agreed, and to differ without
        condemning each other. This is quite consistent with every degree of
        zeal for the interest of every truth about which they may differ,
        Philippians 3:15,16. If there be any who think that union of sentiment
        among Christians is not highly desirable, they are certainly far
        mistaken, and not of the same mind with the Apostle, who shows such
        earnestness on that subject. For surely it is desirable that Christians
        should know all that God has revealed; and if they know this, they will
        have this unity. But a thing may be very desirable which is not
        essential to their fellowship, and, as a matter of fact, no two
        Christians have such an union of sentiment. There are among them babes,
        young men, and fathers, and they are of the same mind about Divine
        things, just as far as they are respectively taught by the Spirit. The
        faith of Christ is required absolutely in all who have a right to
        fellowship in a church of Christ; but fellowship is not to be refused to
        him whom we acknowledge that Christ has received According to Christ
        Jesus. — Mr. Stuart understands this as meaning ‘in accordance with the
        Spirit of Christ, or agreeably to what Christ or the Christian religion
        requires.’ It undoubtedly means, according to the example of Christ
        Jesus, and accords with the expression, ‘Let this mind be in you which
        was also in Christ Jesus,’ Philippians 2:5. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight understands it of the example of Christ, but he also includes
        the will of Christ. But these two meanings the phrase cannot have in the
        same place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — That ye may wish one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
        Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        That ye may with one mind and one mouth. — With one mind means
        accordance in affection and heart. Union of affection is much more
        necessary to harmony in worship than perfect harmony in sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be harmony in the service of God among Christians who differ
        upon many things. But if any two of them are disaffected to one another,
        there is no harmony, though they should both have perfectly the same
        judgment in all matters. It is in this view that the Apostle charges
        Euodias and Syntyche that they should be of the same mind. Disaffection
        towards each other was the evil under which they labored, and not
        difference about any matter of belief. One mouth. — That is, this
        harmony should be as complete as if they all uttered their voice through
        one mouth. It is delightful to see a body of Christians all uniting in
        prayer and praise with one heart, while there may be a great variety in
        their attainments in the knowledge of Christ. On the other hand, there
        may be a professed union in everything, without having the mind that
        Christ here requires. The union of Christians in professed faith will
        not compensate for their want of union in Him. Glorify God. — God is
        glorified in the prayers and praises of His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This object, then, they should never forget. They should acknowledge Him
        and praise Him in every part of His character, however offensive it may
        be to the world. He is glorified by them literally with one mouth in
        prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He who prays is to be considered as uttering the prayer of the whole
        multitude of disciples, and each of them should follow in spirit,
        praying with him as he utters the words. Even the Father of our Lord
        Jesus Christ. — God is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He
        is the God of Christ as man, and He is the Father of Christ as God. The
        titles Father and Son, as applied to Christ and His heavenly Father,
        most evidently apply to relation in Godhead. Great efforts have been
        made by some to overturn this view; but their efforts have been without
        success, and they have been most mischievous in taking away one of the
        strongest proofs of the deity of Christ and one which the Scriptures
        most frequently use. The dignity of the character of Christ is most
        frequently asserted in calling Him the Son of God. But if He be the Son
        of God in a lower sense, or one corresponding with that in which it is
        applicable to every good man, no definite view of His character is given
        when He is called the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Wherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us to
        the glory of God . Wherefore. — That is, since Christians ought not to
        please themselves, but to act in everything for the edification of each
        other, they ought to receive one another, notwithstanding differences of
        sentiment among them. Receive. — Mr. Stuart understands this as
        signifying to show kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the word means only receive. It expresses nothing of kindness. It
        refers to the reception of each other as Christians to the fellowship of
        the Church. They ought, indeed, to manifest kindness with respect to all
        who are thus received, but the word does not express this. This method
        of giving, as is thought, a more emphatic meaning to words than usually
        belongs to them, is attended with the worst effects. Here it conceals a
        most important part of the will of God respecting the grounds or which
        Christians should receive each other to church fellowship. The command
        to receive into fellowship is turned into a command to show kindness. As
        Christ also received us. — The manner in which Christians are to receive
        one another to church fellowship is as Christ has received them. As, or
        according as. — Now Christ has received, and does receive, all who
        believe the truth even in the feeblest manner. He accepts those who have
        the lowest degree of faith in Him. Thus He received the afflicted
        father, who said, ‘Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief.’ Christ
        receives those who are ignorant of many things — indeed of everything
        but faith in Himself. The most ungodly is saved by Him the moment he
        believes; and Christians are received by Him, and live upon Him by
        faith, while they are in error as to many parts of His will. If Christ
        receives His people, notwithstanding their ignorance of many parts of
        His will, ought they to reject those whom He hath received? To the glory
        of God. — Some understand this of the glory which God shall bestow upon
        His people. But this cannot be the meaning here, as we are not yet
        received to His glory; whereas the glory here spoken of is already
        manifested. The glory which God will confer upon His people is future.
        ‘By whom, also, we have access by faith into this grace wherein we
        stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God,’ Romans 5:2. We have
        present access into the favor and grace of God, but we have now only the
        glory of God in hope. The glory of God, then, here means the glory that
        belongs to God’s character. It is to the glory of God that Christians
        are received and saved by His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
        for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I say. — The Apostle proceeds to reconcile the Jews and Gentiles to
        each other, by showing them the reason why Jesus Christ, who was equally
        the Lord of the Jews and the Gentiles, was born a Jew, as a minister of
        the circumcision. Jesus Christ was made under the law and ministered
        among the Jews; and though He gave some examples of His purpose of mercy
        to the Gentiles, yet He did not go out to preach to the nations. But
        this exclusive service among the Jews is not to be understood as
        indicating an exclusion of His mercy from the nations. It was for the
        truth of God. It was to fulfill the predictions and promises of
        Scripture, to confirm the promises made to the fathers. His ministry was
        the fulfillment of the promises that God had made to His ancient
        servants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy; as it
        is written, For this cause I will confess to Thee among the Gentiles,
        and sing unto Thy name.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy. — Though Christ’s
        personal ministry was limited to the Jews, yet the efficacy of His work
        was not confined to them. The Old Testament itself contains evidence
        that the Gentiles were to be interested in His redemption. It was the
        purpose of Christ’s work that Gentiles as well as Jews might glorify God
        on account of His mercy. The glory of God is therefore exhibited as the
        reason of Christ’s work. This is the highest object of all God’s works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salvation is also represented as mercy. There is nothing here or
        anywhere else in Scripture to encourage the presumption of men who
        suppose that they can merit salvation by their own works. Salvation is
        of mercy. In the preceding verse, Paul had spoken of the truth of God:
        here he speaks of His mercy. That which was truth to the Jews, having
        been promised to their fathers, was mercy to the Gentiles, who were
        admitted to participate in the blessings promised. This the Apostle
        proves by the different passages he quotes, which declare that the mercy
        of God was to be extended to all nations. Consequently both Jews and
        Gentiles had the strongest reasons thus presented to them neither to
        condemn nor to despise one another, but, on the contrary, to regard
        themselves united in Christ Jesus, as well as by the common sentiment of
        their obligations to Him, and the love He had shown them. ‘He is our
        peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of
        partition between us.’ As it is written. — Paul quotes a passage from
        the Old Testament to show that Christ was to be the Savior of the
        Gentiles as well as of the Jews. For this cause, etc. — In the passage
        referred to, Christ is represented as confessing or acknowledging God
        among the Gentiles, and singing to the praise of His name. Christ did
        not appear personally among the Gentile nations. This prediction, then,
        must be fulfilled of Him in His people, as one with Him. Than this
        nothing more clearly proves the unity of Christ and His people. What He
        does for them, they do, as they are one with Him. It is thus that
        believers are saved in righteousness as well as in mercy. Christ’s
        righteousness is their righteousness, because they are one with Him.
        Those who repudiate the doctrine of imputation of Christ’s
        righteousness, as both Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart have done, and that
        in a manner the most explicit and unreserved, not merely corrupt, but
        utterly overthrow the Gospel, and entirely remove the grounds of the
        justice of the Divine procedure in the plan of redemption. Grace reigns
        through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. In
        the eighteenth Psalm David speaks of himself, and the things spoken are
        applicable to him; yet the Apostle here quotes the words as applicable
        to Christ. This shows most incontrovertibly that David was a type of
        Christ, and that what is spoken of the type is in its ultimate sense
        spoken of the Antitype.

        Ver. 10. — And again He saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        And again He saith. — That is, God saith this, but it was Moses that
        said it, therefore what Moses here said was dictated by God. The words
        are the words both of God and of Moses. Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His
        people. — This quotation is from Deuteronomy 32:43. The Gentiles are
        there called upon to rejoice in fellowship with the people of God. This
        implies that they were to be converted by the Gospel, and united with
        the Jews in the Church of Christ. Calvin says, ‘I do not agree with
        those who consider this quotation to be taken from the song of Moses;
        for the Jewish lawgiver intends, in that part of his writings, rather to
        strike terror into the adversaries of Israel, than to invite them to the
        participation of one common joy. I take it, therefore, from Psalm
        67:3,4.’ But this is a very unsafe and presumptuous mode of reasoning.
        We must rest on Paul’s authority, rather than on the authority of
        Calvin, as to what was the intention of Moses in the passage quoted.
        Though Moses intended to strike terror into the enemies of Israel, there
        is no reason why Gentile believers should be terrified with this, or
        should not rejoice with the Jewish people of God in the victories of the
        Messiah over His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The perfect applicability of the quotation is clearly obvious. Besides,
        the passage alleged by Calvin as the quotation, namely, Psalm 67:3,4,
        cannot without violence be made to correspond with the words of Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why desert a passage where the words are easily found, and have recourse
        to a passage where the words are not found? Is this to be done on the
        strength of our own views of the words of Moses? Surely we ought
        implicitly to bow to the authority of Paul as a commentator on Moses. In
        fact, the quotation is as applicable to the Gentiles as to the Jews. In
        the typical sense of the passage, are not the Gentiles as much
        interested in the extension of salvation to the nations as the Jews? Are
        they not much more so? Is it not to them a matter of much greater joy?
        The Jews ought, indeed, to rejoice in the glory of God and the happiness
        of men in the extension of the Gospel. But the Gentiles, in addition to
        this, rejoice in it as their own salvation. Even in the literal sense,
        as applicable to the victories of Israel over their enemies, ought not
        believing Gentiles to have rejoiced in them?
      </p>
      <p>
        Did not Rahab rejoice in the victories of Israel over their enemies?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laud Him,
        all ye people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This quotation is from <19B701> Psalm 117:1. It calls upon all the
        nations to praise God. This implies that salvation was to extend to all
        nations, for none can praise God without the knowledge of God. Such
        addresses to the Gentiles are very numerous in the Book of Psalm, and
        refute the opinion of those who think it wrong to call on sinners to
        praise God. It is true that none but believers can praise God. But
        sinners may be called on to perform every duty incumbent on men, and
        charged with guilt for neglecting it. They ought to praise God. But this
        praise ought to be in faith, as well as every other duty. To suppose
        that sinners are not bound to praise God, is to suppose that their
        neglect of this and any other duty is not criminal. There is no danger
        in calling on sinners to observe the whole law of God, if it be also
        kept in view that no obedience in any degree can be given to God except
        through faith in His Son. This is quite a different thing from making
        prayer and praise a preparatory process to conversion. ‘The original
        word,’ says Dr. Macknight, ‘signifies to praise by singing,’ Luke 2:13.
        This is unsound criticism, and proceeds on a false canon, namely, that a
        word designates everything to which it is applicable. Words may apply to
        many things which are not designed by them. This word applies to praise
        by signing, but it does not express singing, because it also applies to
        praise in any manner.

        Ver. 12. — And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
        He that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in Him shall the Gentiles
        trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        And again, Esaias saith. — The Apostle has in this place given
        multiplied quotations from the Old Testament to prove the point in hand.
        One proof from Scripture, if applicable, is sufficient to prove
        anything, yet the Apostle gives us many. This shows that Divine truth
        ought to be exhibited to gainsayers in all its strength, with a display
        of all its evidence. In proportion as prejudice is opposed to any truth,
        it is necessary to fortify it with multiplied evidence. The Jews were
        greatly prejudiced against that part of the will of God which the
        Apostle now teaches, and he heaps scripture upon scripture to overcome
        their prejudices, although his own authority and his own declaration
        were as valid as those of the inspired writers whom he quoted. There
        shall be a root of Jesse. — Rather, there shall be the root of Jesse. It
        is a definite allusion to one particular person of the family of Jesse.
        Christ is called a branch in the same chapter, Isaiah 11; but He appears
        here to be called the root, or a particular shoot from the root, as He
        is elsewhere called a root out of a dry ground. This limits the origin
        of the human nature of the Messiah to the family of Jesse. And He that
        shall rise to reign over the Gentiles. — This determines the Messiah to
        be the King of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews. The passage quoted
        speaks of Him as a banner to the Gentiles. This the Apostle interprets
        as a rule r; because soldiers follow the banner of their captain. In Him
        shall the Gentiles trust. — This strictly asserts that the Gentiles
        would trust in the Messiah descended from Jesse.

        Ver. 13. — Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
        believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy
        Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the God of hope. — God is called the God of hope, because He is the
        author of all the well-grounded hope of His people. All hope of which He
        is not the author, in the heart of men, is false and delusive. The world
        in general may have hope, but it is false hope. All true hope with
        respect to the Divine favor is effected in the human heart by God
        Himself. Not only is God the author of all true hope, but He can create
        this hope out of the midst of despair. The most desponding are often
        raised by Him to a good hope through grace; and the most guilty are in a
        moment relieved, and made to hope in His mercy. How remarkably was this
        the case with the thief on the cross, and with the three thousand on the
        day of Pentecost! Fill you with all joy and peace. — The inward joy and
        peace of the Christian are the gifts of God, and not the natural effects
        of anything in the mind of man. All the promises and declarations of
        Scripture would fail in producing joy and peace in the mind of a sinner,
        were it not for the agency of the Spirit of God. If the Christian
        possesses joy and peace, he ought to ascribe it altogether to God. He
        ought to reflect that these blessings must be produced and continually
        maintained by Divine power, and not by any power of his own mind. It
        should always be kept in view that these fruits of the Spirit, first of
        joy, and next of peace, Galatians 5:22, cannot be produced except in
        connection with the other fruits of the Spirit, and in the way of
        obedience, and in carefully abstaining from grieving the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        David, when he had sinned, having lost his joy in God, utters this
        prayer: ‘Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with
        Thy free Spirit: then will I teach transgressors Thy ways’ Psalm 51:12.
        Here we may also observe that they who seek to teach transgressors the
        ways of God should first themselves have the experience of these ways.
        Fill you. — This implies that there are degrees of joy and peace in the
        minds of Christians. Some may have a measure of these graces who do not
        abound in them. It is a great blessing to be filled with them; and for
        this blessing the Apostle prays with respect to the Christians at Rome.
        If there be different degrees of joy and peace, how important is it to
        look earnestly to God for the fullest communication of these blessings!
        The Psalmist had more joy in his heart, bestowed by God, than worldly
        men have when their corn and wine most abound. In believing glory and
        peace, as well as all other spiritual blessings, are communicated by God
        through faith, and through faith only, and in proportion to faith.
        Faith, when spoken of without peculiar reference, means faith in Christ,
        and not, as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight understands it, faith in any particular promise.. That ye may
        abound in hope. — The above blessings the Apostle prayed for to be
        bestowed on those whom he addressed, in order that they might abound in
        hope; and the more believers are filled with joy and peace the greater
        will be their hope. The people of God have high hopes, and it is their
        privilege to seek from their Lord an increase and abundance of hope —
        not that faint and common hope of possibility or probability but a
        certain hope. Such a hope springs from faith, — in effect, is one with
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith rests upon the goodness and truth of Him who hath promised; and
        hope, raising itself upon faith so established, stands up and looks out
        to the future accomplishment of the promise. Through the power of the
        Holy Ghost. — Hope is produced in the mind by the agency and power of
        the Spirit of God. Here two persons of the Godhead are brought into view
        as each being the bestower of this gift. The Father gives hope — He is
        the God of hope; but He gives it through the Holy Ghost. In the economy
        of redemption, this is the province of the Holy Ghost. Hope is natural
        to the mind of man; and, in general, men have hope in the worst of
        times. But as to Divine things, hope is not natural to man: it is the
        fruit of the Spirit of God through faith in His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prayer contained in this verse reminds us that there is no blessing
        which does not come to us from God, James 1:17. He is called the God of
        love, of peace, of patience, of consolation, of hope, who fills His
        people with joy and peace. If, then, we desire to be filled with joy and
        peace, we must look to God. If we desire to abound in hope by the power
        of the Holy Ghost, we must with confidence pray to obtain His sacred
        influences and Divine teaching. We must be careful not to grieve Him by
        our evil conduct and evil desires.

      <p>
        Ver. 14. — And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
        also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to
        admonish one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren. — The Apostle here
        intimates that the reason of his writing to the believers as he had done
        was, not that he considered them deficient in the Christian character,
        or uninstructed in the doctrines and duties of their profession; on the
        contrary, even he himself was persuaded concerning them that they were
        full of goodness. Mr. Stuart confines this to kindness. There is no
        reason why it should not be extended to goodness in general, of which
        kindness is a part. As we ought continually and prominently to maintain
        that there is naturally nothing good in men, we ought likewise to give
        equal prominence to the fact that all believers, being born of God and
        made new creatures, work the works of God, and in their minds possess
        those dispositions which are produced by the Spirit through the truth.
        In our flesh there is nothing good; but from the work of the Spirit on
        our hearts we may be full of goodness. The honor of this redounds to God
        as much as that of our faith. If faith is the gift of God, so ‘we are
        His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,’ to the praise
        of the glory of God. Filled with all knowledge. — Paul acknowledges that
        those to whom he wrote excelled in the knowledge of Divine things,
        though he wrote to them with respect both to truth and duty. The
        commendations bestowed by the Apostle on the attainments of this church
        show that there are comparative degrees in the knowledge of the Lord’s
        people, and also that it is proper, on fit occasions, to confer
        approbation and praise on those who excel in knowledge. It is mere
        worldly wisdom, not countenanced by Scripture doctrine and example, to
        withhold commendation when due, lest it should serve to puff up. Able
        also to admonish one another. — The word in the original signifies to
        put in mind of duty, especially when it is transgressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle undertook to admonish them; but this did not imply that he
        considered them as unfit to admonish one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto
        you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is
        given to me of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless. — Though the Roman Christians were eminent in their
        attainments, yet the Apostle thought it necessary to write to them as he
        had done with respect to some things, as to which he trusted they were
        previously acquainted. Such things he judged it right to bring again to
        their remembrance. It is proper, then, in the pastors of a church to
        bring forward the truths and duties with which the brethren are already
        acquainted, as well as those with respect to which they may either be
        ignorant or deficient in knowledge. Because of the grace that is given
        to me of God. — This was the ground of his boldness. He spoke as an
        Apostle, and in all things advanced by him he was only the mouth of the
        Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the
        Gentiles, ministering the Gospel of God, that the offering up of the
        Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ. — The grace of the
        apostleship was given to Paul in order to his being a minister of Christ
        to the Gentiles. Ministering the Gospel of God — The original word for
        ministry signifies to labor in a sacred office. Our term ministry
        sufficiently represents it. Calvin blames Erasmus for at first
        translating it in this way, and prefers to translate it ‘consecrating
        the Gospel.’ But this is evidently an improper translation, for Paul did
        not consecrate the Gospel. The Gospel is God’s word, and needs no
        consecration. Erasmus afterwards translated it, ‘sacrificing the
        Gospel,’ which is still worse. It is not the Gospel which is here
        represented as a figurative sacrifice, but the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behaviors are a sacrifice presented by the Apostle to God through the
        Gospel. The Gospel is the means by which the Gentiles are made a
        sacrifice. Mr. Stuart translates it, ‘performing the office of a priest
        in respect to the Gospel of God.’ But this is liable to the same
        objection. It is not in respect to the Gospel that Paul considers
        himself figuratively a priest. It is with respect to the sacrifice,
        namely, the believing Gentiles, who are fitted for presentation as a
        sacrifice by the Gospel. That the offering up of the Gentiles. — The
        Gentiles are the thing presented to God in this sacrifice. This, it is
        obvious, is a sacrifice only figuratively, just as prayer and praise are
        called sacrifices. There is now no sacrifice in the proper sense of the
        word, and the Apostles were not priests, except as all believers are
        priests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the errors of the Man of Sin arise from considering teachers
        under the New Testament as successors of the priests under the law. But
        there is now no priesthood, except in Christ, who abides a Priest for
        ever after the order of Melchisedec. The priests under the law of Moses
        were His types. As He is come, and has engrossed the whole duties of the
        office to Himself, He alone possesses priesthood. There is no longer any
        need of a typical priesthood; and the great sacrifice has been already
        offered. When the Apostles are spoken of as doing any part of the
        priest’s office, it is in a figurative sense. It is in the same sense
        that the altar is spoken of. As there is no sacrifice now to be offered,
        there is now no altar. To give the Lord’s table the name of an altar is
        very erroneous. It is wonderful to consider how, from the figurative use
        of a few words in the New Testament and in early Church history, a
        number of the grossest and most superstitious doctrines and practices,
        as has been already observed, arose in the Church. The bread of the
        Lord’s table at length became the body of Christ in a literal sense; the
        table on which it lay became the altar; the teachers became the priests
        who offered the sacrifice of the mass; and the contributions of
        Christians became offerings. In all these things, and innumerable
        others, the figurative sense has been, by a gross imagination and the
        artifice of Satan, turned into a literal sense, to the utter subversion
        of truth. Might be acceptable. — The Gentiles became an acceptable
        sacrifice to God only through the faith of the Gospel. It is only by the
        blood of Christ that sinners can be washed from sin, and only through
        faith in Christ that any sinner obtains an interest in Christ’s blood,
        and only through the Gospel that faith in Christ is produced. All those
        who attempt to come to God in any other way are unacceptable to Him.
        This cuts off the hope of all self-righteous persons, and of all
        unbelievers. It takes away, also, the foundation from the doctrine of
        those who teach that Christ may be the Savior of what they call pious
        heathens who have not heard of Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Apostle Paul, the offering of the Gentiles is
        acceptable only through the Gospel. Sanctified by the Holy Ghost. — As
        the sacrifices under the law were sanctified externally and typically,
        this figurative sacrifice is sanctified truly by the Holy Ghost. No
        person, then, can be acceptable to God who is not sanctified by His
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
        those things which pertain to God. l have therefore whereof I may glory.
        — Paul says on another occasion, ‘God forbid that I should glory, save
        in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.’ Is it not a contradiction, then,
        to say here, ‘I have whereof I may glory?’ There is no contradiction:
        The glorying which he disclaims respects his acceptance with God. The
        glorying which he here acknowledges respects his success in the
        preaching of the Gospel; and even this is not a glorying in himself, but
        a glorying in Christ Jesus. It was the signal favor of his Lord that
        gave him his office of apostleship, qualified him for its discharge, and
        made him successful. From all the Apostle’s writings, we learn that of
        this he had the most firm conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives thanks to the Lord, who had counted him faithful, putting him
        into the ministry. But elsewhere he declares that he had ‘obtained mercy
        of the Lord to be faithful.’ In like manner all that he did in His
        service is ascribed to God. ‘Whereunto I also labor, striving according
        to His working, which worketh in me mightily.’ He had whereof to glory
        in the abundant and unmerited favor of God; but he always carefully
        avoids speaking of anything done by him that was not the work of Christ.
        In things that pertain to God. — That is, things that respect the
        service of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
        Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word
        and deed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For I will not dare. — Paul would not take to himself any portion of
        praise on account of the labors and success of others. He spoke only of
        the success which Christ had given him in his own work. This shows that
        although all success is of God, yet that it is an honor and a ground of
        praise to be successful in Christ’s work. Many have supposed that it is
        wrong to give any praise to the Lord’s servants on account of their
        labors, diligence, and success in His service. They have judged that
        this encourages a spirit of self-righteousness and of pride. But this
        wisdom is not from God. It is human wisdom, and tends to damp exertion
        in the service of Jesus Christ. All our success is in Christ Jesus, as
        well as our ability and disposition to labor. Yet God has given praise
        to His servants for their diligence and success in His work. It is a
        sinful refinement to blame what God approves. The Apostle speaks here of
        what Christ wrought by him. In other places he also speaks of what God
        wrought by him, Acts 14:27, 15:12. To make the Gentiles obedient. — The
        obedience of the Gentiles is their belief of the Gospel. To obey the
        Gospel is to receive it, for it commands belief. Now this obedience of
        the Gentiles to the Gospel was Christ’s work. Christ wrought it. — Faith
        is the gift of God. It is not to be ascribed either to him that preaches
        or to him that hears, but to Christ, who by His Spirit opens the heart
        to believe the truth. But the preacher is employed as an agent. Christ
        wrought this through the Apostle. No man is made a Christian by any
        power less than God’s, and by no other means than God’s word. Christ
        wrought the obedience of the Gentiles through Paul, but the
        instrumentality belongs to God’s word, as well as the agency to Himself.
        Some connect this with the word immediately preceding, and understand it
        of the profession and practice of the believing Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others understand it of the preaching, labors, and miracles of the
        Apostles. The next verse seems to determine for the latter sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — Through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit
        of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have
        fully preached the Gospel of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through mighty signs and wonders. — Rather through, or by the power of,
        signs and miracles. These are the deeds through which, as well as by
        Paul’s preaching, the Lord made the Gentiles obedient. This includes all
        the miraculous works of the Apostle for the confirmation of the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the power of the Spirit of God. — Some understand this of the power
        by which the signs and wonders were performed; others, of the gifts of
        the Holy Spirit, or the gift of tongues, prophecy, etc. The latter
        opinion appears to be the true meaning. So that from Jerusalem. — Some
        suppose that, as there is no mention in the Acts of the Apostles of
        Paul’s preaching in Illyricum, and as it is only said that he preached
        as far as Illyricum, he did not enter that country. But the silence of
        the Acts of the Apostles is no evidence of this, and verse 23rd seems to
        prove that he did preach in Illyricum, as well as in the intermediate
        countries between that province and Jerusalem. If there was no place in
        those parts for him to extend his labors on unoccupied ground, he must
        have preached in Illyricum also. Besides, that the Gospel had been
        preached, and that there were churches in Illyricum, appears from Titus
        going into Dalmatia. I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ, or
        fulfilled the Gospel. — The Gospel was to be preached to all nations. He
        filled all the countries with the glad tidings of salvation through
        Jesus Christ. Thus was it given to Paul, who was before a blasphemer,
        and a persecutor, and injurious, to preach the unsearchable riches of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel, not where Christ
        was named lest I should build upon another man’s foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel. — The word translated
        strived literally signifies to love honor; and as the love of honor
        stimulates to earnest exertions, the word came to signify, in a
        secondary sense, to endeavor earnestly, to strive. In this place,
        however, the primary sense appears to be that of the Apostle. He is
        speaking of the honor which God had conferred on him in the labor and
        success of the Gospel; and consistently with this, he speaks of his
        ambition to occupy ground that had not been taken possession of by
        others. This is not indeed worldly ambition, but it is ambition which is
        lawful and commendable in Christians. Not where Christ was Named — That
        is, in places that had not previously even heard of Christ. Similar
        ambition has often stimulated modern missionaries, and by their labors
        the Gospel has been carried to countries that were previously strangers
        to the very name of Christ. This appears to show that when any are
        strongly inclined to have the honor of being the means of subjecting new
        countries to the authority of Christ, they ought to endeavor to
        accomplish their desire. It is through this means that God excites men
        to fulfill His purposes of mercy to the different nations of the earth.
        Lest I should build upon another man’s foundation — This determines the
        meaning of the word translated to strive in this place. The Apostle was
        desirous of laying the foundation of the building in as many countries
        as possible. This is more honorable than to go into countries where
        others have been successful. Dr. Macknight understands this reason to
        indicate reluctance to perform the office of a subordinate teacher. But
        he evidently mistakes Paul’s meaning. To teach believers converted by
        others is not necessarily to perform the office of a subordinate
        teacher. With respect to those of the church at some itself, Paul was
        not the first who taught them; and he doubtless preached in many places
        where Christ had been named.
      </p>
      <p>
        This he did not avoid, though he was ambitious, as far as possible, to
        break up new ground, and have the honor of preaching to men who had not
        previously heard of Christ. Calvin well observes, ‘There is no
        foundation for perverting this passage by applying it to the pastoral
        office; for we know that the name of Christ must always continue to be
        preached in well-regulated and properly constituted churches, when the
        truth of the Gospel has been for a long period felt and acknowledged.’
        He that lays the foundation has more honor than he that builds on it in
        the Christian’s edification, but the latter is not without his reward.
        All cannot have the honor, and therefore have not the ambition, to go as
        missionaries to heathen countries. He that waters shall have his own
        reward, as well as he that plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — But as it is written, To whom He was not spoken of, they
        shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as it is written. — This ambition of the Apostle was the means of
        fulfilling a prophecy with respect to the spread of the Gospel in
        heathen countries. Thus it is that God fulfills His predictions and His
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives His people an earnest desire to be the means of accomplishing
        them at the moment when He designs their accomplishment. It will be thus
        that the Gospel will at last be effectually carried to every country
        under heaven. It is thus that modern missionaries have, in some measure,
        carried the Gospel to the heathen. And although the slothfulness of the
        people of God in former ages is not without blame, it is because the
        time to fulfill God’s predictions to the nations was not come, that a
        like ambition to that of Paul was not found more generally to animate
        Christians. Whenever the Lord has work to do, He raises up men with a
        heart to perform it. This, however, is no excuse at any particular time
        for indifference or want of effort to spread the Gospel. To whom He was
        not spoken of; Isaiah 52:15. — This intimates the preaching of the
        Gospel to the heathens, and it proves also that the Messiah was spoken
        of to the Jews. The law and the Prophets spoke of Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul’s ambition to carry the Gospel into countries where it had not been
        previously preached, had long prevented him from visiting Rome, where
        the Gospel had been preached by others. It is important to teach
        believers all things, whatsoever Jesus has commanded. But doubtless it
        is more important to convert sinners from the thralldom of Satan. The
        peculiar business of an Apostle and of missionaries is the latter, the
        former that of the pastor; though neither object is to be neglected by
        the one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
        great desire these many years to come unto you; But now having no more
        place in these parts. — Paul could not advance farther in that
        direction. This seems to prove, as already asserted, that the Apostle
        had preached in Illyricum as well as in the intermediate places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had he not done so, there would still have been place for him in these
        parts. When an opportunity of serving Christ in one direction is shut
        up, we ought to turn to another. When there is no opportunity of
        preaching Christ to those who have not heard of Him, we ought to occupy
        ourselves in laboring among those by whom he is already known. Paul
        diligently employed his time to the greatest advantage. He was always in
        some way occupied in the service of his Master. Having a great desire
        these many years to come unto you. — This shows that the Lord’s
        servants, with respect to the field of their labors, may lawfully be
        influenced by their desires. Paul was no doubt always sent by God to the
        place where He would have him to be; but sometimes He sent him not by
        direct command, but by his own desire or providential circumstances, or
        the persecution of his enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
        for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way
        thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat, filled with your company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you. — The
        commission of the Apostles extended to all countries, but they were not
        always immediately directed with respect to the scene of their labors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes they proposed what they were unable to accomplish. This no
        doubt was always overruled by God for the fulfillment of His own
        purposes, and His sending them to the places in which He designed them
        to labor. Sometimes, however, they were immediately directed, and either
        enjoined to go to a certain place, or restrained from going. The
        intention of Jesus in allowing them in general to direct their own
        course, while He overruled it in every instance, was no doubt for an
        example to us, that in directing our labors we are to judge according to
        our own views and desires, and that we are not to expect miraculous or
        immediate directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Missionaries sometimes err on this point, and seem to look for
        miraculous interposition to direct them in going or not going to certain
        places. This is what the Apostles themselves had not at all times, and
        which is by no means necessary. The Gospel is to be preached to every
        creature; and if nothing in God’s providence prevent our going according
        to our views and desires, yet we ought to look for the Divine direction.
        This, however, should be sought by prayer, through the influence of the
        Holy Spirit on our minds, and in the providence of God, and not through
        any immediate impression or supernatural communication. The providence
        of Jesus, whose is the command to preach the Gospel, and who directs the
        course of all things, will either open the door or shut it according as
        it suits His sovereign pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been made a question whether Paul was ever in Spain. On the one
        side, some argue that, from his inspiration in writing this passage, he
        must have gone to that country, and others, for want of evidence that he
        was in Spain, argue that in writing these words he was not inspired.
        Both these opinions are wrong. Paul’s inspiration in announcing his
        purposes does not imply the necessity of his always fulfilling these
        purposes. He had fully determined to visit Spain, and this the Holy
        Spirit inspired him to declare. But he did not pledge the Divine power
        to accomplish this resolution. It was useful to declare the resolution,
        whether it was to be accomplished or not. His inspiration, then, is no
        evidence of his having visited Spain. But much less is the want of
        evidence of his being in Spain a proof that he was not inspired; for if
        the inspiration of this passage necessarily imported that he must have
        been in Spain, want of positive information that he was there, so far
        from furnishing contrary evidence, is not even an objection. There are
        thousands of facts of which there are no records. Dr. Macknight, then,
        reasons without attending to first principles, when he says, ‘This,
        among other instances, is a proof that in speaking of what he meant to
        do afterwards, the Apostle did not make known any determinations of God
        revealed to him by the Spirit, but his own resolutions and opinions
        only. For there is no evidence that he ever went to Spain.’ The want of
        such evidence is no proof that he did not fulfill his purpose. The
        writer proceeds upon a false first principle, namely, that a prediction
        or declaration cannot be accounted as being really fulfilled unless
        there are records of its fulfillment. There are, indeed, other instances
        which show that Paul was sometimes disappointed in his expectations and
        purposes; but this is not such an instance. The only reason why we
        should hesitate in believing that Paul was in Spain is, that this is not
        necessarily required by the inspiration of the passage. It is possible
        that he might not be able to fulfill the purpose which he was inspired
        to declare. If the inspiration of the passage required that Paul must
        visit Spain, then we have the fullest warrant to believe that he was
        there. Tradition affirms that Paul was in Spain; but this is not
        evidence. For I trust to see you in my journey. — This shows that Paul’s
        resolution was his own, and that its fulfillment was a matter of
        uncertain hope, not of absolute prediction. He planned, it would appear,
        his visits in such a manner as not unnecessarily to consume time. He
        purposed to visit Rome on his way to Spain. And to be brought on my way
        thitherward by you. — The original word translated ‘to be brought on my
        way,’ signifies to conduct, escort, or send forward. In the latter
        sense, as implying the defraying all the expenses of the journey, the
        word seems to be used here, and on some other occasions in the New
        Testament. The Lord could have miraculously provided a supply for the
        Apostles while they preached the Gospel, or He could have commanded for
        this purpose the treasures of the Roman empire; but He chose to do this
        by the contributions of His people. Filled with your company. — This
        shows the great delight that the Apostle had in the society of
        believers. Ought not Christians to delight in meeting one another from
        the remotest parts of the earth? What a hindrance to the cultivation of
        this principle are the divisions of Christians into sects and parties!
        Somewhat filled. — By this the Apostle intimates that, though their
        society for a short time would be highly gratifying to him, yet his
        delight in it could never be satiated. This is true Christian love. An
        introduction to the emperor and the great men of his council would not
        have gratified the Apostle so much as the society of the despised
        believers in Rome. Nothing should separate the mutual affection of those
        who are united in Christ. If the ignorance of the most ignorant of them
        does not shut the bowels of Christ with respect to them, should it do so
        with us?
      </p>
      <p>We all know but in part.</p>
      <p>Ver. 25. — But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had proposed to visit Rome, the capital of the world, and to
        carry the Gospel into Spain, where it had not yet been preached. He had
        long been prevented from visiting the Roman Christians, and yet, instead
        of going thither now, he chooses to go to Jerusalem, carrying money for
        the relief of the poor. But was not the preaching of the Gospel a
        greater matter than serving tables? Could not others have been found to
        carry this money without burdening Paul? If Paul, in order to save time
        for the preaching of the Gospel, seldom baptized believers, why did he
        spend it in carrying this gift of the Gentiles to the Jewish brethren?
        The object must assuredly have been very important and doubtless it was
        that he might improve the opportunity of overcoming the prejudice of the
        Jews towards the Gentiles, by this evidence of their liberality and
        love. This would tend to knit the Jews and Gentiles more closely
        together. And it was for this purpose, no doubt, that the dearth was
        occasioned in Jerusalem. For a similar purpose, it appears that God, in
        all ages, places some of His people in circumstances where they require;
        to be assisted, while He renders others able to assist, because this
        mutually attaches them to each other, as well as tries them. We here
        also see that it is not merely to the wants of the brethren in the same
        church that His people should attend, but where it is necessary, they
        ought to contribute assistance to the wants of the brethren in the
        remotest parts of the earth. This contribution was sent from one quarter
        of the globe to another. Nothing can more clearly show the importance of
        this matter than that, in order to attend to it, Paul postponed the most
        important engagements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
        certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia. — Or, Macedonia and
        Achaia have been pleased, or have thought good. The words Macedonia and
        Achaia are here used for the brethren or churches of Macedonia and
        Achaia. The places are put for those who live in them. Not, however, all
        the inhabitants of those places, but the churches of Christ only. This
        shows that the Scriptures employ the same figurative language that is
        familiar to other writings. This phraseology also justifies the manner
        in which we speak of the Epistles of the Apostles — the Epistle to the
        Romans, to the Corinthians, etc. By this we do not mean that the
        Epistles were addressed to the inhabitants of those cities universally —
        as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight, with an ignorance of Scripture seldom exceeded, and of the
        character of the apostolic Epistles, has asserted in his note, ch. 1:7,
        respecting this Epistle — but to the believers who resided in them. It
        hath pleased. — This contribution was not absolutely prescribed to them
        by the Apostle, but was a free-will offering of their own. The support
        of the Lord’s poor is to proceed from the love of their brethren for
        Christ’s sake. To make a certain contribution. — It was a collection in
        which they shared individually. Each contributed his part. Poor saints,
        or the poor of the saints. The word saints is not only as proper a name
        of all the disciples of Christ as the word Christian itself, but it is
        one much more frequently used in the New Testament. Yet in after times
        the designation of Christian was extended to whole nations, while that
        of saints, as has been formerly remarked, was limited to a few escalated
        to that rank on account of supposititious piety, by the act of the Man
        of Sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 27. — It hath pleased them verily, and their debtors they are. For
        if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things,
        their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
      </p>
      <p>
        It hath pleased them verily. — Paul repeats this expression, in order to
        show the grounds on which he used it. They thought it good to act so,
        and good reason they had for it. It was, indeed, a matter of their own
        free will; yet it was one to which they were called by the voice of
        duty. They were debtors to the Jews for the Gospel. Not only did the
        kingdom of God first originate with the Jews, but it was through the
        instrumentality of Jews that the Gentiles received it. They carried it
        to their doors, and besought them to receive the blessing. From this we
        may learn the extent of the obligation, and the unity of the body of
        Christ. The services of any one of the Lord’s people lays those who
        receive them under obligations to the whole family to which they belong.
        If the Gentiles were under obligation to the Jewish brethren on account
        of being made partakers of the Gospel through their means, how much more
        are converts under obligation to those who are personally the means of
        their conversion. Spiritual things. — This phrase denotes the blessings
        of the Gospel, and communion with God, and everything that concerns the
        soul and body in their future state, as distinguished from those things
        that concern the wants of the body, and relate only to this world, which
        are called carnal things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — When, therefore, I have performed this and have sealed to
        them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. When, therefore, I have
        performed this. — That is, when I shall have finished what I have
        commenced as to the matter of the contribution. This would be when the
        poor of the saints at Jerusalem had received the gift of their brethren.
        And have sealed to them this fruit. — Several different interpretations
        are given of this; expression. The meaning appears to be this: fruit
        means fruit of the faith of the Gospel. The contribution of the Gentile
        churches was a fruit of their faith in Christ. As to the sealing of this
        fruit, it is to be remarked that a seal was used to stamp anything as
        genuine, and to distinguish it from a counterfeit. Now this fruit was a
        convincing evidence that their faith was real, and that the Gentiles had
        received the Gospel, not in name only, but in truth. The Apostle sealed
        this fruit, when he exhibited this evidence to the Jewish believers of
        the faith of their Gentile brethren. Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart, with
        others, understand this sealing as indicating the security, or making
        sure the contribution to those for whom it was destined. But this gives
        an unworthy view both of Paul and the Gentile churches. It represents
        him as personally undertaking the charge or conveyance of this
        contribution), in order that it might be more securely carried. But
        surely there were confidential persons in the churches who could have
        carried the money with as much security as the Apostle himself; and Paul
        would not indulge such an injurious jealousy with respect to the
        brethren. He had a higher object in conducting this mission of mercy to
        the Jewish brethren. By this means he would remove the doubts and disarm
        the jealousy of the Jews with respect to the Gentiles. No other object
        could be of sufficient importance to detain Paul from visiting Rome and
        Spain, but that paramount object of uniting the Jews and Gentiles. Union
        among Christians we here see even placed before the carrying of the
        Gospel to new countries. I will come by you into Spain. — What Paul had
        stated formerly as a matter of hope, he here states absolutely. An
        absolute statement, however, does not necessarily bind by promise, but
        is only a declaration of the full intention of the present moment. Men
        speak absolutely of their purposes when they are fully resolved to
        perform them. But sometimes these purposes it may not be possible to
        fulfill. A promise is a very different thing from an absolute
        declaration. Some persons act like mere caviling casuists in explaining
        duty with respect to this point. If a person once refuses the thing
        asked, it is looked on as a breach of truth if he afterwards yield. But
        there may be just reason to change his mind, and his absolute
        declaration in the negative was only the expression of his mind at the
        time of utterance. Some specialists have held that if a thing be matter
        of duty, gratitude is not due to the benefactor from him who receives
        the benefit, nor praise from others on account of it. This is false
        morality. To make this contribution was a duty as to the Gentiles, but
        it was the duty of the Jews to receive it with gratitude; and Paul, 2
        Corinthians 9:2, praises the performance. ‘I boast of you to them of
        Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago.’ Some persons would be
        afraid to bestow a word of commendation on the most disinterested
        Christian conduct; but the Apostle does not scruple to boast of the
        conduct of Christians. We may here also notice the condemnation of the
        false morality of some casuists.
      </p>
      <p>
        They hold it unscriptural, and contrary to the simplicity of the Gospel,
        to urge people to duty by any other motive than the love of God. But the
        Apostle urges forward the disciples by the zeal of other Christians. In
        fact, in Scripture, every motive belonging to human nature, as it is the
        work of God, is freely employed to urge to duty and deter from sin. The
        refinement which refuses any of the weapons that God has employed, is
        calculated not to promote but to injure the service of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 29. — And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
        fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I am sure. — Dr. Macknight limits this knowledge to the Apostle’s
        experience. But this limitation is improper. If he knew this, he could
        know it only from God. Fullness of the blessing of the Gospel — Paul was
        sure that God would give success to the Gospel, and that he would come
        in the fullness of this blessing — that is, with the richest measure of
        this success.
      </p>
      <p>
        This visit, then, would be fraught with the happiest results to the
        Romans.
      </p>
      <p>
        How ought Christian churches to go about all their affairs, and
        undertake all their work for the spreading of the kingdom and truth of
        Christ, with the most earnest prayers for this blessing! And all who
        preach the Gospel ought to look for this as essentially necessary to
        their success. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight expounds this, ‘I shall come empowered to bestow on you
        abundantly the gifts of the Spirit.’ This no doubt was included in the
        blessing, but it is far from exhausting it. Calvin’s view of the
        passage, which he mentions as the general one, cannot be approved. He
        prefers the interpretation that makes Paul express the conviction that
        he will find the Christians at Rome abounding in good works. The words
        have no appearance of expressing such a meaning. It is the Apostle
        himself who was to come in the fullness of this blessing. It is not said
        that when he should come he would find among them this blessing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 30. — Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake
        and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your
        prayers to God for me; Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus
        Christ’s sake. — To do everything for the sake of Christ, implies that
        the thing is agreeable to Christ. It must show love or obedience to Him.
        We could not be properly required to do anything for Christ’s sake which
        was contrary, or rather which we did not know to be agreeable, to the
        will of Christ. To pray for one another in our mutual difficulties, is a
        thing most pleasing and honorable to Christ. But when we are called upon
        for Christ’s sake to assist in the promotion or maintenance of
        superstition or false religion or in any way to support or countenance
        it, we ought to resist and not comply. The votaries of the Romish
        apostasy have the love of God or of Christ in their mouth continually
        when they call for assistance in their superstitious works. But the
        disciples of Christ ought to testify loudly against them, instead of
        bidding them God speed with their aid. For Christ’s sake implies also
        that those addressed are the people of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        They who are not such can do nothing for His sake. Love of the Spirit. —
        Some understand this of the love which the Spirit has for Christ’s
        people, and others of the love to one another which the Spirit works in
        them. The expression is capable in itself of either sense; and other
        considerations must determine the preference. Some unite both opinions,
        which is the most mischievous of all methods of interpretation, as it
        tends to encourage us in slothfulness with respect to the meaning of
        Scripture, and to a prostitution of Scripture as implying a sense which
        it does not truly bear. No passage unites two different senses at once.
        Yet those who, in interpreting Scripture, attach to it only one meaning,
        when, according to the best of their judgment, it is the true one, are
        often loudly accused of dogmatism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The love of God may be either God’s love to us, or our love to God; and
        accordingly, in Scripture, it is sometimes used in the one sense, and
        sometimes in the other. But it never at the same time signifies both. It
        is always the connection and other circumstances that must determine the
        meaning. The love of the Spirit here is most probably the love which the
        Spirit works in His people, which disposes them to love one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, from this principle of pure love, Paul entreats their prayers for
        himself. Love is not the fruit of the natural heart of man. Men are by
        nature hateful and hating one another. When sinners believe in Christ,
        the Holy Spirit produces in their hearts love to one another. This
        phrase, also, whether it refers to the love which the Spirit produces in
        believers, or which He has for them, clearly implies His Godhead. That
        ye strive together with me in your prayers. — The word here employed
        signifies the strongest exertion, alluding to the struggle of wrestlers
        in the games. Prayer, then, is not a formal exercise. This shows the
        great importance at all times, to the Lord’s people, of an ardent spirit
        of prayer. It is through prayer that the Lord is usually pleased to
        bestow His favors. He requires to be asked, and asked repeatedly and
        earnestly, for the things which He has promised to bestow. ‘Thus saith
        the Lord God,’ — in promising to confer the greatest blessings, — ’I
        will yet for this be inquired of by the house Of Israel to do it for
        them,’ Ezekiel 36:37. To God, namely, the Father. — This verse refers to
        the whole Godhead — the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and here
        the distinct personality of the Holy Ghost, His power and influence, are
        referred to, as in verses 13, 16, and 19. For me. — This shows the
        propriety and importance of prayer for one another. Even the Apostle
        Paul, with all his distinguishing privileges, deems it a matter of the
        greatest importance to himself. If Paul needed the prayers of his
        brethren, who were so far behind him, can they be unimportant to
        Christ’s people in general?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 31. — That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in
        Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of
        the saints; That I may be delivered. — What was the thing for which the
        Apostle requested the prayers of his fellow-Christians? It was to be
        delivered from death and danger in the discharge of his work. This shows
        that, how willing so ever we ought to be to sacrifice our lives for
        Christ’s sake, yet that, as far as possible, we ought to desire to
        preserve life. The Apostle is not ashamed to call on his brethren to
        unite in the most fervent supplications for his preservation from death,
        and from the hand of his enemies. How different is this from the
        language of Ignatius, who seemed rather to call for the prayers of his
        brethren that he might be honored with a crown of martyrdom, than to be
        preserved from his enemies. Christians ought to be willing to give their
        lives for Christ rather than deny Him or refuse to do any part of His
        known will. But it is not only lawful but dutiful to take every proper
        means for their deliverance out of danger. If even an Apostle, in the
        cause of Christ, was so desirous of preserving life, what shall we think
        of those who profess a spirit of indifference respecting it, which would
        wantonly throw it away? Them that do not believe in Judea. — Paul knew
        the danger of the visit to his countrymen. He was in greater danger in
        Jerusalem than in any of the most barbarous heathen countries; yet he
        did not decline his duty. This is true Christian courage. We ought to
        take every precaution to preserve our lives, but we ought not to decline
        duty to save them. We should go forward, and look to God to deliver us
        out of the hand of them who do not believe. Those who reject the Gospel
        will always be its enemies, and from such, therefore, the Apostle prays
        to be delivered. The Gospel declares not only salvation to those who
        believe, but damnation to all who reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It must then be an object of hatred to all who do not believe. And it is
        remarkable that, while the most debasing superstitious are looked upon
        with indifference by the wise men of the world, the coolest and most
        philosophic of their number kindle into wrath against the Gospel. If,
        then, the Apostle foresaw the danger of this visit to Jerusalem, and if
        he so strongly desired to be delivered from it, his object of visiting
        his countrymen must have been exceedingly important. My service. — Paul
        was in the highest dignity of the Church of Christ on earth, yet he
        willingly undertook an office of the most dangerous service for the
        supply of the temporal wants of his brethren. For Jerusalem. — This is
        another instance of figurative language employed by inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jerusalem is put for the saints in Jerusalem — the city for the
        inhabitants, and not all the inhabitants, but certain inhabitants well
        known to the reader. May be accepted. — This seems at first sight very
        strange What fear could there be that the supply of the wants of the
        distressed would not be acceptable to them? Yet Paul makes it a matter
        of the most earnest prayer for himself and his brethren to whom he
        writes, that the saints at Jerusalem might be disposed to receive the
        gift cordially. This, beyond all contradiction, shows how averse the
        Jews were to the Gentiles, and the reason why the Apostle urged this
        collection so strongly, and conducted the mission in his own person. Why
        shall we now expect perfection in knowledge or attainments among the
        people of God? In the apostolic churches we indeed see none recognized
        as members but such as were judged to be believers, but they were
        believers with every degree of weakness, both in knowledge and in
        character. Calvin understands Paul’s doubts with respect to the
        acceptableness of the gift of the Gentiles, to have reference to
        prejudice against himself on the part of the believing Jews. But this
        has no just foundation; and, had this been the fear, the danger could
        have been easily prevented without exposing Paul to the persecution of
        the unbelievers. Could not Paul have sent the money by the hands of
        others? This would have guarded against the supposed prejudice of the
        brethren in Jerusalem, and have prevented the danger of death with
        respect to Paul from the hands of unbelieving Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 32. — That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may
        with you be refreshed.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I may come unto you with joy. — Dr. Macknight, as well as Calvin,
        understands this as the result of the prayer, and not as one of the
        things prayed for. The result of the acceptable reception of the gift
        would be Paul’s joyful visit to Rome. But, most evidently, the words
        referred to are not the supposed result of the prayer, but are a part of
        the prayer itself, along with the other things before mentioned. The
        Apostle besought them not only to pray that the saints at Jerusalem
        might accept the gift, but, in addition to this, they were desired to
        pray that he might, after delivering the gift, come to them with joy. It
        would no doubt be a matter of joy for the Apostle that the gift of which
        he was the bearer might be well received.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it is not to this solely that he refers, but to joy in general. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight seems to be greatly mistaken when he says, ‘How much the
        Apostle was disappointed in his generous design, and in what
        disadvantageous circumstances he came to Rome, the history of the Acts
        informs us.’ There is every reason to believe that the gift was well
        received. He was indeed disappointed with respect to the manner of his
        coming to Rome, but he might not be disappointed in his joy when he
        arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we may learn that if even on God’s errand we have need of
        prayer for success in our journey, how much more do we need prayer in
        our own daily business! So much does God encourage the exercise of
        prayer, that He wills us to pray for success when we do His own work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole passage also, is the strongest refutation of the theory of
        those who suppose that prayer is useless, because of the unchangeable
        purposes of God. The express command of the Spirit of inspiration
        annihilates all the subtle speculations of men on this subject. We here
        see that it is not only lawful and proper to pray to the unchangeable
        God, but that it is our duty to pray to Him to prosper us even in His
        own work. How unlike is God’s book to human wisdom! — on every page
        there shines the evidence of its Divine origin. By the will of God. —
        This shows us that all events depend on God’s will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing happens without His appointment. All the efforts of his enemies,
        as well as all the exertions of His servants, only fulfill His
        irresistible purposes. Without His will, nothing takes place on earth
        more than in heaven. God not only permits everything that takes place on
        earth, as some are inclined in this way to soften down His sovereignty,
        but He wills and appoints it. Calvin well observes on this passage ‘The
        sentence, By the will of God, instructs us in the necessity of devoting
        ourselves to prayer, since God alone directs all our paths and all our
        steps by his gracious and unerring providence.’ And may with you be
        refreshed. — The word literally signifies to recline together in order
        to mutual rest, and, in a secondary sense, to be refreshed together
        after fatigue. Here it beautifully expresses that mutual comfort and
        refreshment which believers, amidst their toils, and dangers, and
        troubles in the world, enjoy in speaking together of the things of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reflect on the word of God gives great refreshment, but to reflect on
        this in company with other Christians is the most heavenly exercise. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight confines the refreshment to the subject of the reconciliation
        of the Jews with the Gentiles. But it refers to every consolation that
        might be the object of their conversation about the things of Christ.
        From this we see that the Apostle had, like other believers, the same
        need of refreshment from reflection on the word of God, and from
        intercourse with the brethren. Paul is not ashamed to speak of the
        refreshment which he expected from the company of the Roman Christians,
        as well as of that which they should receive from his company.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 33. — Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>
      <p>
        Now the God of peace be with you all. — In this manner the Apostle
        concludes this part of his Epistle to the believers at Rome, wishing
        them the presence and the blessing of the God of peace. This expression
        is used only by Paul in his Epistles, in which he employs it frequently.
        Peace, in scripture, signifies generally all kinds of good and
        prosperity; as it is said, Isaiah 45:7, ‘I form the light, and create
        darkness: I make peace, and create evil.’ To say, then, that God is the
        God of peace, is to say that He is the author of every blessing. The
        Spirit of God calls the good state of the conscience of the believer
        peace and prosperity, whatever may be his case regarding things
        external. His peace Jesus promised to His disciples: ‘Peace I leave with
        you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto
        you.’ But peace may be taken particularly for the love through which God
        has reconciled His people to Himself by Jesus Christ, thus expressing
        the goodness of God revealed in the Gospel In the Old Testament, God is
        called the Lord of Hosts; but in the New Testament, having made peace by
        the blood of the cross of His Son, He is pleased to call Himself the God
        of peace. It is this peace which the angel, with the heavenly host,
        celebrated in saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
        good will toward men.’ The Apostles usually express this in their
        salutations, saying, ‘Grace and peace be with you, from God our Father
        and the Lord Jesus Christ,’ uniformly, however, placing grace first,
        without which they could not have peace. Paul, in here employing this
        title, the God of peace, indicates the free access which His people have
        to God, and the assurance that their petitions shall be heard; for what
        shall they not obtain from Him who has laid aside all His wrath, and
        breathes towards them only grace and peace? We see, then, the efficacy
        of the peace of God, and what consolation believers should experience,
        and what confidence towards God in their prayers, when they consider
        that God is the God of peace.
