      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul’s ambition to carry the Gospel into countries where it had not been
        previously preached, had long prevented him from visiting Rome, where
        the Gospel had been preached by others. It is important to teach
        believers all things, whatsoever Jesus has commanded. But doubtless it
        is more important to convert sinners from the thralldom of Satan. The
        peculiar business of an Apostle and of missionaries is the latter, the
        former that of the pastor; though neither object is to be neglected by
        the one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
        great desire these many years to come unto you; But now having no more
        place in these parts. — Paul could not advance farther in that
        direction. This seems to prove, as already asserted, that the Apostle
        had preached in Illyricum as well as in the intermediate places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had he not done so, there would still have been place for him in these
        parts. When an opportunity of serving Christ in one direction is shut
        up, we ought to turn to another. When there is no opportunity of
        preaching Christ to those who have not heard of Him, we ought to occupy
        ourselves in laboring among those by whom he is already known. Paul
        diligently employed his time to the greatest advantage. He was always in
        some way occupied in the service of his Master. Having a great desire
        these many years to come unto you. — This shows that the Lord’s
        servants, with respect to the field of their labors, may lawfully be
        influenced by their desires. Paul was no doubt always sent by God to the
        place where He would have him to be; but sometimes He sent him not by
        direct command, but by his own desire or providential circumstances, or
        the persecution of his enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
        for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way
        thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat, filled with your company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you. — The
        commission of the Apostles extended to all countries, but they were not
        always immediately directed with respect to the scene of their labors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes they proposed what they were unable to accomplish. This no
        doubt was always overruled by God for the fulfillment of His own
        purposes, and His sending them to the places in which He designed them
        to labor. Sometimes, however, they were immediately directed, and either
        enjoined to go to a certain place, or restrained from going. The
        intention of Jesus in allowing them in general to direct their own
        course, while He overruled it in every instance, was no doubt for an
        example to us, that in directing our labors we are to judge according to
        our own views and desires, and that we are not to expect miraculous or
        immediate directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Missionaries sometimes err on this point, and seem to look for
        miraculous interposition to direct them in going or not going to certain
        places. This is what the Apostles themselves had not at all times, and
        which is by no means necessary. The Gospel is to be preached to every
        creature; and if nothing in God’s providence prevent our going according
        to our views and desires, yet we ought to look for the Divine direction.
        This, however, should be sought by prayer, through the influence of the
        Holy Spirit on our minds, and in the providence of God, and not through
        any immediate impression or supernatural communication. The providence
        of Jesus, whose is the command to preach the Gospel, and who directs the
        course of all things, will either open the door or shut it according as
        it suits His sovereign pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been made a question whether Paul was ever in Spain. On the one
        side, some argue that, from his inspiration in writing this passage, he
        must have gone to that country, and others, for want of evidence that he
        was in Spain, argue that in writing these words he was not inspired.
        Both these opinions are wrong. Paul’s inspiration in announcing his
        purposes does not imply the necessity of his always fulfilling these
        purposes. He had fully determined to visit Spain, and this the Holy
        Spirit inspired him to declare. But he did not pledge the Divine power
        to accomplish this resolution. It was useful to declare the resolution,
        whether it was to be accomplished or not. His inspiration, then, is no
        evidence of his having visited Spain. But much less is the want of
        evidence of his being in Spain a proof that he was not inspired; for if
        the inspiration of this passage necessarily imported that he must have
        been in Spain, want of positive information that he was there, so far
        from furnishing contrary evidence, is not even an objection. There are
        thousands of facts of which there are no records. Dr. Macknight, then,
        reasons without attending to first principles, when he says, ‘This,
        among other instances, is a proof that in speaking of what he meant to
        do afterwards, the Apostle did not make known any determinations of God
        revealed to him by the Spirit, but his own resolutions and opinions
        only. For there is no evidence that he ever went to Spain.’ The want of
        such evidence is no proof that he did not fulfill his purpose. The
        writer proceeds upon a false first principle, namely, that a prediction
        or declaration cannot be accounted as being really fulfilled unless
        there are records of its fulfillment. There are, indeed, other instances
        which show that Paul was sometimes disappointed in his expectations and
        purposes; but this is not such an instance. The only reason why we
        should hesitate in believing that Paul was in Spain is, that this is not
        necessarily required by the inspiration of the passage. It is possible
        that he might not be able to fulfill the purpose which he was inspired
        to declare. If the inspiration of the passage required that Paul must
        visit Spain, then we have the fullest warrant to believe that he was
        there. Tradition affirms that Paul was in Spain; but this is not
        evidence. For I trust to see you in my journey. — This shows that Paul’s
        resolution was his own, and that its fulfillment was a matter of
        uncertain hope, not of absolute prediction. He planned, it would appear,
        his visits in such a manner as not unnecessarily to consume time. He
        purposed to visit Rome on his way to Spain. And to be brought on my way
        thitherward by you. — The original word translated ‘to be brought on my
        way,’ signifies to conduct, escort, or send forward. In the latter
        sense, as implying the defraying all the expenses of the journey, the
        word seems to be used here, and on some other occasions in the New
        Testament. The Lord could have miraculously provided a supply for the
        Apostles while they preached the Gospel, or He could have commanded for
        this purpose the treasures of the Roman empire; but He chose to do this
        by the contributions of His people. Filled with your company. — This
        shows the great delight that the Apostle had in the society of
        believers. Ought not Christians to delight in meeting one another from
        the remotest parts of the earth? What a hindrance to the cultivation of
        this principle are the divisions of Christians into sects and parties!
        Somewhat filled. — By this the Apostle intimates that, though their
        society for a short time would be highly gratifying to him, yet his
        delight in it could never be satiated. This is true Christian love. An
        introduction to the emperor and the great men of his council would not
        have gratified the Apostle so much as the society of the despised
        believers in Rome. Nothing should separate the mutual affection of those
        who are united in Christ. If the ignorance of the most ignorant of them
        does not shut the bowels of Christ with respect to them, should it do so
        with us?
      </p>
      <p>We all know but in part.</p>
      <p>Ver. 25. — But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had proposed to visit Rome, the capital of the world, and to
        carry the Gospel into Spain, where it had not yet been preached. He had
        long been prevented from visiting the Roman Christians, and yet, instead
        of going thither now, he chooses to go to Jerusalem, carrying money for
        the relief of the poor. But was not the preaching of the Gospel a
        greater matter than serving tables? Could not others have been found to
        carry this money without burdening Paul? If Paul, in order to save time
        for the preaching of the Gospel, seldom baptized believers, why did he
        spend it in carrying this gift of the Gentiles to the Jewish brethren?
        The object must assuredly have been very important and doubtless it was
        that he might improve the opportunity of overcoming the prejudice of the
        Jews towards the Gentiles, by this evidence of their liberality and
        love. This would tend to knit the Jews and Gentiles more closely
        together. And it was for this purpose, no doubt, that the dearth was
        occasioned in Jerusalem. For a similar purpose, it appears that God, in
        all ages, places some of His people in circumstances where they require;
        to be assisted, while He renders others able to assist, because this
        mutually attaches them to each other, as well as tries them. We here
        also see that it is not merely to the wants of the brethren in the same
        church that His people should attend, but where it is necessary, they
        ought to contribute assistance to the wants of the brethren in the
        remotest parts of the earth. This contribution was sent from one quarter
        of the globe to another. Nothing can more clearly show the importance of
        this matter than that, in order to attend to it, Paul postponed the most
        important engagements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
        certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia. — Or, Macedonia and
        Achaia have been pleased, or have thought good. The words Macedonia and
        Achaia are here used for the brethren or churches of Macedonia and
        Achaia. The places are put for those who live in them. Not, however, all
        the inhabitants of those places, but the churches of Christ only. This
        shows that the Scriptures employ the same figurative language that is
        familiar to other writings. This phraseology also justifies the manner
        in which we speak of the Epistles of the Apostles — the Epistle to the
        Romans, to the Corinthians, etc. By this we do not mean that the
        Epistles were addressed to the inhabitants of those cities universally —
        as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight, with an ignorance of Scripture seldom exceeded, and of the
        character of the apostolic Epistles, has asserted in his note, ch. 1:7,
        respecting this Epistle — but to the believers who resided in them. It
        hath pleased. — This contribution was not absolutely prescribed to them
        by the Apostle, but was a free-will offering of their own. The support
        of the Lord’s poor is to proceed from the love of their brethren for
        Christ’s sake. To make a certain contribution. — It was a collection in
        which they shared individually. Each contributed his part. Poor saints,
        or the poor of the saints. The word saints is not only as proper a name
        of all the disciples of Christ as the word Christian itself, but it is
        one much more frequently used in the New Testament. Yet in after times
        the designation of Christian was extended to whole nations, while that
        of saints, as has been formerly remarked, was limited to a few escalated
        to that rank on account of supposititious piety, by the act of the Man
        of Sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 27. — It hath pleased them verily, and their debtors they are. For
        if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things,
        their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
      </p>
      <p>
        It hath pleased them verily. — Paul repeats this expression, in order to
        show the grounds on which he used it. They thought it good to act so,
        and good reason they had for it. It was, indeed, a matter of their own
        free will; yet it was one to which they were called by the voice of
        duty. They were debtors to the Jews for the Gospel. Not only did the
        kingdom of God first originate with the Jews, but it was through the
        instrumentality of Jews that the Gentiles received it. They carried it
        to their doors, and besought them to receive the blessing. From this we
        may learn the extent of the obligation, and the unity of the body of
        Christ. The services of any one of the Lord’s people lays those who
        receive them under obligations to the whole family to which they belong.
        If the Gentiles were under obligation to the Jewish brethren on account
        of being made partakers of the Gospel through their means, how much more
        are converts under obligation to those who are personally the means of
        their conversion. Spiritual things. — This phrase denotes the blessings
        of the Gospel, and communion with God, and everything that concerns the
        soul and body in their future state, as distinguished from those things
        that concern the wants of the body, and relate only to this world, which
        are called carnal things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — When, therefore, I have performed this and have sealed to
        them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. When, therefore, I have
        performed this. — That is, when I shall have finished what I have
        commenced as to the matter of the contribution. This would be when the
        poor of the saints at Jerusalem had received the gift of their brethren.
        And have sealed to them this fruit. — Several different interpretations
        are given of this; expression. The meaning appears to be this: fruit
        means fruit of the faith of the Gospel. The contribution of the Gentile
        churches was a fruit of their faith in Christ. As to the sealing of this
        fruit, it is to be remarked that a seal was used to stamp anything as
        genuine, and to distinguish it from a counterfeit. Now this fruit was a
        convincing evidence that their faith was real, and that the Gentiles had
        received the Gospel, not in name only, but in truth. The Apostle sealed
        this fruit, when he exhibited this evidence to the Jewish believers of
        the faith of their Gentile brethren. Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart, with
        others, understand this sealing as indicating the security, or making
        sure the contribution to those for whom it was destined. But this gives
        an unworthy view both of Paul and the Gentile churches. It represents
        him as personally undertaking the charge or conveyance of this
        contribution), in order that it might be more securely carried. But
        surely there were confidential persons in the churches who could have
        carried the money with as much security as the Apostle himself; and Paul
        would not indulge such an injurious jealousy with respect to the
        brethren. He had a higher object in conducting this mission of mercy to
        the Jewish brethren. By this means he would remove the doubts and disarm
        the jealousy of the Jews with respect to the Gentiles. No other object
        could be of sufficient importance to detain Paul from visiting Rome and
        Spain, but that paramount object of uniting the Jews and Gentiles. Union
        among Christians we here see even placed before the carrying of the
        Gospel to new countries. I will come by you into Spain. — What Paul had
        stated formerly as a matter of hope, he here states absolutely. An
        absolute statement, however, does not necessarily bind by promise, but
        is only a declaration of the full intention of the present moment. Men
        speak absolutely of their purposes when they are fully resolved to
        perform them. But sometimes these purposes it may not be possible to
        fulfill. A promise is a very different thing from an absolute
        declaration. Some persons act like mere caviling casuists in explaining
        duty with respect to this point. If a person once refuses the thing
        asked, it is looked on as a breach of truth if he afterwards yield. But
        there may be just reason to change his mind, and his absolute
        declaration in the negative was only the expression of his mind at the
        time of utterance. Some specialists have held that if a thing be matter
        of duty, gratitude is not due to the benefactor from him who receives
        the benefit, nor praise from others on account of it. This is false
        morality. To make this contribution was a duty as to the Gentiles, but
        it was the duty of the Jews to receive it with gratitude; and Paul, 2
        Corinthians 9:2, praises the performance. ‘I boast of you to them of
        Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago.’ Some persons would be
        afraid to bestow a word of commendation on the most disinterested
        Christian conduct; but the Apostle does not scruple to boast of the
        conduct of Christians. We may here also notice the condemnation of the
        false morality of some casuists.
      </p>
      <p>
        They hold it unscriptural, and contrary to the simplicity of the Gospel,
        to urge people to duty by any other motive than the love of God. But the
        Apostle urges forward the disciples by the zeal of other Christians. In
        fact, in Scripture, every motive belonging to human nature, as it is the
        work of God, is freely employed to urge to duty and deter from sin. The
        refinement which refuses any of the weapons that God has employed, is
        calculated not to promote but to injure the service of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 29. — And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
        fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I am sure. — Dr. Macknight limits this knowledge to the Apostle’s
        experience. But this limitation is improper. If he knew this, he could
        know it only from God. Fullness of the blessing of the Gospel — Paul was
        sure that God would give success to the Gospel, and that he would come
        in the fullness of this blessing — that is, with the richest measure of
        this success.
      </p>
      <p>
        This visit, then, would be fraught with the happiest results to the
        Romans.
      </p>
      <p>
        How ought Christian churches to go about all their affairs, and
        undertake all their work for the spreading of the kingdom and truth of
        Christ, with the most earnest prayers for this blessing! And all who
        preach the Gospel ought to look for this as essentially necessary to
        their success. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight expounds this, ‘I shall come empowered to bestow on you
        abundantly the gifts of the Spirit.’ This no doubt was included in the
        blessing, but it is far from exhausting it. Calvin’s view of the
        passage, which he mentions as the general one, cannot be approved. He
        prefers the interpretation that makes Paul express the conviction that
        he will find the Christians at Rome abounding in good works. The words
        have no appearance of expressing such a meaning. It is the Apostle
        himself who was to come in the fullness of this blessing. It is not said
        that when he should come he would find among them this blessing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 30. — Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake
        and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your
        prayers to God for me; Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus
        Christ’s sake. — To do everything for the sake of Christ, implies that
        the thing is agreeable to Christ. It must show love or obedience to Him.
        We could not be properly required to do anything for Christ’s sake which
        was contrary, or rather which we did not know to be agreeable, to the
        will of Christ. To pray for one another in our mutual difficulties, is a
        thing most pleasing and honorable to Christ. But when we are called upon
        for Christ’s sake to assist in the promotion or maintenance of
        superstition or false religion or in any way to support or countenance
        it, we ought to resist and not comply. The votaries of the Romish
        apostasy have the love of God or of Christ in their mouth continually
        when they call for assistance in their superstitious works. But the
        disciples of Christ ought to testify loudly against them, instead of
        bidding them God speed with their aid. For Christ’s sake implies also
        that those addressed are the people of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        They who are not such can do nothing for His sake. Love of the Spirit. —
        Some understand this of the love which the Spirit has for Christ’s
        people, and others of the love to one another which the Spirit works in
        them. The expression is capable in itself of either sense; and other
        considerations must determine the preference. Some unite both opinions,
        which is the most mischievous of all methods of interpretation, as it
        tends to encourage us in slothfulness with respect to the meaning of
        Scripture, and to a prostitution of Scripture as implying a sense which
        it does not truly bear. No passage unites two different senses at once.
        Yet those who, in interpreting Scripture, attach to it only one meaning,
        when, according to the best of their judgment, it is the true one, are
        often loudly accused of dogmatism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The love of God may be either God’s love to us, or our love to God; and
        accordingly, in Scripture, it is sometimes used in the one sense, and
        sometimes in the other. But it never at the same time signifies both. It
        is always the connection and other circumstances that must determine the
        meaning. The love of the Spirit here is most probably the love which the
        Spirit works in His people, which disposes them to love one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, from this principle of pure love, Paul entreats their prayers for
        himself. Love is not the fruit of the natural heart of man. Men are by
        nature hateful and hating one another. When sinners believe in Christ,
        the Holy Spirit produces in their hearts love to one another. This
        phrase, also, whether it refers to the love which the Spirit produces in
        believers, or which He has for them, clearly implies His Godhead. That
        ye strive together with me in your prayers. — The word here employed
        signifies the strongest exertion, alluding to the struggle of wrestlers
        in the games. Prayer, then, is not a formal exercise. This shows the
        great importance at all times, to the Lord’s people, of an ardent spirit
        of prayer. It is through prayer that the Lord is usually pleased to
        bestow His favors. He requires to be asked, and asked repeatedly and
        earnestly, for the things which He has promised to bestow. ‘Thus saith
        the Lord God,’ — in promising to confer the greatest blessings, — ’I
        will yet for this be inquired of by the house Of Israel to do it for
        them,’ Ezekiel 36:37. To God, namely, the Father. — This verse refers to
        the whole Godhead — the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and here
        the distinct personality of the Holy Ghost, His power and influence, are
        referred to, as in verses 13, 16, and 19. For me. — This shows the
        propriety and importance of prayer for one another. Even the Apostle
        Paul, with all his distinguishing privileges, deems it a matter of the
        greatest importance to himself. If Paul needed the prayers of his
        brethren, who were so far behind him, can they be unimportant to
        Christ’s people in general?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 31. — That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in
        Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of
        the saints; That I may be delivered. — What was the thing for which the
        Apostle requested the prayers of his fellow-Christians? It was to be
        delivered from death and danger in the discharge of his work. This shows
        that, how willing so ever we ought to be to sacrifice our lives for
        Christ’s sake, yet that, as far as possible, we ought to desire to
        preserve life. The Apostle is not ashamed to call on his brethren to
        unite in the most fervent supplications for his preservation from death,
        and from the hand of his enemies. How different is this from the
        language of Ignatius, who seemed rather to call for the prayers of his
        brethren that he might be honored with a crown of martyrdom, than to be
        preserved from his enemies. Christians ought to be willing to give their
        lives for Christ rather than deny Him or refuse to do any part of His
        known will. But it is not only lawful but dutiful to take every proper
        means for their deliverance out of danger. If even an Apostle, in the
        cause of Christ, was so desirous of preserving life, what shall we think
        of those who profess a spirit of indifference respecting it, which would
        wantonly throw it away? Them that do not believe in Judea. — Paul knew
        the danger of the visit to his countrymen. He was in greater danger in
        Jerusalem than in any of the most barbarous heathen countries; yet he
        did not decline his duty. This is true Christian courage. We ought to
        take every precaution to preserve our lives, but we ought not to decline
        duty to save them. We should go forward, and look to God to deliver us
        out of the hand of them who do not believe. Those who reject the Gospel
        will always be its enemies, and from such, therefore, the Apostle prays
        to be delivered. The Gospel declares not only salvation to those who
        believe, but damnation to all who reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It must then be an object of hatred to all who do not believe. And it is
        remarkable that, while the most debasing superstitious are looked upon
        with indifference by the wise men of the world, the coolest and most
        philosophic of their number kindle into wrath against the Gospel. If,
        then, the Apostle foresaw the danger of this visit to Jerusalem, and if
        he so strongly desired to be delivered from it, his object of visiting
        his countrymen must have been exceedingly important. My service. — Paul
        was in the highest dignity of the Church of Christ on earth, yet he
        willingly undertook an office of the most dangerous service for the
        supply of the temporal wants of his brethren. For Jerusalem. — This is
        another instance of figurative language employed by inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jerusalem is put for the saints in Jerusalem — the city for the
        inhabitants, and not all the inhabitants, but certain inhabitants well
        known to the reader. May be accepted. — This seems at first sight very
        strange What fear could there be that the supply of the wants of the
        distressed would not be acceptable to them? Yet Paul makes it a matter
        of the most earnest prayer for himself and his brethren to whom he
        writes, that the saints at Jerusalem might be disposed to receive the
        gift cordially. This, beyond all contradiction, shows how averse the
        Jews were to the Gentiles, and the reason why the Apostle urged this
        collection so strongly, and conducted the mission in his own person. Why
        shall we now expect perfection in knowledge or attainments among the
        people of God? In the apostolic churches we indeed see none recognized
        as members but such as were judged to be believers, but they were
        believers with every degree of weakness, both in knowledge and in
        character. Calvin understands Paul’s doubts with respect to the
        acceptableness of the gift of the Gentiles, to have reference to
        prejudice against himself on the part of the believing Jews. But this
        has no just foundation; and, had this been the fear, the danger could
        have been easily prevented without exposing Paul to the persecution of
        the unbelievers. Could not Paul have sent the money by the hands of
        others? This would have guarded against the supposed prejudice of the
        brethren in Jerusalem, and have prevented the danger of death with
        respect to Paul from the hands of unbelieving Jews.

        Ver. 32. — That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may
        with you be refreshed.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I may come unto you with joy. — Dr. Macknight, as well as Calvin,
        understands this as the result of the prayer, and not as one of the
        things prayed for. The result of the acceptable reception of the gift
        would be Paul’s joyful visit to Rome. But, most evidently, the words
        referred to are not the supposed result of the prayer, but are a part of
        the prayer itself, along with the other things before mentioned. The
        Apostle besought them not only to pray that the saints at Jerusalem
        might accept the gift, but, in addition to this, they were desired to
        pray that he might, after delivering the gift, come to them with joy. It
        would no doubt be a matter of joy for the Apostle that the gift of which
        he was the bearer might be well received.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it is not to this solely that he refers, but to joy in general. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight seems to be greatly mistaken when he says, ‘How much the
        Apostle was disappointed in his generous design, and in what
        disadvantageous circumstances he came to Rome, the history of the Acts
        informs us.’ There is every reason to believe that the gift was well
        received. He was indeed disappointed with respect to the manner of his
        coming to Rome, but he might not be disappointed in his joy when he
        arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we may learn that if even on God’s errand we have need of
        prayer for success in our journey, how much more do we need prayer in
        our own daily business! So much does God encourage the exercise of
        prayer, that He wills us to pray for success when we do His own work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole passage also, is the strongest refutation of the theory of
        those who suppose that prayer is useless, because of the unchangeable
        purposes of God. The express command of the Spirit of inspiration
        annihilates all the subtle speculations of men on this subject. We here
        see that it is not only lawful and proper to pray to the unchangeable
        God, but that it is our duty to pray to Him to prosper us even in His
        own work. How unlike is God’s book to human wisdom! — on every page
        there shines the evidence of its Divine origin. By the will of God. —
        This shows us that all events depend on God’s will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing happens without His appointment. All the efforts of his enemies,
        as well as all the exertions of His servants, only fulfill His
        irresistible purposes. Without His will, nothing takes place on earth
        more than in heaven. God not only permits everything that takes place on
        earth, as some are inclined in this way to soften down His sovereignty,
        but He wills and appoints it. Calvin well observes on this passage ‘The
        sentence, By the will of God, instructs us in the necessity of devoting
        ourselves to prayer, since God alone directs all our paths and all our
        steps by his gracious and unerring providence.’ And may with you be
        refreshed. — The word literally signifies to recline together in order
        to mutual rest, and, in a secondary sense, to be refreshed together
        after fatigue. Here it beautifully expresses that mutual comfort and
        refreshment which believers, amidst their toils, and dangers, and
        troubles in the world, enjoy in speaking together of the things of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reflect on the word of God gives great refreshment, but to reflect on
        this in company with other Christians is the most heavenly exercise. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight confines the refreshment to the subject of the reconciliation
        of the Jews with the Gentiles. But it refers to every consolation that
        might be the object of their conversation about the things of Christ.
        From this we see that the Apostle had, like other believers, the same
        need of refreshment from reflection on the word of God, and from
        intercourse with the brethren. Paul is not ashamed to speak of the
        refreshment which he expected from the company of the Roman Christians,
        as well as of that which they should receive from his company.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 33. — Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>
      <p>
        Now the God of peace be with you all. — In this manner the Apostle
        concludes this part of his Epistle to the believers at Rome, wishing
        them the presence and the blessing of the God of peace. This expression
        is used only by Paul in his Epistles, in which he employs it frequently.
        Peace, in scripture, signifies generally all kinds of good and
        prosperity; as it is said, Isaiah 45:7, ‘I form the light, and create
        darkness: I make peace, and create evil.’ To say, then, that God is the
        God of peace, is to say that He is the author of every blessing. The
        Spirit of God calls the good state of the conscience of the believer
        peace and prosperity, whatever may be his case regarding things
        external. His peace Jesus promised to His disciples: ‘Peace I leave with
        you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto
        you.’ But peace may be taken particularly for the love through which God
        has reconciled His people to Himself by Jesus Christ, thus expressing
        the goodness of God revealed in the Gospel In the Old Testament, God is
        called the Lord of Hosts; but in the New Testament, having made peace by
        the blood of the cross of His Son, He is pleased to call Himself the God
        of peace. It is this peace which the angel, with the heavenly host,
        celebrated in saying, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
        good will toward men.’ The Apostles usually express this in their
        salutations, saying, ‘Grace and peace be with you, from God our Father
        and the Lord Jesus Christ,’ uniformly, however, placing grace first,
        without which they could not have peace. Paul, in here employing this
        title, the God of peace, indicates the free access which His people have
        to God, and the assurance that their petitions shall be heard; for what
        shall they not obtain from Him who has laid aside all His wrath, and
        breathes towards them only grace and peace? We see, then, the efficacy
        of the peace of God, and what consolation believers should experience,
        and what confidence towards God in their prayers, when they consider
        that God is the God of peace.
