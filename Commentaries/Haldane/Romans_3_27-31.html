      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        AT the opening of his discussion, ch. 1:16, 17, Paul had announced that
        the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
        believeth, because therein is the righteousness of God revealed. He had
        said that the righteous by faith shall live, intimating that there is no
        other way of obtaining life. In proof of this, he had declared that the
        wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
        unrighteousness of men, and had shown at large that both Jews and
        Gentiles are all under sin, and that, therefore, by obedience to law no
        flesh shall be justified. He now proceeds to speak more particularly of
        the righteousness of God provided for man’s justification, describing
        the manner in which it is conferred, and the character of those by whom
        it is received. To this subject, therefore, he here reverts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — But now the righteousness of God without law is manifested,
        being witnessed by the law and the prophets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, — that is to say, under the preaching of the Gospel — in the period
        of the revelation of the Messiah; for it denotes the time present, in
        opposition to that time when God appeared not to take notice of the
        state of the Gentile nations as it is said, Acts 17:30, ‘The times of
        this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to
        repent.’ And also in opposition to the legal economy respecting the
        Jews, as again it is said, John 1:17, ‘The law was given by Moses, but
        grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.’ This is what the Scriptures call
        ‘ the fullness of times,’ Ephesians 1:10; Galatians 4:4. ‘The last
        days,’ Isaiah 2:2; Hebrews 1:2; Acts 2:17; 1 John 2:18. ‘The acceptable
        year of the Lord,’ Isaiah 61:2. ‘Now is the accepted time; behold, now
        is the day of salvation,’ 2 Corinthians 6:2. The day of the Savior that
        Abraham saw, John 8:56. The righteousness of God. — This is one of the
        most important expressions in the Scriptures. It frequently occurs both
        in the Old Testament and the New; it stands connected with the argument
        of the whole of the first five chapters of this Epistle, and signifies
        that fulfillment of the law which God has provided, by the imputation of
        which sinners are saved. Although perfectly clear in itself, its meaning
        has been involved in much obscurity by the learned labors of some who
        know not the truth, and by the perversions of others by whom it has been
        greatly corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        By many it has been misunderstood, and has in general been very slightly
        noticed even by those whose views on the subject are correct and
        scriptural. To consider its real signification is the more necessary, as
        it does not appear always to receive that attention from Christians
        which its importance demands. When the question is put, why is the
        Gospel the power of God unto salvation? how few give the clear and
        unfaltering answer of the Apostle, Because therein is THE RIGHTEOUSNESS
        OF GOD revealed. Before attending to the true import of this phrase, it
        is proper to advert to some of the significations erroneously attached
        to it. Of these I shall select only a few examples from many that might
        be furnished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Origin understood by this righteousness God’s attribute of justice,
        while Chrysostom explained it as Divine clemency.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Dr. Campbell of Aberdeen, the righteousness of God consists
        in man’s conformity to the declared will of God. In his note on Matthew
        6:33, he says, ‘The righteousness of God, in our idiom, can mean only
        the justice or moral rectitude of the Divine nature, which it were
        absurd in us to seek, it being, as all God’s attributes are, inseparable
        from His essence. But in the Hebrew idiom, that righteousness, which
        consists in a conformity to the declared will of God, is called His
        righteousness. In this way the phrase is used by Paul, Romans 3:21,22;
        10:3, where the righteousness of God is opposed by the Apostle to that
        of the unconverted Jews; and their own righteousness, which he tells us
        they went about to establish, does not appear to signify their personal
        righteousness, any more than the righteousness of God signifies His
        personal righteousness. The word righteousness, as I conceive, denotes
        there what we should call a system of morality or righteousness, which
        he denominates their own, because fabricated by themselves, founded
        partly on the letter of the law, partly on tradition, and consisting
        mostly in ceremonies and mere externals. ‘This creature of their own
        imaginations they had cherished, to the neglect of that purer scheme of
        morality which was truly of God, which they might have learned even
        formerly from the law and the Prophets, properly understood, but now
        more explicitly from the doctrine of Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Such is the explanation by this learned critic of that leading phrase,
        ‘the righteousness of God,’ according to which, the reason why the
        Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, is, because therein a pure
        schemes of morality is revealed. Were this explanation just, so far from
        being the reason why the Gospel should be the means of salvation to
        sinners, it would be the cause of their universal and hopeless
        condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight supposes that the righteousness of God signifies a
        righteousness belonging to faith itself, and not the righteousness
        conveyed and received by faith. ‘Righteousness by faith,’ he says, on
        Romans 3:22, ‘is called the righteousness of God, — 1st , Because God
        hath enjoined faith as the righteousness which He will count to sinners,
        and hath declared that He will accept and reward it as righteousness;
        2nd , Because it stands in opposition to the righteousness of men, which
        consists in a sinless obedience to the law of God.’ Thus, while Dr.
        Macknight differs from Dr. Campbell in the meaning of the expression,
        the righteousness of God, he so far coincides with him in his radical
        error as to suppose that it does not signify the righteousness which God
        provides for the salvation of sinners, but the righteousness which He
        requires them to perform. The explanations of both of these writers are
        destructive of the Scripture doctrine of justification, opposed to the
        justice of God, subversive of the plan of salvation, and render the
        whole train of the Apostle’s reasoning, from Romans 1:16 to the end of
        the fifth chapter, inconclusive and self contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Archbishop Newcombe, whose translations are so much eulogized by
        Socinians, together with many who have followed him, translates this
        phrase, ‘God’s method of justification.’ What the Apostle has declared
        in precise terms, is thus converted into a general and indefinite
        annunciation, pointing to a different sense. In the Socinian version, as
        might be anticipated, it is also translated, ‘God’s method of
        justification.’ ‘The righteousness of God’ cannot mean God’s method of
        justification nor the justification which God bestows, because the word
        translated righteousness does not signify justification. Righteousness
        and justification are two things quite different. God’s righteousness is
        revealed in the Gospel, just as God Himself is said to be revealed. To
        reveal God is not to reveal a method of God’s acting, and to reveal
        God’s righteousness is not to reveal a method of God’s making sinners
        righteous, but to reveal the righteousness itself. This righteousness is
        also said to be of God by faith, that is, sinners become partakers of it
        by faith. The righteousness of God, then, is not a method of
        justification, but the thing itself which God has provided, and which He
        confers through faith. Nor can the expression, ‘the righteousness of
        God,’ in the tenth chapter, signify God’s method of justification. It is
        true the Jews were ignorant of God’s method of justification, but that
        is not the thing which is there asserted. They were ignorant of the
        righteousness which God had provided for the guilty, and, in
        consequence, went about to establish their own righteousness. What is
        there meant by God’s righteousness, is seen by the contrast. It is
        opposed to their own righteousness. Now, it was not a method of
        justification that the Jews went about to establish, but it was their
        own righteousness which they endeavored to establish — a righteousness
        in which they trusted, of their own working. If so, the righteousness of
        God contrasted with this must be, not a method of justification, but the
        righteousness which God confers on His people through faith. To
        establish a man’s righteousness is not to establish a method with
        respect to this, but to establish the thing itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say that the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, because that
        in it is revealed a divine method of justification, or the justification
        which God bestows, leaves the great question which immediately presents
        itself utterly without an answer. It gives no light to the reader as to
        what the Gospel reveals. It is only in general a Divine scheme of
        justification. But the language itself, Romans 1:17, leaves no such
        uncertainty. It shows that the Gospel is the power of God unto
        salvation, because it reveals God’s righteousness, — that righteousness
        which fulfills the demands of His law, which His justice will accept,
        and which is upon all them that believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Tholuck explains the phrase, the righteousness of God, thus: — ’The
        Gospel makes known a way to that perfect fulfillment of the law which is
        required by God.’ What is the meaning of this exposition? It does not
        give the true meaning, and may have a most erroneous import. The best
        that can be said for it is, that it is so dark, and vague, and
        equivocal, that it may elude condemnation on the principle of its not
        having any one definite meaning. It is more ambiguous than the answer of
        an oracle that has only two meanings, for it may have several. Does it
        mean that the Gospel reveals a way by which man may himself fulfill the
        law, so as to be perfectly righteous? If Mr. Tholuck does not mean this,
        the expression might mean it. Does it mean that the law is not yet
        fulfilled, but that the Gospel reveals a way in which it may be
        fulfilled? This is the most obvious sense. Does it mean that the Gospel
        reveals a way in which men perfectly fulfill the law by faith? This is
        evidently false, even according to Mr. Tholuck’s sentiments; for though
        faith were, as held forth by him, ‘the most excellent of virtues,’ he
        could not admit that it fulfills the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this dark and vague account of the term righteousness we need not
        wonder at that most erroneous meaning which he affixes to it in chapter
        4:3. f16 Mr. Stuart, in his translation of the Epistle, renders this
        phrase, in Romans 1:17, and 3:21, ‘The justification which is of God,’
        and in His explanation of it, the justification which God bestows, or
        the justification of which God is the author.’ He observes that this ‘is
        a phrase among the most important which the New Testament contains, and
        fundamental in the right interpretation of the Epistle before us.’ This
        is true; and the effect of his misunderstanding the proper signification
        of the original word in these passages, and rendering it justification
        instead of righteousness , appears most prominently in several of his
        subsequent interpretations especially as shall afterwards be pointed out
        in the beginning of the fourth chapter, where, like Mr. Tholuck, he
        entirely misrepresents the doctrine of justification. His translation he
        endeavors to defend at some length; but none of his allegations support
        his conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proper meaning of the original word in ch. 1:17, and 3:21, which he
        makes justification, is righteousness; and this meaning will apply in
        the other passages where it is found. In the New Testament it occurs
        ninety-two times, and, in the common version, is uniformly rendered
        righteousness. It occurs thirty-six times in the Epistle to the Romans,
        in which Mr. Stuart has sixteen times translated it righteousness. But
        he appears to have been led to adopt the translation he has given in the
        above verses from the supposed necessity of the case; and, indeed, this
        was necessary for Mr. Stuart, who not only denies expressly the
        imputation of Adam’s sin to his posterity, but also the imputation of
        Christ’s righteousness to believers. This should put Christians on their
        guard against a translation founded on the denial that Christ’s
        righteousness is placed to their account for salvation, a doctrine which
        Dr. Macknight most ignorantly maintains is not to be found in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart observes that there are three expressions, viz., dikaiosu>nh,
        dikai>wma , and dikai>wsiv , all employed occasionally in the very same
        sense, viz., that of justification, i.e., acquittal, pardon, freeing
        from condemnation, accepting and treating as righteous.’ There may be
        situations in which the one might supply the place of the other, but
        they have a clear characteristic difference. ‘The difference appears to
        be this: dikaiosu>nh , the original word in the verse before us, is not
        justification; it signifies justice or righteousness in the abstract;
        that is, the quality of righteousness. It signifies also complete
        conformity or obedience to the law; for if there be any breach of the
        law, there is no righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dikai>wma , as distinguished from this, signifies an act of
        righteousness, or some righteous deed. It is accordingly used for the
        ordinances of God, because they are His righteous appointments, and
        perhaps because they typically refer to the true ‘righteousness of God.’
        In a few places it may be an equivalent to dikaiosu>nh. Dikai>wsiv, is
        neither the one nor the other of the above. It is the act of being
        justified by this righteousness when on trial. Obedience to law is a
        different thing from being cleared, or acquitted, or justified, when
        tried by law. A man is justified on the ground of righteousness. There
        is the same difference between dikaiosu>n , and dikai>wsiv, that there
        is in English between righteousness and justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In support of his explanation of the phrase, ‘the righteousness of God,’
        namely, that it is the justification which God bestows, Mr. Stuart, in
        the following observations, shows a wonderful misapprehension of the
        doctrine of those who oppose the view of it which he adopts. On verse he
        says, ‘What that dikaiosu>nh de< qeou~ (righteousness of God) is, which
        is cwri>v no>mou (without law), the Apostle next proceeds explicitly to
        develop. Dikaiosu>nh de... jIhsou~ Cristou~ , the justification which is
        of God by faith in Jesus Christ. This explanation makes it clear as the
        noonday sun that dikaiosu>nh qeou~ (righteousness of God), in this
        connection, does not mean righteousness, or the love of justice, as an
        attribute of God. For in what possible sense can it be said that God’s
        righteousness or justice (as an essential attribute) is by faith in
        Christ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Does He possess or exercise this attribute, or reveal it, by faith in
        Christ?
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is so plain; that it cannot be mistaken,’ p. 157. Why does
        Mr. Stuart labor to prove that the phrase in question cannot here mean
        the justice of God, or a Divine attribute? Does any man suppose that it
        has here such a sense? We do not understand it of a Divine attribute,
        but of conformity to law by a Divine work. This righteousness is God’s
        righteousness, not because it is an attribute of His nature, but because
        it is the righteousness which God has provided and effected for His
        people, through the obedience unto death of His own Son. The word
        dikaiosu>nh , indeed, always signifies righteousness; but it may mean
        either a personal attribute, or conformity to law. Does not Mr. Stuart
        himself afterwards explain the phrase in this latter sense? Why, then,
        does he take it for granted that if it does not signify justification,
        as he makes it here, it must signify a personal attribute of God? In ch.
        4:3, 6, and elsewhere, he admits that the word dikaiosu>nh
        (righteousness) cannot signify justification, but must be understood as
        denoting righteousness. ‘To say,’ he observes (p. 177), ‘was counted for
        justification would make no tolerable sense.’ But nothing can be more
        obvious than that the Apostle is in the fourth chapter treating of the
        same thing of which he is treating in this chapter, from the 21st verse.
        In all this connection he is still speaking of this dikaiosu>nh
        (righteousness) in the same view. Having here spoken of God’s
        righteousness, he goes on to show that it was through this very
        righteousness that Abraham was justified The justification of Abraham,
        instead of being an exception to what he had been teaching, as if it had
        been on the ground of Abraham’s own obedience to law, is appealed to by
        the Apostle as a proof, as well as an illustration and example, of
        justification by God’s righteousness received by faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        It makes nothing in favor of Mr. Stuart that there may be instances in
        which the word dikaiosu>nh (righteousness) may be interpreted by the
        word justification, so as to make sense. There is no signification that
        may not be ascribed to any word upon this principle. A word may make
        sense in a passage, when it is explained in a meaning directly the
        opposite of its true meaning. This principle the reader may see fully
        established in the writings of Dr. Carson. Several instances have been
        alleged from the Septuagint, in which it is asserted that dikaiosu>nh
        (has the meaning of goodness, etc.; but there is no instance there in
        which the word may not have its true meaning, and it is only ignorance
        of the import of the phrase, ‘righteousness of God,’ that has induced
        writers to give the term a different meaning. For instance, nothing at
        first sight appears more to countenance the idea that dikaiosu>nh
        (righteousness) expresses mercy than Psalm 51:14. How could David speak
        of righteousness, if God would deliver him from blood-guiltiness? He
        might well speak of goodness or compassion, but would not righteousness
        in God prevent him from being acquitted? Not so. The righteousness of
        God was what David looked to, — the same righteousness that is more
        clearly revealed by Paul in this Epistle. And well might David speak of
        that righteousness, when by it he was cleared from all the guilt of his
        enormous wickedness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word rendered ‘righteousness,’ Romans 1:17, and in the verse before
        us, signifies both justice and righteousness; that is to say, conformity
        to the law. But while both of these expressions denote this conformity,
        there is an essential difference between them. Justice imports
        conformity to the law in executing its sentence; righteousness,
        conformity in obeying its precepts, and this is the meaning of the word
        here. If these ideas be interchanged or confounded, as they often are,
        the whole scope of the Apostle’s reasoning will be misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>
        In various parts of Scripture this phrase, ‘the righteousness of God,’
        signifies either that holiness and rectitude of character which is the
        attribute of God, or that distributive justice by which He maintains the
        authority of His law; but where it refers to man’s salvation, and is not
        merely a personal attribute of Deity, it signifies, as in the passage
        before us, ver. 21, that fulfillment of the law, or perfect conformity
        to it in all its demands, which, consistently with His justice, God has
        appointed and provided for the salvation of sinners. This implies that
        the infinite justice of His character requires what is provided, and
        also that it is approved and accepted; for if it be God’s righteousness,
        it must be required, and must be accepted by the justice of God. The
        righteousness of God, which is received by faith, denotes something that
        becomes the property of the believer. It cannot, then, be here the
        Divine attribute of justice, but the Divine work which God has wrought
        through His Son. This, therefore, determines the phrase in this place as
        referring immediately not to the Divine attribute, but to the Divine
        work. The former never can become ours. This also is decisive against
        explaining the phrase as signifying a Divine method of justification.
        The righteousness of God is contrasted with the righteousness of man;
        and as Israel’s own righteousness, which they went about to establish,
        was the righteousness of their works, not their method of justification,
        so God’s righteousness, as opposed to this, Romans 10:3, must be a
        righteousness wrought by Jehovah. As in Corinthians 5:21, the imputation
        of sin to Christ is contrasted with our becoming the righteousness of
        God in Him, the latter cannot be a method of justification, but must
        intimate our becoming perfectly righteous by possessing Christ’s
        righteousness, which is provided by God for us, and is perfectly
        commensurate with the Divine justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        No explanation of the expression, ‘the righteousness of God,’ will at
        once suit the phrase and the situation in which it is found in the
        passage before us, but that which makes it that righteousness, or
        obedience to the law, both in its penalty and requirements, which has
        been yielded to it by our Lord Jesus Christ. This is indeed the
        righteousness of God, for it has been provided by God, and from first to
        last has been effected by His Son Jesus Christ, who is the mighty God
        and the Father of eternity. Everything that draws it off from this
        signification tends to darken the Scriptures, to cloud the apprehension
        of the truth in the children of God, and to corrupt the simplicity that
        is in Christ. To that righteousness is the eye of the believer ever to
        be directed; on that righteousness must he rest; on that righteousness
        must he live; on that righteousness must he die; in that righteousness
        must he appear before the judgment-seat; in that righteousness must he
        stand for ever in the presence of a righteous God. ‘I will greatly
        rejoice in the Lord; my soul shall be joyful in my God: for He hath
        clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the
        robe of righteousness,’ Isaiah 61:10.
      </p>
      <p>
        The righteousness of God provided for the salvation of sinners, like
        that salvation itself, differs essentially from all other righteousness
        that ever was or can ever be performed. It differs entirely from the
        righteousness of men and angels in itsAUTHOR, for it is the
        righteousness not of creatures but of the Creator. ‘I the Lord have
        created it, ’ Isaiah 45:8. It is a Divine and infinitely perfect
        righteousness, wrought out by Jehovah Himself, which in the salvation of
        man preserves all His attributes inviolate. It is the righteousness of
        God, as of the Godhead, without respect to distinction of personality,
        and strictly so in that sense in which the world is the work of God. The
        Father created it by the Son, in the same way as by the Son He created
        the world: and if the Father effected this righteousness because His Son
        effected it, then His Son must be one with Himself. Peter, in his Second
        Epistle, ch. <600101> 1:1, according to the literal rendering of the
        passage, calls this righteousness the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
        ‘Simon Peter, a servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
        have obtained like precious faith with us, in the righteousness of our
        God and Savior Jesus Christ.’ Most of the places in which the
        righteousness of God is spoken of, refer to it as the righteousness of
        the Fatherly as in 2 Corinthians 5:21, where the Father is distinguished
        from the Son; but in this passage of Peter it is explicitly declared to
        be the righteousness of the Son, where He is expressly called God. As it
        would be a palpable contradiction to assert that the work of creation
        could be executed by any creature, for He that built all things must be
        God, so the righteousness of God could not be ascribed to Jesus Christ
        unless He had been in the beginning, ‘God,’ ‘with God,’ and ‘over all,
        God blessed for ever.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It was dueling His incarnation that the Son of God wrought out this
        righteousness. Before He came into the world, He was not a member or
        subject of the kingdom of heaven, — He was its Head. He then acted in
        the form of God, — that is to say, as the Creator and Sovereign of the
        world, — but afterwards in the form of a servant. Before that period He
        was perfectly holy, but that holiness could not be called obedience. It
        might rather be said that the law was conformed to Him, than that He was
        conformed to the law. His holiness was exercised in making the law, and
        by it governing the world. But in His latter condition it was that law
        by which He Himself was governed. His righteousness or obedience, then,
        was that of infinitely the most glorious person that could be subjected
        to the law. It was the righteousness of Emmanuel, God with us; and this
        obedience of the Son of God in our nature conferred more honor on the
        law than the obedience of all intelligent creatures. He gave to every
        commandment of the law, and to every duty it enjoined, more honor that
        it had received of dishonor from all the transgressors that have been in
        the world. When others obey the law, they derive from that obedience
        honor to themselves; but on the occasion now referred to, it was the law
        that was honored by the obedience of its Sovereign. ‘The Lord,’ says the
        Prophet, ‘is well pleased for His righteousness’ sake; He will magnify
        the law, and make it honorable,’ Isaiah 42:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obedience of Jesus Christ magnified the law, because it was rendered
        by Divine appointment. He was chosen of God, and anointed for this end.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was Jehovah, whom Jehovah sent. ‘Lo, I come, and I will dwell in the
        midst of thee, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of Hosts
        hath sent Me unto thee,’ Zechariah 2:10,11. And when it is considered
        that the most astonishing work of God which can be conceived is the
        incarnation of His Son, and His sojourning in the world, and that these
        wonders were performed in order to magnify the law, it necessarily
        follows that it is impossible to entertain too exalted an idea of the
        regard which God has for the character of His holy law. In itsAUTHOR,
        then, this righteousness is immeasurably distinguished from any other
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        And not Only does it differ in itsAUTHOR it differs also in itsNATURE,
        in itsEXTENT, in itsDURATION, and in itsINFLUENCE, from all other
        righteousness that ever was or ever can be performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In itsNATURE this righteousness is twofold, fulfilling both the precept
        of the law and its penalty. This, by any creature the most exalted, is
        absolutely impossible. The fulfillment of the law, in its precepts, is
        all that could be required of creatures in their original sinless
        condition. Such was at the beginning the state of all the angels, and of
        the first man. But the state of the Second Man, the Lord from heaven,
        when He came into the world, was essentially different. Christ was made
        under the law, but it was aBROKEN LAW; and consequently He was made
        under its curse. This is not only implied when it is said, He was ‘made
        of a woman,’ who was a transgressor, but it is also expressly asserted
        that He was ‘made a curse for us,’ Galatians 3:13. Justice therefore
        required that He should fulfill not only the precept, but also the
        penalty of the law, — all that it threatens, as well as all that it
        commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mere creature may obey the precept of the law, or suffer the penalty
        it denounces, but he cannot do both. If he be a transgressor, he may be
        punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord; and
        God, whose vengeance he is suffering, being to him an object of
        unmingled hatred and abhorrence, there can be no place for his
        repentance, his love, or obedience. But Jesus Christ was capable at the
        same moment of suffering at the hand of God and of obeying the precept
        to love God. This was made manifest during the whole period of His
        incarnation, as well as by the memorable words which He uttered on the
        cross, ‘My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?’ We are here taught
        that the prediction by the Prophet, ‘Awake, O sword, against the man
        that is My fellow,’ was at that moment receiving its accomplishment. The
        sword of Divine justice, according to the prophetic declarations
        contained in the 22nd Psalm, was then piercing His in most soul, but
        still He addressed God as His God.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this it is evident that, while suffering under the full weight of
        His Father’s wrath against the sins of His people, which He had taken
        upon Him, all the feedings both of love and confidence also expressed in
        the same Psalm were at that moment in full exercise. His righteousness,
        therefore, or conformity to the law, was at once a conformity in two
        respects, which could not have been exemplified but by Himself
        throughout the whole universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the sufferings of Jesus Christ, the execution of the law was
        complete; while no punishment which creatures could suffer can be thus
        designated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law was fully executed when all the threatenings it contained were
        carried into effect. Those who are consigned to everlasting punishment
        will never be able to say, as our blessed Lord said on the cross, ‘It is
        finished.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is He only who could put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself By
        enduring the threatened punishment, He fully satisfied justice. In token
        of having received a full discharge, He came forth from the grave; and
        when He shall appear the second time, it shall be without sin, — the sin
        which He had taken upon Him, and all its effects, being for ever done
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        This fulfillment of the law, in its penalty, by the Son of God, is an
        end which cannot otherwise than through eternity be attained by the
        punishment of mere creatures. Sin, as committed against God, is an
        infinite evil, and request an infinite punishment, which cannot be borne
        in any limited time by those who are not capable of suffering punishment
        in an infinite degree. But the sufferings, as well as the obedience, in
        time, of Him who is infinite, are equivalent to the eternal obedience
        and sufferings of those who are finite.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctrine that sin is an infinite evil, and requires an infinite
        punishment, is objected to by the Socinians. They say that if each sin
        we commit merits eternal death — in other words, an infinite punishment
        — and since there are almost an infinite number of sins committed by
        men, then it must be said that they merit an almost infinite number of
        punishments, and consequently that they cannot be expiated but by a like
        number of infinite satisfactions. It is replied, that the infinite value
        of the death of the Redeemer equals an infinite number of infinite
        punishments.
      </p>
      <p>
        For such is the nature of infinitude, that it admits of no degrees; it
        knows nothing of more or less; it cannot be measured; it cannot be
        augmented; so that ten thousand infinities are still only one infinite.
        And if Jesus Christ had suffered death as many times as the number of
        the sins of the redeemed, His satisfaction would not have been greater
        or more complete than by the one death which He suffered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The death of the Son of God serves to magnify the law, by demonstrating
        the certainty of that eternal punishment, which, if broken, it denounces
        as its penalty. There are no limits to eternity; but when the Son of God
        bore what was equivalent to the eternal punishment of those who had
        sinned, He furnished a visible demonstration of the eternal punishment
        of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if nothing beyond the suffering of the penalty of the law had taken
        place, men would only have been released from the punishment due to sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they were to obtain the reward of obedience, its precepts must also
        be obeyed; and this was accomplished to the utmost by Jesus Christ.
        Every command it enjoins, as well as every prohibition it contains, were
        in all respects fully honored by Him. In this manner, and by His
        sufferings, He fulfilled all righteousness The righteousness, therefore,
        of our God and Savior Jesus Christ is infinitely glorious. It is the
        righteousness of the Lawgiver; and, being in its character twofold, it
        differs entirely in its\parNATURE from all other righteousness, and is
        of an order infinitely higher than ever was or can be exemplified by any
        or all of the orders of intelligent creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This righteousness differs also from all other righteousness in
        itsEXTENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every creature is bound for himself to all that obedience to his Creator
        of which he is capable. He is under the obligation to love God with all
        his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, and beyond this
        he cannot advance. It is evident, therefore, that he can have no
        superabounding righteousness to be placed in the way of merit to the
        account of another.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, besides this, if he has sinned, he is bound to suffer for himself
        the whole penalty annexed to disobedience, no part of which,
        consequently, can be borne by him to satisfy for the transgression of
        others. He is not in possession of a life at his own disposal to lay
        down for them; and if he had laid it down, it being in that case
        forfeited for ever, he could not take it again. But the obedience of
        Jesus Christ, who is Himself infinite, as well as the punishment He
        suffered, being in themselves of infinite value, are capable of being
        transferred in their effects without any diminution in their respective
        values. His life, too, was His own; and as He suffered voluntarily, His
        obedience and sufferings, which were infinitely meritorious, might, with
        the most perfect regard to justice, be imputed to as many of those of
        whose nature He partook, as to the Supreme Ruler shall seem good.
      </p>
      <p>
        This righteousness likewise differs from all other righteousness in
        its\parDURATION. The righteousness of Adam or of angels could only be
        available while it continued to be performed. The law was binding on
        them in every instant of their existence. The moment, therefore, in
        which they transgressed, the advantages derived from all their previous
        obedience ceased. But the righteousness of God, brought in by His Son,
        is an ‘everlasting righteousness,’ Daniel 9:24. It was performed within
        a limited period of time, but in its effects it can never terminate.
        ‘Lift up your eyes to heaven, and look upon the earth beneath; for the
        heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
        garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but My
        salvation shall be for ever, and My righteousness shall not be abolished
        — My righteousness shall before ever,’ Isaiah 51:6,8. ‘Thy righteousness
        is an everlasting righteousness,’ <19B9142> Psalm 119:142. ‘By one
        offering He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,’ Hebrews
        10:14. ‘By His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having
        obtained eternal redemption,’ Hebrews 9:12. In respect to its duration,
        then, this righteousness reaches back to the period of man’s fall, and
        forward through the endless ages of eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paramountINFLUENCE of this righteousness is also gloriously
        conspicuous. It is the sole ground of the reconciliation of sinners with
        God, and their justification before Him, and also of intercession with
        Him before the throne. ‘If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the
        Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, ’ 1 John 2:1. It is the price paid
        for those new heavens and that new earth, wherein dwelleth
        righteousness; for that kingdom prepared for those who are clothed with
        righteousness — a kingdom commensurate with the dignity of Him for whom
        it was provided. The paradise in which Adam was placed at his creation
        was a paradise on earth. It might be corrupted, it might be defiled, and
        it might fade away, all of which accordingly took place. But the
        paradise which, in virtue of the righteousness of God, is provided, and
        to the hope of which, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
        His people are begotten, is an inheritance which is incorruptible and
        undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven. This
        righteousness, then, is the ransom by which men are delivered from going
        down to the pit of everlasting destruction, and the price of heavenly
        and eternal glory. It is the fine linen, clean and white, in which the
        bride, the Lamb’s wife, shall be arrayed, ‘for the fine linen is the
        righteousness of saints.’ Man was made lower than the angels, but this
        righteousness exalts him above them. The redeemed people of God stand
        nearest to the throne, while the angels stand ‘round about’ them. They
        enter heaven clothed with a righteousness infinitely better than that
        which angels possess, or in which Adam was created.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea which some entertain, that the loss incurred by the fall is
        only compensated by what is obtained through the redemption that is in
        Christ Jesus, is so far from being just, that the super abounding of the
        gain is unspeakable and immense. By the disobedience of the first Adam,
        the righteousness with which he was originally invested was lost for
        himself and all his posterity, and the sin which he had committed was
        laid to their charge. By the obedience of the second Adam, not only the
        guilt of that one offense is removed, but pardon also is procured for
        all the personal transgressions of the children of God; while the
        righteousness, infinitely glorious, which He wrought, is placed to their
        account. By the entrance of sin and death, the inheritance on earth was
        forfeited. By the gift of the everlasting righteousness, their title to
        eternal glory in heaven is secured. And not as it was by one that
        sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but
        the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        For if by one man’s offense death reigned by one; much more they which
        receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign
        in life by one, Jesus Christ, ch. v. 16, 17.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evidence of the truth of Christianity might be rested on this one
        point —THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD provided for the salvation of sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could such an idea as that of a vicarious everlasting righteousness,
        to meet all the demands of aBROKEN LAW, have ever entered into the
        conception of men and angels? If it could have suggested itself to the
        highest created intelligence, and had the question been asked of all the
        host of heaven standing around the throne of God, ‘on His right hand and
        His left,’ Who shall work this righteousness? what answer could have
        been given? what expedient for its accomplishment could have been
        proposed by one or all of them together? All must have stood silent
        before their Maker. As no one in heaven, nor on earth, neither under the
        earth, was able to open the book with the seven seals, neither to look
        thereon, — which was a subject of such bitter lamentation to the beloved
        disciple, — so no one, neither man nor angel, nor all the elect angels
        together, could have wrought the righteousness necessary for the
        justification of a sinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        He alone who is Emmanuel, God with us, who alone could open that book
        and loose the seals thereof, could ‘bring in this everlasting
        righteousness,’ of which it may be truly said that eye had not seen it,
        nor ear heard it, neither had it entered into the heart of man, till God
        revealed it by His Spirit. Without law. — This righteousness is ‘the
        righteousness of God,’ and altogether independent of any obedience of
        man to law, more or less. As the righteousness of God is the perfect
        fulfillment which the law demands, it is evidently impossible that any
        other righteousness or obedience can be added to it or mixed with it. On
        the cross, Jesus Christ said, It is finished, — that is, it is
        perfected. To exhibit thisPERFECTION, this fulfillment of the law, this
        grand consummation, is the great object of the Apostle in the Epistle to
        the Hebrews, ch. <580601> 6:1. And Christ, it is said, Romans 10:4, is
        the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. In
        each of these passages the word used for ‘perfection,’ or ‘end,’ is, in
        the original, the same as the word ‘finished,’ used on the cross. And
        those persons are described as ignorant of God’s righteousness who go
        about to establish their own righteousness, and have not submitted
        themselves to the righteousness of God. ‘Without law,’ then, signifies,
        not without perfect obedience, but without any regard whatever to the
        obedience of man to the law. The obedience which the believer is enabled
        to render to the law has no part in his justification, nor could it
        justify, being always imperfect. The Apostle had, in the foregoing
        verse, affirmed that by his obedience to the law no man could be
        justified. He establishes the same truth in the 28th verse of this
        chapter, and in the fifth verse of the fourth chapter, in a manner so
        explicit, as to place his meaning beyond all question. In the same sense
        he declares, Galatians 3:21, that ‘if there had been a law given which
        could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the
        law.’ And again, he affirms, Galatians 2:21, ‘If righteousness come by
        the law, then Christ is dead in vain.’ It is needless here to dispute,
        as many do, about what law the Apostle alludes to, whether moral or
        ceremonial. It is to the law of God, whether written or unwritten, —
        whatever is sanctioned by His authority, whether ceremonial or moral, —
        all of which have been fulfilled by the righteousness of God, Matthew
        3:15.
      </p>
      <p>
        The righteousness of God is now manifested, — that is, clearly
        discovered, or made fully evident. It was darkly revealed in the shadows
        of the law, and more clearly in the writings of the Prophets; but now it
        is revealed in its accomplishment. It was manifested in the life and
        death of Jesus Christ, and was, by His resurrection from the dead,
        openly declared on the part of God. By Him, who was God manifest in the
        flesh, it was wrought out while He was on earth. He fulfilled all
        righteousness; not one jot of the law, either in its precepts or
        threatenings, passed from it; but all was accomplished; and of this
        righteousness the Holy Spirit, when He came, was to convince the world,
        John 16:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        This righteousness is manifested in the doctrine of the Apostles.
        Besides being introduced so frequently in this Epistle to the Romans, it
        is often referred to and exhibited in the other apostolical Epistles. To
        the Apostles was committed the ministration of the new dispensation
        characterized as the ‘ministration of righteousness,’ 2 Corinthians 3:9.
        By that dispensation, and not by the law, righteousness is come,
        Galatians 2:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        In writing to the Philippians, Paul calls it ‘the righteousness which is
        of God by faith, ’ and contrasts it with his own righteousness, which is
        of the law, Philippians 3:9. Peter addresses his Second Epistle to those
        who had obtained precious faith in the righteousness of our God and
        Savior Jesus Christ, 2 Peter 1:1. In one word, besides expressly naming
        it in many places under the designation of righteousness, the grand
        theme of the writings of the Apostles, as well as of their preaching,
        was the obedience and sufferings even unto death of the Lord Jesus
        Christ. Him they declared to be ‘the end of the law for righteousness to
        every one that believeth; ‘while they exposed the error of such as went
        about to establish their own righteousness, and did not submit
        themselves to the righteousness of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being witnessed by the law. — In the first part of this verse, ‘without
        law,’ where the article is wanting, signifies law indefinitely, —
        whatever has been delivered to man by God as His law, and in whatever
        way; but here, with the article, it refers to the five books of Moses,
        thus distinguished from the writings of the Prophets, according to the
        usual division of the Old Testament Scriptures, and adopted by our Lord,
        Luke 24:44. This righteousness was obscurely testified in the first
        promise respecting the bruising of the serpent’s head. It was expressly
        named in the declaration of the manner of Abraham’s justification, where
        it is recorded that he believed in the Lord, and He counted it to him
        for righteousness, Genesis 15:6; as also in the covenant which God made
        with him, of which the sign — that is, circumcision — was a seal or
        pledge of the righteousness which is by faith; and when it was promised
        that the blessing of Abraham, which is this righteousness, was to come
        on all nations; Genesis 12:3. It was intimated in the writings of Moses,
        in every declaration of the forgiveness of sin, and every call to
        repentance.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the declarations of mercy that are to be found in the law of Moses
        belong to the Gospel. They are all founded on the Messiah and His
        righteousness, and are made in consequence of God’s purpose to send His
        Son in the fullness of time into the world, and of the first promise
        respecting the seed of the woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        The righteousness of God was witnessed not only in all the declarations
        of mercy and calls to repentance, but also by the whole economy of the
        law of which Moses was the mediator. Abraham was chosen, his posterity
        collected into a nation, and a country appropriated to them, that from
        the midst of them, according to His promise, God might raise up a
        Prophet, who, like unto Moses, was to be a Lawgiver and Mediator, to
        whom, turning from Moses, they should listen so soon as He appeared,
        Deuteronomy 18:15,19. The law of everlasting obligation was given to
        that nation, and renewed after it had been broken by them, and then
        solemnly deposited in the ark of the testimony, in token that it should
        be preserved entire, and in due time fulfilled by him of whom the ark
        was a type.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sacrifices offered by the patriarchs, and the whole of the
        ceremonial law in all its typical ordinances and observances, bear their
        direct though shadowy testimony to the righteousness of God, of which
        Noah was alike a preacher and an heir, 2 Peter 2:5; Hebrews 11:7.
      </p>
      <p>
        The righteousness of God was witnessed by the Prophets. Of their
        testimonies to it the following are a few examples from the Psalms: —
        ’Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; and
        my tongue shall sing aloud of Thy righteousness.’ Psalm 51:14. ‘My mouth
        shall show forth Thy righteousness and Thy salvation all the day; for I
        know not the numbers thereof. I will go in the strength of the Lord God;
        I will make mention of Thy righteousness, even of Thine only. Thy
        righteousness, also, O God, is very high. My tongue also shall talk of
        Thy righteousness all the day long,’ Psalm 71:15,16,19,24. ‘Mercy and
        truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down
        from heaven. Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall set us in the
        way of His steps,’ Psalm 85:10,13. ‘In Thy name shall they rejoice all
        the day; and in Thy righteousness shall they be exalted,’ Psalm 89:16.
        ‘Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,’ <19B901> Psalm 119,
        142. ‘They shall abundantly utter the memory of Thy great goodness, and
        shall sing of Thy righteousness,’ <19E507> Psalm 145:7.
      </p>
      <p>
        The righteousness of the Messiah, as connected with salvation, is the
        constant theme of the Prophets, especially of Isaiah. ‘The Lord is well
        pleased for His righteousness’ sake; He will magnify the law, and make
        it honorable,’ Isaiah 42:21. ‘Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let
        the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them
        bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the
        Lord have created it,’ Isaiah 45:8. The heavens were to drop down this
        righteousness, and the skies were to pour it down, while men’s hearts,
        barren like the earth without rain, were to be opened to receive it by
        faith, having no part in doing anything to procure the gift. ‘Surely,
        shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength: In the
        Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory,’ Isaiah
        45:24,25. ‘I bring near My righteousness; it shall not be far off, and
        My salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for
        Israel My glory,’ Isaiah 46:13. ‘My righteousness is near; My salvation
        is gone forth — My salvation shall be for ever, and My righteousness
        shall not be abolished. Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness, ’
        Isaiah 51:5,7. ‘By His knowledge shall My righteous servant justify
        many,’ Isaiah 61:11. ‘This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord,
        and their righteousness is of Me, saith the Lord,’ Isaiah 54:17. ‘Thus
        saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for My salvation is
        near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed,’ Isaiah 56:1. ‘For as
        the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things
        that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord God will cause
        righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations,’ Isaiah
        61:11. ‘For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s
        sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as
        brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth And the
        Gentiles shall see Thy righteousness, and all kings Thy glory,’ Isaiah
        62:1,2. ‘Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto
        David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall
        execute judgment and justice in the earth. In His days Judah shall be
        saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is His name whereby He
        shall be called, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS,’ Jeremiah 23:5. ‘Seventy
        weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish
        the transgression, and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation
        for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteous, ’ Daniel 9:24. ‘It
        is time to seek the Lord, till He come and rain righteousness upon you,’
        Hosea 10:12. ‘But unto you that fear My name shall the Sun of
        righteousness arise with healing in His wings,’ Malachi 4:2. To Balaam,
        who beheld the Savior at a distance, He appeared as a star; ‘ There
        shall come a Star out of Jacob,’ Numbers 24:17; while to Malachi, the
        last of the Prophets, on His nearer approach, He appeared as the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — When the righteousness of and, which is by faith of Jesus
        Christ unto all and upon all their that believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This righteousness of God, to which the law and the Prophets render
        their testimony, and which is now manifested in the Gospel, whereby man
        is justified, is not imputed to him on account of any work of his own in
        obedience to the law, but is received, as the Apostle had already
        declared in the 17th verse of chapter first, by faith alone. Faith is no
        part of that righteousness; but it is through faith that it is received,
        and becomes available for salvation. Faith is the belief of the Divine
        testimony concerning that righteousness, and trust in Him who is its
        Author. Faith perceives and acknowledges the excellency and suitableness
        of God’s righteousness, and cordially embraces it. ‘Faith is the
        substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen;’
        because, though we do not yet possess what God has promised, and do not
        yet see it accomplished in ourselves, we see it accomplished in Jesus
        Christ, in whom what we hope for really exists. In respect to the
        promises not yet fulfilled, believers are now in the same situation as
        the fathers were of old respecting the unaccomplished promises in their
        day. Like them, they see these promises afar off, are persuaded of them,
        and embrace them. Believers thus flee to Christ and His righteousness as
        the refuge set before them in the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        By faith they receive Him as their surety, and place their trust in Him,
        as representing them on the cross, in His death, and in His
        resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we can have a right to anything in Christ, we must be one with
        Him; we must be joined with Him as our head, being dead to the law and
        married to Him; and as this union is accomplished through faith, His
        righteousness, which we receive, and which becomes ours in this way, is
        therefore called the righteousness which is by faith of Jesus Christ,
        Romans 3:22; the righteousness of faith, Romans 4:11,13; and the
        righteousness which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
        which is of God by faith, Philippians 3:9. It is called the
        righteousness of faith, because faith is the only instrument which God
        is pleased to employ in applying His righteousness. It is not called the
        righteousness of any other grace but of faith; we never read of the
        righteousness of repentance, of humility, of meekness, or of charity.
        These are of great price in the sight of God, but they have no office in
        justifying a sinner. This belongs solely to faith; for to him that
        worketh not, but believeth, is righteousness imputed; and faith is the
        gift of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        This righteousness is unto all. — It is set before all, and proclaimed
        to all, according to the commandment of our blessed Lord, — ’ Go ye into
        all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.’ Upon all, is
        connected with the words that follow, viz., them that believe. While it
        is proclaimed to all men, it is actually upon believers. It is not put
        into them, as their sanctification is brought in the soul by the Holy
        Spirit; but it is placed upon them as a robe: — ’He hath covered me with
        the robe of righteousness, ’ Isaiah 61:10. It is the white raiment given
        by Jesus Christ to them who hear His voice, that they may be clothed,
        and that the shame of their nakedness may not appear, Revelation 3:18.
        It is the fine linen, clean and white, with which the bride, the Lamb’s
        wife, is arrayed; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints,
        Revelation 19:8. Thus Jesus Christ is made of God, to them that are in
        Him, righteousness, Corinthians 1:30. Righteousness. — ’ This,
        doubtless, is meant,’ says Archbishop Leighton, in his sermon on 1
        Corinthians 1:30, ‘of the righteousness by which we are justified before
        God; and He is made this to us, applied by faith: his righteousness
        becomes ours. That exchange made, our sins are laid over upon Him, and
        His obedience put upon us. This, the great glad tidings, that we are
        made righteous by Christ: It is not a righteousness wrought by us, but
        given to us, and put upon us. This, carnal reason cannot apprehend, and,
        being proud, therefore rejects and argues against it, and says, how can
        this thing be? But faith closes with it, and rejoices in it; without
        either doing or suffering, the sinner is acquitted and justified, and
        stands as guiltless of breach, yea, as having fulfilled the whole law.
        And happy they that thus fasten upon this righteousness — they may lift
        up their faces with gladness and boldness before God: whereas the most
        industrious self-saving justiciary, though in other men’s eyes, and his
        own, possibly, for the present, he makes a glistering show, yet when he
        shall come to be examined of God, and tried according to the law, he
        shall be covered with shame, and confounded in his folly and guiltiness.
        But faith triumphs over self-unworthiness, and sin, and death, and the
        law; shrouding the soul under the mantle of Jesus Christ; and there it
        is safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        All accusations fall off, having nowhere to fasten, unless some blemish
        could be found in that righteousness in which faith hath wrapt itself.
        This is the very spring of solid peace, and fills the soul with peace
        and joy. But still men would have something within themselves to make
        out the matter, as if this robe needed any such piecing, and not finding
        what they desire, thence disquiet and unsettlement of mind arise! True
        it is that faith purifies the heart and works holiness, and all graces
        flow from it: But in this work of justifying the sinner it is alone, and
        cannot admit of any mixture.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — (For there is no difference; For all have sinned, and come
        short of the glory of God.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle introduces this parenthesis to preclude the supposition that
        the receiving of the righteousness of God is not indispensably necessary
        to every individual of the human race in order to his salvation, and
        lest it should be imagined that there is any difference in the way in
        which, or on account of which, it is received. As there is no difference
        between Jews and Gentiles with respect to their character as sinners, so
        there is no difference with respect to them as to the receiving of God’s
        righteousness — no difference either as to sin or salvation — all of
        them are guilty, and salvation through faith is published to them all.
        ‘For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the same
        Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him,’ Romans 10:12. Before
        men receive this righteousness, they are all under the curse of the
        broken law, and in a state of condemnation. Whatever distinction there
        may be among them otherwise, whether moral in their conduct, good and
        useful members of society, discharging respectably and decently the
        external duties of that situation in which they are placed, or having a
        zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, and going about to
        establish their own righteousness, — or whether they be immoral in their
        lives, entirely abandoned to every vice, — they all stand equally in
        need of this righteousness — it is equally preached to them all — it is
        in the same manner bestowed upon all who believe. The reason of this is,
        that all have sinned — all, without one exception, as had been proved,
        are ‘under sin.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle adds, as a consequence of this, that they have come short of
        the glory of God. They have come short, as in running a race, having now
        lost all strength ( Romans 5:6) and ability in themselves to glorify
        God, and attain to the possession and enjoyment of His glory. In the
        second chapter, the Apostle, in announcing the terms of the law, had
        declared that the way to obtain eternal life was in seeking for glory by
        patient continuance in well-doing, and that to those who work good,
        honor and peace would be awarded. In other words, ‘if thou wilt enter
        into life, keep the commandments; ‘but he had afterwards proved that in
        this way it was altogether unattainable, since by the deeds of the law
        no flesh shall be justified. In this place he more briefly repeats the
        same truth, that all men, without exception, being sinners, have come
        short of this glory, while he is pointing out the way in which, through
        the atonement of the Savior, and faith in that atonement, believers may
        now ‘rejoice in hope of the glory of God.’ All men, on the ground of
        their obedience to law, come short of glorifying God, for to glorify God
        is the whole of the law, — even the second table is to be obeyed to
        glorify God, who requires it. If they come short of obeying the law,
        they have, as sinners, come short of that glory, and honor, and
        immortality, in His presence, which can only be obtained through the
        ‘salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory,’ Timothy 2:10.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — Being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption
        that is in Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justified. — Justification stands opposed both to accusation and
        condemnation. ‘Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It
        is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth?’ ‘Them whom God
        effectually calleth, He also freely justifieth; not by infusing
        righteousness into them,’ as is well expressed in the Westminster
        Confession of Faith, ‘but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and
        accepting their persons as righteous, — not for anything wrought in
        them, or done by them, but for Christ’s sake alone; not by imputing
        faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience,
        to them as their righteousness; but by imputing the obedience and
        satisfaction of Christ unto them, they receiving and resting on Him and
        His righteousness by faith; which faith they have not of themselves, it
        is the gift of God.’ Or, according to Dr. Owen On Justification, ‘This
        imputation is an act of God, ex mera gratia , of His mere love and
        grace, whereby, on the consideration of the mediation of Christ, He
        makes an effectual grant and donation of a true, real, perfect
        righteousness — even that of Christ Himself — unto all that do believe,
        and accounting it as theirs, on His own gracious act, both absolves them
        from sin, and granteth them right and title unto eternal life.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Helvetic Confession of Faith, adopted by the church at Geneva in
        1536, and by all the evangelical churches in Switzerland thirty years
        afterwards, explains justification as follows: — ’The word, to justify,
        signifies, in the writings of the Apostle St. Paul, when he speaks of
        justification, to pardon sins, to absolve from guilt and punishment, to
        receive into grace, and to declare righteous. The righteousness of Jesus
        Christ is imputed to believers. — Our Savior is then charged with the
        sins of the world, He has taken them away, He has satisfied Divine
        justice. It is, then, only on account of Jesus Christ, dead and risen,
        that God, pacified towards us, does not impute to us our sins, but that
        He imputes to us the righteousness of his Son, as if it were ours; so
        that thenceforward, we are not only cleansed from our sins, but,
        besides, clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and by it absolved
        from the punishment of sins, from death, or from condemnation, accounted
        righteous, and heirs of eternal life. Thus, to speak properly, it is God
        only who justifies us, and He justifies us solely for the sake of Jesus
        Christ, not imputing to us our sins, but imputing to us the
        righteousness of Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Homily of the Church of England, on ‘justification,’ it is said —
        ’Justification is not the office of man, but of God; for man cannot make
        himself righteous by his own works, neither in part nor in whole; for
        that were the greatest arrogancy and presumption of man that Antichrist
        could set up against God, to affirm that a man might, by his own works,
        take away and purge his own sins, and so justify himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        But justification is the office of God only, and is not a thing which we
        render unto Him, but which we receive of Him; not which we give to Him,
        but which we take of Him by His free mercy, and by the only merits of
        His most dearly beloved Son, our only Redeemer, Savior, and Justifier,
        Jesus Christ: So that the true understanding of this doctrine, we be
        justified freely by faith without works, or that we be justified by
        Christ only, is not that this our own act to believe in Christ, or this
        our faith in Christ which is within us doth justify us, and deserve our
        justification unto us (for that were to count ourselves to be justified
        by some act or virtue that is within ourselves), but the true
        understanding and meaning thereof is, that although we hear God’s word,
        and believe it, although we have faith, hope, charity, repentance,
        dread, and fear of God within us, do never so many works thereunto; yet
        we must renounce the merit of all our said virtues, of faith, hope,
        charity, and all other virtues, which we either have done, shall do, or
        can do, as things that must be far too weak, and insufficient, and
        imperfect; to deserve remission of our sins and our justification; and
        therefore we must trust only in God’s mercy, and that sacrifice which
        our High Priest and Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God, once offered
        for us on the cross.’ Again, ‘This doctrine all old and ancient authors
        of Christ’s Church do approve. This doctrine adorneth and setteth forth
        the glory of Christ, and beateth down the glory of man; this whosoever
        denieth, is not to be accounted for a Christian man, nor for a setter
        forth of Christ’s glory, but for an adversary of Christ and His Gospel,
        and for a setter forth of man’s vain glory.’ The above quotations are
        not given in the way of authority, but as expressing the truth, and
        evincing the unanimity of believers of different communions on this
        all-important point. The sum of them is, that believers are absolved
        from condemnation, and entitled to eternal life, by the free and
        sovereign favor of God as its original first moving cause, without any
        desert in themselves, but solely in virtue of the righteousness of
        Christ, which includes an infinitely valuable price of redemption, a
        price that was paid for them by His obedience and sufferings to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no ‘condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.’ The moment
        a sinner is united to Him, the sentence of condemnation under which he
        formerly lay, is remitted, and a sentence of justification is pronounced
        by God. Justification, then, is at once complete — in the imputation of
        a perfect righteousness, the actual pardon of all past sins, the virtual
        pardon of future sins, and the grant and title to the heavenly
        inheritance. The believer is found in Christ having the righteousness
        which is of God, Philippians 3:9. ‘Surely, shall one say, in the Lord
        have I righteousness, ’ Isaiah 45:24. He is complete in Christ,
        Colossians 2:10, who, by one offering, hath for ever perfected him,
        Hebrews 10:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Him the law has been fulfilled, Romans 8:4; his sin has been made
        Christ’s, and the righteousness which God requireth by the law has been
        made his. ‘He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
        might be made the righteousness of God in Him,’ 2 Corinthians 5:21.
      </p>

        On this passage Chrysostom remarks, ‘What word, what speech is this?
        what mind can comprehend or express it? For He saith, He made Him who
        was righteous to be made a sinner, that He might make sinners righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor yet doth He say so neither, but that which is far more sublime and
        excellent. For He speaks not of an inclination or affection, but
        expresseth the quality itself. For He says not, He made him a sinner,
        but sin, that we might be made not merely righteous, but righteousness —
        and that the righteousness of God.’ When we are here said to be made the
        righteousness of God in Him, the meaning is, that we are made righteous
        in such a degree as admits of no addition. We could not be more
        righteous if our whole nature and constitution were made up of this one
        attribute, and there were nothing in us or about us but righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Lord Jesus Christ condescended to take on Him our sins, it
        would not have been just for Him not to account for them; His
        responsibility for them was then the same as if He had Himself sinned.
        On this proceeded God’s treatment of Him in hiding His face from Him,
        till the debt was paid. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the
        law, being made a curse for us; that is, being cursed, as the Apostle
        explains it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the sins of Israel were all laid on the head of the scapegoat, so
        ‘the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.’ ‘How could He die,’
        says Charnock, ‘if He was not a reputed sinner? Had He not first had a
        relation to our sin, He could not in justice have undergone our
        punishment. He must, in the order of justice, be supposed a sinner
        really, or by imputation. Really He was not; by imputation, then, He
        was.’ On the whole, believers are accounted and pronounced righteous by
        God; and if so accounted by Him, it is and must be true in fact that
        they are righteous, for righteousness is imputed to them; that is, it is
        placed to their account — made over to them, because really theirs —
        and, therefore, without the smallest deviation from truth or fact —
        which is impossible in the great Judge — he will, from His throne of
        judgment in the last day, pronounce them ‘righteous, ’ Matthew 25:37,46.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plan of salvation through the righteousness of Jesus Christ is so
        deep and astonishing an instance of Divine wisdom, that while it is not
        at all perceived by the wisdom of the world, it even in some measure
        lies hid from those who are savingly enlightened by it. Many Christians
        are afraid to give the scriptural language on this subject the full
        extent of its meaning; and instead of representing themselves as being
        made righteous, perfectly righteous; by the righteousness of the Son of
        Gods they look on their justification as merely an accounting of them as
        righteous while they are not so in reality. They think that God
        mercifully looks on them in a light which is more favorable than the
        strictness of truth will warrant. But the Scriptures represent believers
        as truly righteous, possessing a righteousness fully answerable to all
        the demands of the law. By their union with Christ they are ‘dead to
        sin,’ and the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in them, ch. 8:4.
        They have paid its penalty and fulfilled its utmost demands, and are
        ‘made the righteousness of God in Him.’ God never accounts any one to be
        what he is not in reality; and as Christ righteousness is reckoned ours
        as well as Adam’s sin, believers ought to consider themselves as truly
        righteous in Christ as they are truly guilty in Adam. These two facts
        mutually reflect light on each other. Adam was the figure of Christ, and
        our sin in Adam is perfectly analogous to our righteousness in Christ,
        ‘For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
        obedience of one shall many be made righteous,’ ch. 5:19. Freely by his
        grace. — The expression is redoubled, to show that all is of God, and
        that nothing in this act of justification belongs to, or proceeds from
        man. It is perfectly gratuitous on the part of God, both as to the mode
        of conveyance and the motive on which it is vouchsafed. Nothing being
        required of man in order to his justification, in the way of price or
        satisfaction, and there being no prerequisite or preparatory
        dispositions to merit it at the hand of God, believers are therefore
        said to be justified by His grace, which excludes on their part both
        price and merit. And lest it should be imagined that grace does not
        proceed in its operation, as well as in the choice of its objects,
        consistently with its character of sovereign and unmerited goodness, the
        Apostle adds the word freely; that is, without cause or motive on the
        part of man. The word here rendered ‘freely’ is the same as that used by
        our Lord when He says, they hated Me without a cause, John 15:25.
        ‘Freely’ (gratuitously) ye have receded, freely give, Matthew 10:8; 2
        Corinthians 11:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:8; ‘For naught’ (gratis), Revelation
        21:6, and 22:17; or without price, as Isaiah 55:1. This term ‘freely’ in
        the most absolute manner excludes all consideration of anything in man
        as the cause or condition of his justification. The means by which it is
        received is faith; and, in the commencement of the next chapter, faith
        is placed in opposition to all works whatever, and in verse 16th of that
        chapter it is said, ‘Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by
        grace.’ Faith is the constituted medium through which man receives ‘the
        gift of righteousness;’ because, as Paul there affirms, it interferes
        not with the gratuitous nature of the gift. It is impossible to express
        more strongly than in this place, that justification is bestowed without
        the smallest regard to anything done by man. It cannot be pretended that
        it comes in consequence of repentance, or anything good either existing
        or foreseen in him. God ‘justifieth the ungodly,’ Romans 4:5. It comes,
        then, solely by grace — free, unmerited favor. ‘And if by grace, then it
        is no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace,’ Romans 11:6.
        This is said respecting the election of believers to eternal life, and
        equally holds, according to the passage before us, in respect to their
        justification. Speaking of the advocates of human merit, ‘What can they
        say,’ observes Luther, in answer to Erasmus, ‘to the declaration of St.
        Paul? Being justified freely by His grace. Freely, what does that word
        mean? How are good endeavors and merit consistent with a gratuitous
        donation? Perhaps you do not insist on a merit of condignity, but only
        of congruity. Empty distinctions. How does Paul in one word confound in
        one mass all the assertors of every species and of every degree of
        merit?
      </p>
      <p>
        All are justified freely, and without, the works of the law. He who
        affirms the justification of all men who are justified to be perfectly
        free and gratuitous, leaves no place for works, merits, or preparations
        of any kind — no place for works either of condignity or congruity; and
        thus, at one blow, he demolishes both the Pelagians with their complete
        merits, and our sophists with their petty performances.’ Through the
        redemption that is in Christ Jesus. — The great blessing of
        justification is described above as proceeding from the free grace of
        God, which is the fountain from whence flow pardon, righteousness, and
        salvation, excluding all works, whether before or after faith. Here it
        is referred to the meritorious price provided by God, and that is the
        redemption which is in Christ Jesus For though it comes freely to man,
        yet it is through the redemption or purchase of the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word redemption signifies a buying back, and necessarily supposes an
        alienation of what is redeemed. In general, it imports a deliverance
        effected by a price, and sometimes a deliverance by power. In this last
        sense it is said, ‘Now these are Thy servants, and Thy people, whom Thou
        hast redeemed by Thy great power,’ Nehemiah 1:10. ‘I will redeem you
        with a stretched out arm,’ Exodus 6:6; Psalm 77:15. The resurrection of
        the body by an act of Divine power is called a redemption, Psalm 49:15;
        Romans 8:23. But, more generally, redemption signifies, in Scripture,
        deliverance by price, as that of slaves, or prisoners, or persons
        condemned, when they are delivered from slavery, captivity, or death, by
        means of a ransom. The word is here used in this last acceptation. Man
        had rebelled against God, and incurred the just condemnation of His law;
        but God, by His free grace, and of infinite compassion, hath substituted
        His own Son in the place of the guilty, and transferred from them to Him
        the obligation of their punishment. He hath made Him to suffer and die
        for their sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring them to
        Himself. ‘His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree,’ 1
        Peter 3:18, 2:24. In this manner the Scriptures represent the blood or
        death of Jesus Christ as the ransom price. He came to give His life a
        ransom for many, Matthew 20:28; 1 Corinthians 6:20. ‘Ye were not
        redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
        conversation, received by tradition from your fathers, but with the
        precious blood of Christ,’ 1 Peter 1:18. ‘Thou wast slain, and hast
        redeemed us to God by Thy blood,’ Revelation 5:9. ‘Having predestinated
        us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according
        to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His
        grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the Beloved; in whom we have
        redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the
        riches of His grace, wherein He hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
        and prudence,’ Ephesians 1:5-8; Colossians 1:14. If, then, we are
        accounted righteous before God, because redeemed with a price paid by
        another, we receive what is not in ourselves, or in any measure from
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        In every place in Scripture where our redemption in Christ is mentioned,
        there is an allusion to the law of redemption among the Jews. This law
        is contained in the Book of Leviticus, ch. 25, where we and regulations
        laid down for a twofold redemption, a redemption of persons and a
        redemption of possessions. The redemption of possessions or inheritances
        is regulated, verses 23-28, and that of persons, from verse 47 to the
        end of the chapter. In both these cases, none had a right to redeem but
        either the person himself who had made the alienation, or some other
        that was near of kin to him. But none of Adam’s family ever was, or ever
        will be, able to redeem himself or others. ‘None of them can by any
        means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; for the
        redemption of their soul is precious,’ Psalm 49:7. It is too precious to
        be accomplished by such means; and had there been no other, it would
        have ‘ceased for ever.’ All mankind had been engaged in a warfare
        against God, and, as rebels, were condemned to death. Satan had taken
        the whole human race captive, and employed them in the drudgery of sin.
        From the sentence of death and the slavery of sin, it was impossible for
        any of them ever to have been set free, if Christ had not paid the
        ransom of His blood. But He, the Son of God, having from all eternity
        undertaken the work of redemption of those whom God gave Him, and being
        substituted by the everlasting covenant which God made with Him in their
        place, the right of redemption was vested in Him, by virtue of His
        covenant relation to them. And that nothing might be wanting either to
        constitute Him their legal kinsman-Redeemer, or to evidence Him to be
        so, He took on Him their nature, and in that nature paid their ransom to
        the last mite. Thus He performs the part of the Redeemer of His people,
        redeeming them from slavery and from death, and redeeming for them that
        inheritance which they had forfeited, and which they could not redeem
        for themselves. In some cases both these sorts of redemption were
        conjoined, and the person redeemed was espoused to him who redeemed her;
        and in this manner our Lord Jesus Christ has redeemed His Church. Having
        redeemed the heavenly inheritance for her, He has at the same time
        redeemed her from her state of bondage, and has betrothed her to
        Himself. ‘I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee
        unto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and
        in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; and thou
        shalt know the Lord,’ Hosea 2:19,20.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Socinian talks of redemption as an act merely of God’s power, and of
        Christ as offering His sacrifice by presenting Himself in heaven after
        His death. But this is not redemption. There is not only a price paid,
        but that price is expressly stated. ‘In whom we have redemption through
        His blood.’ His blood, then, is the price by which we have redemption,
        ‘even the forgiveness of sins,’ Colossians 1:14. The same thing that is
        redemption, is in another point of view forgiveness; yet these two
        things in human transactions are incompatible. Where there is
        forgiveness, there is no price or redemption; where there is redemption
        there is no forgiveness. But in the salvation of the Gospel there are
        both. There is a price; but as God Himself has paid the price, it is
        forgiveness with respect to man, as much as if there had been no price.
        How wonderful is the wisdom of God manifested in the Gospel! Grace and
        justice, mercy and punishment, are blended together in the most perfect
        harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many seem to think that nothing can be essentially wrong in the views of
        those who speak of gratuitous salvation. Yet this may be most explicitly
        confessed, and the distinguishing features of the Gospel overlooked or
        even denied. Arians do not deny a gratuitous salvation. They contend
        that salvation is gratuitous, and boast that they are the only persons
        who consistently hold this doctrine. Calvinists, they say, have not a
        God of mercy: He gives nothing without a price. Their God they boast, is
        a God of mercy; for He pardons without any ransom. Now the glory of the
        Gospel is, that grace reigns through righteousness. Salvation is of
        grace; but this grace comes to us in a way ofRIGHTEOUSNESS. It is grace
        to us; but it was brought about in such a way that all our debt was
        paid. This exhibits God as just, as well as merciful. Just; in requiring
        full compensation to justice; and merciful, because it was He, and not
        the sinner, who provided the ransom. He who is saved, is saved without
        an injury to justice. Salvation is in one point of view forgiveness, but
        in another it is redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, however, it is urged, that though it is here said that God
        justifies man freely by His grace, yet, as a price has been paid for it,
        this takes away from the freeness of the gift. But He who pays the
        ransom is one and the same, as has just been observed, with Him who
        justifies; so that the freeness of the blessing on the part of God is
        not in the smallest degree diminished. This proves that the doctrine of
        a free justification, through an atonement, rests entirely on the
        doctrine of the deity of Jesus Christ; on which also rests the transfer
        of His righteousness to the guilty; for, as has already been shown, no
        mere creature can have the least particle of merit to transfer to
        another. Every creature is bound for himself to fulfill the whole law.
        After doing all that is possible for him in the way of obedience, he
        must confess himself to be an unprofitable servant, Luke 17:10.
      </p>
      <p>
        This redemption is in, or by, Christ Jesus. — It is wholly in Him, and
        solely accomplished by Him. Through the period of His ministry on earth,
        His disciples who followed Him were not aware of the work He was
        accomplishing. During His agony in the garden they were asleep. When
        seized by His persecutors to be put to death, they all forsook Him and
        fled. ‘Behold,’ says He, ‘the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye
        shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave Me alone.’ No
        one participated or bore any share with Him in that great work, which,
        according to His appeal to His Father, on which He founded the petitions
        He offered for Himself and His people, He alone had consummated: ‘I have
        gloried Thee on the earth: I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me
        to do.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — When God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
        His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that
        are past, through the forbearance of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end of the preceding verse, the Apostle had said that believers
        are justified freely by the grace of God, through the redemption that is
        in Christ Jesus. This redemption he here further explains. God hath set
        forth His Son to be a propitiatory sacrifice to make satisfaction to His
        justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression, set forth, means to exhibit to public view — to place
        before the eyes of men — to manifest, — according as it is said, ‘Who
        verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was
        manifested in these last times for you,’ 1 Peter 1:20. To be a
        propitiation. — Some understand this as meaning a propitiatory,
        signifying the mercy-seat, as the same word is translated, Hebrews 9:5;
        some as a propitiatory sacrifice, which is to be preferred. But it comes
        to the same thing, if, according to our translation, it be rendered
        propitiation, considering the word to be the adjective taken
        substantively. And this is countenanced by 1 John 2:2, and 4:10, though
        a different word is employed, but of the same derivation. By a
        propitiation is meant that which appeareth the wrath of God for sins and
        obtains His favor, as it is said, Hebrews 2:17, where the corresponding
        verb is used, to make reconciliation for (to propitiate) the sins of the
        people; and ‘God be merciful to me a sinner.’ He was thus pacified
        towards believers in Jesus Christ, and made favorable to them, the
        demands of His law and justice being satisfied, and every obstruction to
        the exercise of His mercy towards them removed. This propitiation of
        Christ was typified by the propitiatory sacrifices whose blood was shed,
        and by the mercy-seat, which was called the propitiatory, that
        illustrious type of Christ and His work, covering the ark in which the
        law to be fulfilled by Him was deposited, and on it, and before it, the
        blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled by the high priest. Through faith
        in His blood. — This propitiation was made by blood, by which is to be
        understood all the sufferings of Christ, and, above all, His death, by
        which they were consummated. And this becomes a propitiation to us
        through faith in His blood, — that is, when we believe that His death is
        a sacrifice which make atonement for us, and when we rest on it as a
        sufficient answer to all accusations against us of the law of God, which
        in the punishment of death it demanded for sin, for ‘without shedding of
        blood is no remission.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression, ‘through faith in His blood,’ limits to believers the
        effect of this propitiation. f19 God hath not only set forth His Son to
        be a propitiatory sacrifice, to be available through faith in His blood,
        but also hath done this to declare or manifest His righteousness.
        Righteousness. — Some here translate this word faithfulness, or the
        righteousness of the character of God, or veracity; some goodness; some
        holiness; some pardoning mercy. But all are wrong, and such translations
        are opposed to the sense of the passage. It is righteousness, namely,
        the righteousness of God, on account of which the Gospel is the power of
        God unto salvation, ch. 1:17, to which the Apostle had recurred in the
        21st and 22nd verses of this chapter, declaring that it is now
        manifested. ‘Righteousness’ in the above passages is the same as in the
        one before us, and in the following verse. In the 21st and 22nd verses,
        the expression employed is the ‘righteousness of God;’ and in this and
        the following verse, ‘His righteousness.’ Is it then to be supposed
        that, in repeating the same expression four times in the same breath,
        and with a view to establish the same truth, the Apostle used it in
        various senses, — first, as that righteousness which fulfills the law
        which God has provided for sinners; and then as the faithfulness, or
        goodness, or holiness, or mercy, or justice of God, or the righteousness
        of His character? — ideas entirely different from the former. That the
        meaning of the expression, ‘His righteousness,’ is the same in this and
        the following verse as that of the ‘righteousness of God’ in verses 21,
        22, appears unquestionable, from the reason given in this 25th verse for
        setting forth Jesus Christ to be a propitiation for sin. This, as is
        twice repeated, first here, and then in the following verse, was for the
        purpose of declaring or manifesting God’s righteousness. In the 21st
        verse it is asserted that the righteousness of God is now manifested;
        and in the 25th verse it is shown in what way it is now manifested,
        namely, by setting forth Christ as a propitiation for sin; and in the
        following verse the reason is given, namely, for what purpose it is now
        manifested. On the whole, then, notwithstanding that a different sense
        is generally affixed to it by commentators, it appears clear that the
        signification of the expression ‘righteousness’ is the same in each of
        these four verses, which stand in so close a connection. This
        signification being the same in all the above instances, and generally
        in the various other places in the Epistle, in which it so often occurs,
        entirely corresponds with the whole tenor of the Apostle’s discourse,
        which is to prove that a perfect righteousness is provided by God for
        man, who has lost his own righteousness, and on which he had so forcibly
        dwelt throughout the first and second chapters, and down to the 21st
        verse of the chapter before us. For the remission of sins that are past;
        — rather, as to, or with regard to, the passing by of sins before
        committed. Jesus Christ hath been set forth by God to be a propitiatory
        sacrifice, by which He brought in ‘everlasting righteousness,’ and by
        which it is now publicly manifested. On account, then, of this
        righteousness, even before it was introduced, God pardoned or remitted
        the sins of His people under the Old Testament dispensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        These, having received the promises, although their accomplishment was
        yet afar off, were persuaded of them and embraced them; thus exercising
        faith in the blood of that great propitiatory sacrifice which was
        typified by the legal sacrifices, and through this faith they received
        the remission of their sins. Through the forbearance of God. — It was
        owing to God’s forbearance that He passed by the sins of His people
        before the death of Christ, till which time His law was not honored, and
        His justice had received no satisfaction. No sufficient atonement
        previous to that event was made for their sins, yet, through the
        forbearance of God, He did not immediately proceed to punish them, but
        had respect to the everlasting righteousness to be brought in, in the
        fullness of time, Daniel 9:24, by the propitiatory sacrifice of His Son,
        by which their sins were to be expiated. This verse beautifully
        indicates the ground on which Old Testament saints were admitted into
        heaven before the death of Christ.

        The same truth is declared in the Epistle to the Hebrews 9:15, where the
        Apostle refers to the inefficacy of the legal sacrifices to take away
        sins, and speaks of the blood of Jesus, by which He entered into the
        holy place, and obtained eternal redemption for His people. ‘And for
        this cause He is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of
        death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
        first testament, they which are called (literally the called) might
        receive the promise of eternal inheritance.’ All the people on whom the
        blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled, were sanctified to the purifying
        of the flesh, but those of them who were efficaciously called, and
        offered the sacrifices in faith of the promise of God, received a real
        remission of their sins. They were, like Noah, heirs of the
        righteousness which is by faith, and consequently partakers in its
        benefits. To the same purpose the Apostle speaks towards the end of that
        Epistle, of ‘the spirits of just men made perfect, ’ Hebrews 12:23. They
        had entered heaven on the pledge of that righteousness which was
        afterwards to be wrought; but until that took place, their title to
        heavenly glory had not been completed or perfected. f20 Hence the
        declaration at the end of the eleventh chapter of that Epistle, ‘that
        they without us should not be made perfect,’ that is, without the
        introduction of that righteousness in the days of the Gospel, the
        ministration of which was committed to the Apostles, 2 Corinthians 3:3.

      <p>
        Ver. 26. — To declare, I say at this time His righteousness; that He
        might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        God hath at this time also set forth His Son as a propitiatory
        sacrifice, in order to make manifest His righteousness, on account of
        which now, under the Gospel dispensation, He remits the sins of His
        people. He was always just in forgiving sin, but now the ground on which
        He forgives it is manifested, which vindicates His justice in doing so.
        The word here rendered just, is variously translated by those who do not
        understand God’s plan of salvation. Some make it to signify benevolent,
        kind, merciful, etc.; but it has here its own proper meaning, which it
        never deserts. God is just; He acts according to strict justice, as
        becometh His character, while He justifies, accounts, and treats as
        perfectly righteous all who believe in Jesus, who are thus one with Him,
        and consequently have His righteousness imputed to them. In all this we
        see the accomplishment of that prediction, ‘Mercy and truth are met
        together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall
        spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
        Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield
        her increase. Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall set us in the
        way of His steps,’ Psalm 85:10.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the last two verses we learn that, in the continuance of the legal
        dispensation, not with standing the sins of men, and also in the
        preservation of the nations, God had suspended the immediate effects of
        His justice. For if He had not acted in this manner, He would at once
        have put an end to that dispensation and to the economy of His
        providence with respect to the other nations in destroying both them and
        the people of Israel. During all that time which preceded the coming of
        His Son, He appeared to have forgotten the merited punishment of men’s
        sins, and all the world remained under the shadow of His forbearance.
        But when Jesus Christ came, God did two things: the first was to
        continue no longer an economy of patience, or of an apparent
        forgetfulness of sin, bat to bring in everlasting righteousness, by
        which He bestowed a true justification, which the law, whether written
        or natural, could not do, as it left men under guilt; but Jesus Christ
        has brought the true grace of God. The second thing which God has done,
        is to manifest, in the revelation of His righteousness, His avenging
        justice, by the shedding of the blood of His Son upon the cross. And
        thus he now appears to be just in Himself as the real avenger of sins,
        and, at the same time, the justifier of men, granting them a real
        remission of their sins by the imputation of His righteousness, which
        answers every demand of law and justice; whereas in the period of the
        forbearance of God, which continued to the time of Jesus Christ, God
        neither appeared just nor justifying. He did not appear just, for He
        suspended the effects of His justice. He did not appear the justifier,
        for He seemed only to suspend for a time the punishment of sins, and to
        leave men under the obligation of that punishment. But in the economy of
        Jesus Christ He manifests Himself both as just and as the justifier, for
        He displays the awful effects of His justice in the person of His Son in
        the work of propitiation, in the shedding of His blood; and, at the same
        time, He justifies His people, granting to them a true remission of
        their sins.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when the greatness of Him by whom this expiation was made is
        considered, the glory of the Divine justice, as exhibited in His death,
        is elevated in the highest possible degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the propitiation, then, of Jesus Christ, the justice of God in the
        salvation of sinners shines conspicuously. No man hath seen God at any
        time; the only-begotten Son hath in His own person revealed Him. Jesus
        Christ was set forth to display every attribute of Godhead. The wisdom
        and power of God are seen in the constitution and person of Christ and
        His work, incomparably more fully than in the creation of the heavens
        and the earth. Perfect justice, mercy, and love to sinners, are beheld
        nowhere else. Here God is revealed as infinite in mercy ; not so the God
        of man’s imagination, whose mercy is a mixture of injustice and weak
        compassion, and extends only to those who are supposed to deserve it.
        But in the incarnate God infinite mercy is extended to the chief of
        sinners. Here is pure mercy without merit on the part of man. And where
        do we find the perfection of Divine justice? Not in the God of man’s
        imagination, where justice is tempered with mercy, and limited in a
        thousand ways. Not even in the eternal punishment of the wicked shall we
        find justice so fully displayed as in the propitiation of Jesus Christ.
        He gave justice all it could demand, so that it is now shown to have
        secured the salvation of the redeemed in every age of the world as much
        as mercy itself. God is shown not only to be merciful to forgive, but He
        is faithful and just to forgive the sinner his sins. Justice, instead of
        being reduced to the necessity of taking a part from the bankrupt, has
        received full payment, and guarantees his deliverance. Even the chief of
        sinners are shown, in the propitiatory sacrifice of their Surety, to be
        perfectly worthy of Divine love, because they are not only perfectly
        innocent, but have the righteousness of God He hath made Him to be sin
        for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
        in Him.
