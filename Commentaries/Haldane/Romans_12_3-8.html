      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
        is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
        think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man
        the measure of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        For appears to indicate the reason why those who were addressed should
        in all things ascertain the will of God. By introducing a particular
        instance of the importance of this duty, Paul enjoins the necessity of
        giving heed to his exhortation. It is the will of God that His people
        should make a just estimate of their own gifts, and not from ignorance
        overvalue themselves and despise others. I say, by the grace given unto
        me. — Although Paul sometimes addresses believers, as in the beginning
        of this chapter, in the humblest and most affectionate style, yet at
        other times, as in these words, he employs that tone of authority which
        was the prerogative of an Apostle. He calls on them to attend to his
        words, as remembering that he did not speak of himself; but, as he
        elsewhere expresses it, ‘as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in
        Christ.’ The grace given unto me. — This grace or favor bestowed upon
        Paul, is the of force of an Apostle. But it is not correct to say that
        grace in this place signifies apostleship. The apostleship was a grace
        or favor; but favor or grace is not apostleship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grace or favor includes, but by no means signifies, that office,
        although it is one of the innumerable gifts conferred by grace. To
        explain grace as signifying office, as is often done, is an instance of
        that unsound criticism that makes a word specifically designate whatever
        its general meaning includes, which, though in this instance it may be
        harmless is productive of much false interpretation. To every man that
        is among you. — The Epistle was addressed to all in the church at Rome,
        and consequently they were all included in the exhortation that follows.
        When, therefore, the Apostle addresses them here individually, it shows
        that the dissuasive refers to a thing to which all of them were
        naturally much inclined. With this, fact corresponds. All men are prone
        to overvalue themselves; and therefore to each of them Paul thus
        pointedly brings home the exhortation. Not to think of himself more
        highly than he ought to think. — In the two foregoing verses the Apostle
        had been enjoining the duty of entire devotedness to God, both in body
        and soul. Nothing could tend more powerfully to render his exhortation
        ineffectual, or stand more in the way of the performance of those duties
        on which, in the following part of the Epistle, he was about to
        expatiate, than high-mindedness in those whom he addressed. According,
        therefore, to the example of our Lord, both in His Sermon on the Mount,
        and when inviting sinners to come to Him, Paul begins here by
        inculcating humility. He warns each of them not to form a higher opinion
        of himself than his faith in God warranted. To this all are naturally
        prone; but there is an opposite error, assuming the semblance of
        obedience to this exhortation, which ought equally to be avoided. This
        is an affectation of humility by speaking of one’s self contemptuously.
        This species of hypocrisy ought to be avoided. When an author speaks of
        his poor abilities, and tells us he is the most unfit man for the work
        he has undertaken, he is generally insincere; but if not insincere, he
        must be unwise; for God never requires us to exercise a talent which He
        has not bestowed on us. Think soberly. — Christians are here directed to
        make a sound and moderate estimate of their own gifts, which will
        preserve them from both extremes, — on the one hand, from overrating,
        and, on the other, from unduly depreciating, their attainments or
        talents. According as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
        — God hath given us here, by the Apostle, a standard by which we may
        measure ourselves. Of the term ‘faith’ in this place, various
        explanations are given; but that it simply means faith in its usual
        acceptation throughout the Scriptures, as this is the most obvious, so
        it appears to be its true import.
      </p>
      <p>
        By faith we are united to the Savior, and by faith is received out of
        His fullness all that is imparted to us by God. The measure, then, of
        faith, with which each believer is blessed, whether strong faith or
        weak, great faith or little, indicates with certainty both his real
        character before God, and his relative standing among other believers.
        According, therefore, to his faith, as evidenced by his works, every
        Christian ought to estimate himself: The man who has the greatest faith
        is the highest in the school of Christ. We here also learn that not only
        faith, but every degree of it, is the gift of God; for men believe
        according as God hath dealt to each of them the measure of faith; and
        ‘unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the
        gift of Christ.’ By the consideration of the manner in which the Apostle
        thus enforces his admonition, the believer will both be moderated in his
        own esteem, and also in his desire for the esteem of others. He will
        consequently be much less exposed to encounter what may inflame his
        pride, or tend to his discouragement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
        not the same office; The Apostle here illustrates the union and
        connection of believers, by the figure of the wonderful structure of the
        human body. Every member has its proper place in the body, and its
        proper function to perform, and every member is valuable according as it
        is useful in the body. But no member is useless. For the smallest and
        least honorable is useful. But this does not imply, as Mr. Stuart
        understands it, that there is no superiority of value among the members.
        This is contrary to obvious fact, and contrary to the nature of the
        figure here employed. One member of the human body is more useful, and,
        as Paul says to the Corinthians, more honorable than another; but the
        least honorable is useful, and to be treated with respect. ‘To show,’
        says Mr. Stuart, ‘that no one has any reason to set up himself as
        superior to others, the Apostle now introduces the admirable comparison
        of the body of Christ, i.e., the Church, with the human body.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely it is not to teach us that all the members of the body of Christ
        are equally valuable, that the Apostle introduces the comparison. Such a
        comparison would be very ill chosen; for among the members of the body
        there is a great variety in their relative scale of importance. Who
        would not rather lose a joint of his finger than his eye? But while one
        member is more important than another in the human body, as well as in
        the body of Christ, every member is important; every member has its
        peculiar function, which contributes to the good of the whole, and which
        the most honorable members are not adapted to perform. The eye is a more
        important member than the foot, but the eye could not perform for the
        good of the body that function which the foot performs. The eye,
        therefore, as well as every other member of the body, ought to honor the
        foot, according to the value of the services it is adapted to perform.
        Office. — This does not mean office in a restricted sense, because every
        member of the body has such an office. It means office in its general
        sense of function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
        remembers one of another.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we, being many, are one body. — This is not to be restricted to one
        church, as to the church at Rome, to which it was written, but refers to
        the Church of Christ, which embraces His people of all ages, and of all
        countries. The feeblest disciple, even he who of the whole number is
        least instructed in his Master’s will, has still his place in the body,
        and his use in that place. Whatever church, then, refuses to receive any
        Christian for want of knowledge of any part of the will of Christ, acts
        against the spirit of this passage. It is wrong either to refuse
        admission to Christ’s known people, or to admit His known enemies. In
        Christ. — Not, as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight understands it, ‘under Christ.’ It is not by our being under
        Christ that our union is effected with one another, but by being in
        Christ. Members one of another. — By being united in Christ, believers
        become members of one another, that is, they are united to each other,
        as all the members of the body are united. The most remote members are
        united by their union with the body. The hands and the feet have
        fellowship through the intervening members. Hence Christians ought to
        love one another as parts of themselves. As the Apostle says, no man
        ever hated his own body; and he that loveth his wife loveth himself. For
        a like reason, a Christian, when loving his fellow-Christians, is loving
        himself. It is thus that Christians, in the Church of Christ, taken
        individually, are many, and are together one body in Christ, having the
        Spirit of Christ, and all of them are members one of another. This
        consideration ought to operate powerfully to unite them. There is a
        sectarian partiality, ‘distinct from this, too often found among the
        professors of Christianity. But as the union of Christians, here
        represented by that of the members of the human body, respects none but
        real Christians, and as it respects all such, whether they be eternally
        united in Christian fellowship with us or not, we ought to cultivate
        love to them as to the disciples of Christ, of whatever name, and
        cherish this love to them, on the ground of their union with Christ. We
        ought to unite with the Apostle in praying ‘Grace be with all them that
        love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
        given to us whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the
        proportion of faith; Having then gifts differing according to the grace
        that is given to us. — Upon this Dr. Macknight observes: — ’As the grace
        of apostleship signifies the office of an apostle graciously conferred,
        so the grace here said to be given to the Romans may mean the particular
        station and office in the Church assigned to individuals by Christ.’ But
        the word grace has neither the one signification nor the other. It is
        that favor by which Christ confers His gifts on the members of His body.
        Office in the Church belongs to few of them, but they all possess gifts
        or talents by which they may be useful to the body. Many of the gifts
        possessed when the Apostle wrote, were gifts miraculously bestowed; but
        even at that time they were not all such.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the word gifts includes those gifts that are given in providence, or
        conferred by constitution, talent, birth, education, and other
        circumstances, as well as the extraordinary gifts immediately conferred
        by the Holy Spirit. Riches and natural eloquence are gifts, as well as
        the miraculous ability to speak in languages not previously learned.
        Christians, then, should consider everything they possess as a gift
        bestowed by God, which they should cultivate and use to His glory, and
        for which they are accountable. If a Christian misspends his money, his
        time, his abilities, his influence, or any talent which God has
        conferred on him, he is not misspending his own, but, is misspending
        what is entrusted to him by God. He is unfaithful in his trust. Whether
        prophecy. — Prophecy strictly signifies the foretelling of future
        events. But it seems also to be extended to denote any message from God,
        whether relating to things present or to come, and, in the New
        Testament, to refer to the exposition of Scripture. Calvin, after
        remarking that ‘some mean by prophecy the power of prediction which
        flourished in the Church at its commencement,’ afterwards observes, ‘I
        prefer the opinion of those commentators who take the word in a more
        extended sense, and apply it to the peculiar gift of explaining
        revelation, according as any one executes with skill and dexterity the
        office of an interpreter in declaring the will of God. Prophecy,
        therefore, at this period, is nothing else in the Christian Church than
        the proper understanding of Scripture, and a peculiar faculty of
        explaining the same; since all the ancient prophecies, and all the
        oracles of God, were contained in Christ and His Gospel. For Paul
        understood it in this sense, 1 Corinthians 14:5, when he said, ‘I would
        that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that you prophesied’ ‘We know
        in part, and we prophesy in part,’ 1 Corinthians 13:9. For it does not
        appear that Paul was only desirous in this passage to recount those
        admirable graces by which Christ ennobled His Gospel at the beginning,
        but rather gives a statement of ordinary gifts, which certainly remain
        in the church. Proportion of faith. — They were to speak according to
        the extent of their information or measure of faith. This passage does
        not appear to relate to that principle of interpretation which is called
        the analogy of faith. This is a canon of Scripture interpretation which
        has no doubt been abused; but when rightly applied, as the word of God
        must be consistent with itself, it seems both reasonable and useful.
        Since the time of Dr. Campbell of Aberdeen, who keenly opposed this
        principle, it has been generally renounced by expositors of Scripture;
        yet, when viewed in a proper light, it is by no means liable to the
        exceptions made to it. The objections which Dr. Campbell brings against
        it are fully obviated in Dr. Carson’s late work, entitled, Examination
        of the Principles of Biblical Interpretation of Ernesti; Ammon, Stuart,
        and other Philologists, pp. 103-108. f58 Ver. 7. — Or ministry, let us
        wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or ministry . — The word in the original is that which appropriately
        designates the office of the deacon. If it refers to office, it must
        refer to this officer. For though ministry equally applies to Apostles,
        and all who serve in the Gospel, yet appropriately it refers to one
        office; and when it is applied to others, it is with circumstances that
        make the reference obvious. Indeed, what is here said applies to all
        offices as well as to that of the deacon; but this should not influence
        us so as to prevent our ascertaining its immediate reference. There is
        no necessity here to restrict the word to an official meaning, for it
        will apply to every one who devotes himself to the interests of the body
        of Christ. As Howard, the philanthropist, was to humanity, so may many
        Christians be to the Church of Christ, — at least, to that part of it
        with which they are more immediately connected. He that teacheth on
        teaching. — Fitness to teach is a gift of the Head of the Church, which
        all who teach ought to possess, and without which no appointment of any
        one can make Him a minister of Christ. They who possess the gift of
        teaching ought to employ it diligently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
        do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth
        mercy, with cheerfulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        He that exhorteth. — This means to excite to duty and dissuade from sin,
        and requires a peculiar talent. Mr. Stuart supposes that the teacher and
        exhorter were different officers; but it is quite obvious that the
        Apostle is not distinguishing offices, but gifts. Every gift does not
        require a different office. Many of the gifts required no office at all.
        No opinion can be more groundless, than that the gifts imply each a
        separate office in the Church. He that giveth. — This is usually
        supposed to refer to the deacon; but as the Apostle is not speaking of
        the distinction or number of offices, and as the word used is not so
        restricted, there is no just ground thus to limit the passage. It
        includes the deacon, but is not confined to him. Mr. Stuart, however, is
        not justified in saying that the word ‘properly means to impart among
        others what belongs to one’s self; to give to others.’ It is not
        essential to the word whether the gift proceeds from the giver as the
        owner, or merely as the steward. The gifts conferred by the Apostles
        were not their own; yet Paul applies the word ( Romans 1:11) to the
        communication of a spiritual gift through his hands to the Church. But
        to prove that the word here extends to those who gave of their own
        substance, it is not required that the word cannot apply to official or
        vicarious alms. It is enough that the word is one of a general meaning,
        and applies to the giving of one’s own. Why should it be confined to
        official giving, when there is nothing restrictive in the word or in the
        circumstances? Why should it be confined to the deacon, when the Apostle
        is not at all treating of office, but of gifts possessed by unofficial
        as well as official persons. With simplicity. — This means singleness of
        view It guards against ostentation or love of praise, on account of
        which the Pharisees gave their alms. The word is sometimes used to
        signify liberality, and is so understood here by Mr. Stuart. This
        meaning is not unsuitable, but still the other is more appropriate In
        all cases Christians need the caution to give with simplicity, but it
        would not be possible for some to give with what is generally understood
        by liberality. He that ruleth. — Mr. Stuart labors hard, but
        unsuccessfully, to make it appear that this word does not here apply to
        presiding or ruling in the Church, but to assisting the poor by
        hospitality, like Phebe. The word is usually applied to presiding in the
        church; and when it is used without a regimen, the most obvious meaning
        must be supplied to fill up the ellipsis.
      </p>
      <p>
        That this will confine it to ruling in the church admits of no question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presiding or ruling in the church is here considered, not with a view to
        its distinction from other offices, but with respect to the gift that
        fits for it. ‘Some are of opinion,’ says Dr. Macknight, ‘that the
        president was one appointed to superintend those who were employed in
        distributing the church’s alms.’ There can be no doubt that the word
        would apply to a president of any kind. But to believe that it signifies
        here such presidents, when it is appropriated to other presidents in the
        church, and when there is no evidence that there were any presidents of
        the kind supposed, is building without a foundation. With diligence. —
        The ruler is to attend to his office with earnestness and diligence It
        is the duty of all to spend and to be spent in the service of their
        Lord. Showeth mercy. — This signifies the giving of money, or anything,
        for the support of poor brethren; or applies to every instance in which
        mercy was to be shown to the afflicted, whether the affliction arose
        from poverty, sickness, or any other calamity. With cheerfulness. —
        Mercy must be shown, not only so as to indicate that it is voluntary,
        but also with cheerfulness, which shows that is a pleasure. This spares
        the feelings and soothes the sorrows of the afflicted.
