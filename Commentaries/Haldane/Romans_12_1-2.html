      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 12:1-21</p>
      <p>
        HERE we enter on the second division of this Epistle, where Paul,
        according to his accustomed method, enforces the duties of believers, by
        arguments dependent on his previous exhibition of the grand and
        influential doctrines of the Gospel. These doctrines, as well as all the
        commandments of God, may be summed up in one word, namely, in\parLOVE.
        By the view which they present of the goodness, the forbearance, and the
        long-suffering of God, believers are daily led to repentance, while the
        contemplation of the Divine compassion and philanthropy is calculated to
        beget reciprocal confidence and child-like affection. ‘We have known and
        believed,’ says the Apostle John, ‘the love that God hath to us.’ ‘We
        love Him because He first loved us.’ This love of God does not exclude
        reverential fear and filial devotion; of which, on the contrary, it is
        the principle and the foundation — while both together unite in the
        spirit of adoption to inspire the cry, ‘Abba, Father!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that
        ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
        which is your reasonable service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brethren. — The Apostle addresses the believers at Rome as his brethren,
        as standing on the same level with himself regarding acceptance with
        God. I beseech you. — We may here remark the difference between the
        endearing manner of address often used by inspired Apostles, and the
        haughty, overbearing tone of Popish antichristian tyranny. Those whose
        authority was avouched by mighty signs and wonders, whose very word was
        command, strive frequently to express commands as entreaties. Therefore.
        — This may have reference to what had been said in the foregoing chapter
        respecting the Gentiles and the Jewish nation in general, to whom, as
        being part of the elect remnants, some of those addressed belonged; or
        rather, as he now enters on the second division of the Epistle, Paul
        here refers to those grand doctrines of the Gospel which, in the
        preceding part of it, he had been unfolding, denominating the whole of
        them, as forming together the great plan of salvation, the mercies of
        God. By the mercies of God. — The word mercies or compassions is here
        used in the plural number, because it refers to the different instances
        before enumerated of Divine compassion. In the foregoing chapter, the
        Apostle had been declaring the mercies of God in the calling and
        restoration both of the Gentiles and the Jews, verse 31. But the whole
        of his preceding discourse contained a most striking and encouraging
        display of the mercies of God to all believers, in their election and
        predestination to eternal life, their calling, their deliverance from
        condemnation, their justification, their union with the Lord Jesus
        Christ, and communion with God, with the enjoyment of all the
        unspeakable blessings of the new covenant. Christians are here urged to
        devote themselves to the service of God by the consideration of these
        mercies because they present the strongest motives to obedience. How
        different is the mind of the Apostle from the mind of the world on this
        subject! The wisdom of this world rejects the grace of the Gospel,
        because it is thought to lead to licentiousness. The interests of
        morality are supposed to be better secured when salvation is suspended
        on men’s good works, than when it is represented as flowing from the
        Divine compassion. But Paul presents the mercies of God to the mind of
        believers, as the most powerful incitement to devote themselves to His
        service. In the remainder of the Epistle, we find him as strenuous in
        pressing the duty of holiness and personal obedience, as in the previous
        part of it, in insisting on those truths on which obedience is founded.
        This ought to convince of their error those who, misunderstanding the
        doctrine which the Apostle teaches, imagine that it is inconsistent with
        attention to the peculiar duties of Christianity. It will, however, be
        seen that the persons who seem to fear that his doctrine tends to
        licentiousness, are equally opposed to the strictness of his precepts,
        the observance of which they speak of as impracticable. That represent
        your bodies. — There is no necessity, with Mr. Stuart and the majority
        of commentators, to understand the term ‘bodies’ as denoting both soul
        and body. It is of the body that the Apostle here speaks, and it is not
        proper to extract out of his language more than it contains. The
        expression evidently makes a distinction between themselves and their
        bodies. Those addressed are entreated to present their bodies, and the
        body is here considered as the sacrifice. This, indeed, cannot be done
        without the soul, yet this is not the thing expressed. This shows the
        importance of serving God with the body as well as with the soul. Every
        member of the body is to be employed in the service of God. Many, when
        they use their members sinfully, attempt to excuse themselves, and found
        a plea for pardon, by alleging that they have a good heart. But we see
        from this passage that God requires the service of the body as well as
        that of the mind. Besides, an exclusive reference to the body comports
        better with the figure of offering a sacrifice. The apostle seems to
        summon attention peculiarly to our actions or outward deportment, which
        are of so great importance to the Christian life. But, in addition to
        this, if we extend the expression further, and include in it the whole
        man, we lose the beauty of the connection in the 2nd verse, which
        relates particularly, and likewise exclusively, to the state and frame
        of the mind. Sacrifice. — This term is used figuratively. It intimates
        that there are now no proper sacrifices. The sacrifice of Jesus on the
        cross has put an end to sacrifices. The sacrifice of the mass, then, is
        an invention of man, and an abomination to God. It is also observable
        that even figuratively it is not the Lord’s Supper, but the service of
        the body, that is here called a sacrifice. The phraseology that
        afterward prevailed, by which the table whereon the bread and wine were
        placed was called the altar, has no countenance in the word of God, even
        as a figure of speech. Living sacrifice. — This is called a living
        sacrifice, in distinction from the sacrifices of the law, in which the
        animal offered was put to death. The phraseology is quite similar to the
        phrases living bread and living way. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight, then, entirely errs when he explains the phrase as signifying
        ‘an excellent sacrifice,’ from the circumstance that animals were
        brought alive to the altar. Formerly those believers thus called on to
        offer their bodies a living sacrifice were dead in trespasses and sins,
        and had yielded their members as servants to iniquity; but now they were
        quickened, and risen with Christ, to walk in newness of life. And as the
        sacrifices were wholly devoted to God, so believers ought to be wholly
        consecrated to His service, preserving their bodies pure as temples of
        the Holy Ghost, and remembering that they themselves are living stones,
        built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
        sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Holy. — It was necessary
        that the sacrifices of the law should be holy, or free from everything
        that would render them ceremonially unclean. In like manner, the bodies
        of the saints must be holy as well as their souls. They must not be
        employed in the service of sin, else they cannot be fit to be presented
        to the Lord. Acceptable unto God. — The Jewish sacrifices, even if
        offered according to the law, now ceased to be acceptable to God, since
        they were abolished by the coming of their antitype, the lamb of God.
        But the preparation of the bodies of believers is a service that is
        always well pleasing to God. This and other such things as are obviously
        appointed are the only sacrifices acceptable to God. The sacrifice of
        the mass not being appointed by God, and actually subversive of the
        sacrifice of the cross, instead of being agreeable to God, must be
        odious in His sight. Your reasonable service. — This evidently refers to
        the distinction between the service of the Jews by sacrifices and
        ceremonial worship, and the service of Christians. Sacrificial worship,
        and, in general, the whole ceremonial ritual of the Jews, were not
        worship according to reason. It is, indeed, reasonable to worship God in
        whatever way He prescribes; but had not man fallen, he would not have
        been required to worship by such ceremonies as the Jewish law enjoined.
        Sacrificial worship is not in itself rational, and was appointed by God
        not for its own excellence, but from its adaptation to prefigure the
        good things to come. Many commentators appear to have mistaken the true
        meaning of this phrase, from an ill-grounded fear that it is
        disrespectful to the Divine appointments to suppose that they are not in
        themselves rational. This, however, is an important and obvious truth.
        Sacrificial service was appointed only as a shadow, and when abolished,
        is classed by the Apostle among ‘the weak and beggarly elements.’ But to
        worship God with our bodies is as rational as to worship Him with our
        souls. Such worship, then, is called reasonable worship or service, as
        distinguished from the Jewish ritual. Mr. Locke imagines that it is
        opposed to the irrational worship of the heathen. But to this the
        contrast is not exclusively confined; for it is evident that the
        sacrifices of the pagans were of the same kind as those of the Jews. If
        the nature of the one kind of sacrifices was irrational, so also must be
        the other. The difference between the heathen sacrifices and those of
        the Jews did not consist in the things offered, but in the object of the
        offerings. The one was appointed of God, and was accepted of God: the
        other was not only not appointed by God, but was an act of homage to
        devils. Agreeably to this view, it may be asserted with the utmost
        confidence, that sacrifices are of Divine appointment, and not an
        invention of men. They are not in themselves rational, and no abuse of
        reason would have led to such a practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by
        the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
        acceptable, and perfect will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And be not conformed to this world. — ’ World’ here denotes the people
        or inhabitants of the world. But there is no allusion, as Dr. Macknight
        supposes, to the heathen world. The same exhortation is as applicable to
        men in every age, even since so large a portion of the world has assumed
        the name of Christian, as it was to the pagan Roman empire. The wicked
        are called the world, not, as Dr. Macknight imagines, as the whole is
        put for a part, but on the principle that the righteous are
        comparatively so few. As the nation of Israel was so small in number as
        not to be counted among the nations, so are the people of God among the
        inhabitants of the earth. They are not counted in the world. ‘We know,’
        says the Apostle John, ‘that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
        wickedness.’ By conformity to the world is meant assimilation to the
        people of the world; or the sentiments, conduct, and customs by which
        they are distinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the character of those who are dead in trespasses and sins, that
        they walk ‘according to the course of this world,’ acting conformably to
        those maxims which regard only the present life; and they ‘who mind
        earthly things’ are described as the enemies of the cross of Christ; but
        the conversation of believers, as being pilgrims and strangers, is in
        heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        This prohibition, however, respects those things only that are sinful,
        and does not require singularity in the Christian in anything that is
        not contrary to the law of Christ. Pride may be indulged in the
        singularities of austerity, as well as in the imitation of fashionable
        folly. A sound Christian mind will have no difficulty in making the
        necessary discrimination on this subject. Transformed. — This word
        signifies the change of the appearance of one thing into that of
        another. It is used by the fabulous writers to signify the change or
        metempsychosis of animals into trees, or of men into the appearance of
        other animals. This term denotes the entire change that passes on a man
        when he becomes a Christian. He is as different from what he was before,
        as one species of animal is from another. Let not men be so far the
        dupes of self-deception as to reckon themselves Christians, while they
        are unchanged in heart and life. ‘If any man be in Christ, he is a new
        creature (or creation); old things are passed away, behold, all things
        are become new.’ If there be not a radical difference between their
        present state and that in which they were by nature, they have no title
        to the character of Christians. This shows that, in general, it is not
        difficult to discriminate Christians from the world. If the change be as
        great as the word of God here teaches, what difficulty can there be, in
        most cases, in judging of the character of those who profess
        Christianity? It is not the heart we are called to judge. If the person
        be metamorphosed, as the word originally implies, from a state of nature
        to a conformity with Christ, it will certainly appear, and the state of
        the heart will be evident from the life. As there are degrees in this
        transformation, although all Christians are transformed when they are
        born again, yet they ought to be urged, as here, to a further degree of
        this transformation. Renewing of your mind . — It is not the conduct
        merely, but the heart itself, of the Christian that is changed; and it
        is from the renewal of the mind that the conduct is also renewed. The
        transformation or change that passes on the man who becomes a believer
        of the Gospel, is not one produced by enthusiastically imaginations,
        monkish austerity, or a spirit of legalism, endeavoring to attain
        salvation by good works. It is produced by the renewing of the mind, and
        by that only. Many persons become for a time changed in conduct from
        various motives, who are not changed in heart by the Spirit of God, and
        the truth believed respecting the person and work of the Lord Jesus
        Christ. But such changes are generally temporary, and though they should
        continue for life, they are of no value in the sight of God. That change
        of life which the Lord will approve, is a change produced by the
        renovation of the mind, in the understanding, the affections, and the
        will. That ye may prove. The word in the original signifies both to
        prove and to approved, but we cannot so properly say approve what is the
        will of God. The passage seems to assert that to find out and
        discriminate the will of God with respect to those things that He
        requires and forbids, it is necessary to be renewed in the mind. Calvin
        well remarks, ‘If the renewal of our mind is necessary for the purpose
        of proving what the will of the Most High is, we may hence see how much
        this mind is opposed to God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, nothing can be more true than that these renewal of the mind is
        necessary for a successful inquiry into every part of the will of God.
        The natural man is in everything opposed to the mind of God. Good — The
        will of God is here distinguished as good; because, however much the
        mind may be opposed to it, and how much soever we may think that it
        curtails our pleasures, and mars our enjoyments, obedience to God
        conduces to our happiness. To follow His law is even in this world
        calculated to promote happiness. Acceptable. — That which the Lord
        enjoins is acceptable to Him, and surely this is the strongest motive to
        practice it. Nothing else is acceptable to Him, however specious it may
        appear to human wisdom. All injunctions that proceed merely from men in
        Divine things are unacceptable to God. He approves of nothing but
        obedience to His own commands. All the injunctions, then, that men
        submit to, in obedience to the mandates of the Church of Rome, are
        unacceptable to God. They are abomination in His sight. Perfect will of
        God. — The will of God as exhibited in His word is perfect. Nothing can
        be added to it, nothing can be taken from it; yet that monstrous system
        of Antichristianity which has so long, in the name of Christ, lorded it
        over the world, has added innumerable commands to those of Christ, and
        even taken away many of His laws.
