      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — I commend unto you Phebe our sister , which is a servant of
        the church which is at Cenchrea:
      </p>
      <p>
        I commend unto you Phebe. — Paul here introduces Phebe to the brethren
        at Rome. Letters of recommendation were unnecessary for those who
        derived their credentials specially from the Lord, and who were
        officially well known to the churches. Paul disclaims the necessity of
        such letters for himself to the church at Corinth, though at his first
        visit he needed the introduction of Barnabas to the brethren at
        Jerusalem. There might be doubts respecting Phebe at Rome, as there were
        doubts at Jerusalem with respect to Paul, and these could not be removed
        by mere profession, unsupported by sufficient evidence, whether of her
        faith, or of his apostleship. Phebe. — This was the name of the moon,
        one of the objects of the worship of the heathens. The moon was
        reverenced by females in honor of the goddess Diana. This person
        retaining that name shows that there is no necessity to renounce names
        that have been adopted under heathenish in honor of false gods. There is
        no necessity to give other names, as Christian names. Sister. — The
        terms brother and sister, taken from human relations, are given to
        express the new and spiritual relationship which subsists among
        believers, who by a new nature have become the sons of God and the
        brethren of Christ. This shows how nearly Christians are related, and
        how affectionately they ought to love one another. If Christians be all
        really brethren and sisters, nothing should disunite them in affection.
        Which is a servant, or deaconess. — As deacons were appointed to attend
        to the poor, so deaconesses were specially set apart in the churches in
        order to attend to the wants of their own sex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh Saints, and that
        ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath,
        been a succorer of many, and of myself also. That ye receive her. — The
        purpose of Paul’s recommendation was, that Phebe should be received by
        the church. In the Lord. — That is, that they would receive her as a
        member of the body of Christ. This shows that none ought to be received
        into communion by a church but those who are considered as being in the
        Lord. It shows also that all who are in the Lord ought to be received.
        The ground of Christian fellowship is union with Christ. As becometh
        saints. — Literally, worthily of the saints; that is, in a manner worthy
        of the saints. This is usually understood as respecting the receivers, —
        ’in a manner that becomes saints to receive such persons.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But it may respect the received, and signify, ‘in a manner worthy of
        those who are received, viz., the saints.’ The latter appears to be the
        meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word worthily applies best to this reference. The saints may be poor
        and despised, but they belong to the family in heaven; they are the
        brethren of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the sons of God. They are
        therefore worthy of honorable reception by their brethren. And that ye
        assist her. — The saints are not only to receive one another into
        fellowship and to hospitality, but also they are to pay attention to
        strangers thus received, assisting them in the business which may have
        brought them to their place of residence. For she hath been a succorer
        of many. — In addition to the general claim, the Apostle enhances the
        particular claims of Phebe by a reference to her own character. She was
        a most devoted person, and had exerted herself in assisting the brethren
        in distress. Myself also. — In what way Phebe had ministered to the
        assistance of the Apostle we are not informed. But she might have many
        opportunities of relieving him, either by contributing to his support or
        ministering personally to his comfort. Here we see that, while the
        Apostle often shows the obligation of the churches and individuals to
        himself, yet he acknowledges with gratitude the services of all who
        contributed to his relief.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 3. — Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>
        Greet Priscilla and Aquila. — The sending of salutations to particular
        persons or bodies was an indication of peculiar esteem and love. This
        shows us, in the first place, that in all things not sinful we may
        comply with the customs of mankind. There is no good, but much evil, in
        singularity with respect to anything, except such things as God has
        either forbidden or required. It is only when the authority of Jesus
        interposes that we are bound to depart from the world. There will be
        sufficient opportunities of doing this without creating them for
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singularity in dress or in phraseology has no countenance from the word
        of God. Christians are to show sobriety in their language and in their
        dress, but in neither are they to form a fashion of their own. In the
        second place, we may learn from these salutations that it is not
        contrary to the universal love which we ought to entertain for the whole
        household of God, to have a peculiar regard for individuals. Paul
        singles out individuals from the body in general as peculiar objects of
        his attentions and remembrance. My helpers. — Paul is not ashamed to
        mention those persons, one of whom was a woman, who is here first named,
        as his helpers in the Gospel He shows no jealousy about the invasion of
        his office in their labors to spread the Gospel. To fill any office in a
        church of Christ belongs only to those whom God has appointed to it; but
        to labor in the Gospel, either publicly or privately, is not peculiar to
        any office — not even to the office of an Apostle, but belongs to every
        Christian, according to the ability conferred on him by the Head of the
        Church. Christians are in general to blame for laboring so little in the
        Lord’s service, but they can never be charged with laboring too much.
        Priscilla and Aquila are styled by the Apostle fellow-laborers in Christ
        Jesus. And there is no doubt that Jesus will acknowledge all those
        persons as such, whether male or female, whether in office or out of
        office in his churches, they have labored to make sinners acquainted
        with the Gospel of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not
        only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who have for my life laid down their own necks. — We also speak of
        venturing the neck, or laying down the head; and both idioms are
        proverbial expressions, denoting to expose to death in whatever manner
        it may take place. This expression is proverbial, and is grounded on the
        manner of taking away the life of criminals on the block. Priscilla and
        Aquila are said to have laid down their necks, not because they had done
        so literally, but because they acted in such a manner as to expose their
        lives to jeopardy. A Christian is not required to substitute himself in
        the room of another Christian who is condemned to death. For this would
        be to go beyond the requirement of the law — it would be to love our
        neighbors better than ourselves. But there may be occasions when it is
        duty to act in such a manner for the benefit of the brethren, as to
        hazard life. This we are not to decline. This is what is meant by the
        Apostle John when he says that ‘we ought to lay down our lives for the
        brethren.’ Unto whom not only I give thanks. — The devoted conduct of
        this disciple and his wife was nothing but their duty; yet Paul returns
        them thanks before all the churches, and all the world. The speculations
        of some on this subject would banish gratitude as a Christian virtue. To
        do good to the brethren is duty in all Christians, but to be thankful
        for good done is equally duty. But also all the churches of the
        Gentiles. — Though the particular instance of exemplary benevolence
        shown by Priscilla and Aquila towards the Apostle is not recorded, yet
        no doubt it was well known at the time in all the churches; and the
        whole Gentile brethren considered themselves under obligations for the
        conduct of these two devoted Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
        well-beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Achaia unto Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise greet the church that is in their house. — Besides saluting
        Priscilla and Aquila, the Apostle sends his salutation to the church
        which assembled in their house. The same expression respecting the
        church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla occurs in 1 Corinthians
        16:19. On this passage Calvin remarks: ‘It is worthy of observation,
        that Paul could not confer a more distinguished honor and ornament on
        this family, than by making mention of the church in their house. I am
        not satisfied with Erasmus’ translation congregation; for Paul
        undoubtedly made an honorable mention of the church in this passage.’
        Salute my well-beloved (rather, my beloved) Epenetus. — Paul here calls
        Epenetus his beloved. He loved all Christians; but when he styles any of
        them his beloved, it imports that they were peculiarly objects of his
        affection. But to show this, there is no need, with our version, to
        translate the word well-beloved, because the English word beloved is as
        capable as the Greek of expressing such a meaning. This is a
        distinguished honor to Epenetus. If he was the beloved of Paul, he must
        have been eminent as a servant of Christ. First-fruits. — That is, the
        first converted in the place mentioned. Such persons are called the
        first-fruits of the place, in allusion to the first fruits under the
        law. The first-fruits were offered unto God before any of the harvest
        was used, which was a setting apart of the rest to the service of man,
        and a pledge of the harvest. It is here implied to be a peculiar honor
        to be the first to believe the Gospel in any country or district. This
        honor is conferred by God in a sovereign way. This shows that, though
        all believers are equally the purchase of Christ, and that they are all
        equally washed from sin in His blood, yet that they are not all
        partakers of equal honors. Here we see, also, that Paul, instead of
        refusing to give praise to the saints on account of any distinction,
        avails himself of every opportunity to bring into notice whatever may be
        creditable to those whom he mentions. Of Achaia. — Some, on the
        authority of certain manuscripts and versions, have substituted Asia for
        Achaia. The authority, however, does not seem sufficient. The objection,
        namely, that the household of Stephanas is elsewhere said to be the
        first-fruits of Achaia, is not applicable, for Epenetus may have been
        one of that household, and in that case the passages are quite
        consistent. Besides, the change to Asia may have been adopted in the
        manuscripts and versions in order to avoid a contradiction which was
        apprehended from the common reading. Unto Christ. — That is, Epenetus
        was the first-fruits offered or presented to Christ, as the first-fruits
        under the law were presented unto God. This is a proof of the deity of
        Christ. If believers are presented as an offering to Christ, He must be
        God.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 6. — Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us.</p>
      <p>
        That is, labored much in serving us, not, according to Dr. Macknight,
        who ‘labored with us,’ in the work of the Gospel. Many women labored in
        the Gospel with the Apostle, but that is no reason for forcing this
        phrase to refer to such. Works of kindness to the Apostle were worthy of
        approbation as well as the peculiar work of disseminating the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shows that every one has a talent, and ought to exercise it in the
        service of Christ. All are not missionaries or preachers of the Gospel,
        but all may in some way assist in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my
        fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the Apostles, who also were in
        Christ before me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is true, indeed, as Dr. Macknight observes, that the Apostle ( Romans
        9:3) calls all the Jews his kinsmen; but as he here distinguishes
        individuals by this character, it is necessary to understand him as
        speaking of kindred in a more limited sense. Though every Jew was, in a
        certain sense, related to Paul, and he calls the whole nation his
        kinsmen in the sense to which he there refers, yet there would be no
        propriety in singling out individuals of the nation as related to him
        who were not so actually. Here, then, we see how desirous the Apostle is
        to express his consideration of the brethren individually, so far as was
        in his power. This also recognizes the propriety of attachment to
        kindred. Though all Christians are brethren, yet this does not interfere
        with the attachment peculiar to the relations which God Himself has
        established among men. This is of great importance, as it sets aside the
        speculations of persons who would have us believe that all relations in
        life must be absorbed by the union of believers in Christ. My
        fellow-prisoners. — When, where, or by whom this imprisonment took
        place, we have no account; yet it is not the less certain. How absurd,
        then, is it to reason, as many do, as if research were necessary, in
        order to prove what the Scriptures allege in general terms. It is a
        distinguished honor to be imprisoned for the cause of Christ. As that
        which is highly esteemed among men is abomination with God, so this,
        which is disgraceful in the eyes of men, is the highest honor before
        God. Who are of note, or distinguished. — This is another proof that,
        though all Christians are equally pardoned and equally justified, God
        acts as a sovereign in this as in everything else. Among the apostles. —
        Those persons, from their active cooperation with the Apostles, were
        well known to them and distinguished among them. Were in Christ. — To be
        in Christ is to be a Christian, to be a member of the spiritual body of
        Christ. This takes place by faith, and in the first moment of believing
        in Him. Before me. — Here priority of conversion to God is reckoned an
        honor; and Paul, instead of claiming all honors to himself, is
        solicitous to exhibit what is honorable in every man’s situation, and to
        give the preference to others whenever that preference is due. The
        Fathers, as they are called, were pious men, but often lamentably
        deficient in judgment, and generally bad reasoners. From the fact that
        these persons, Andronicus and Junia, were Christians before Paul, and
        that they were distinguished among the Apostles, Origen infers that they
        were of the number of the seventy disciples. This is a conclusion
        without premises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such conjectural reasoning imposes on many, as it has the appearance of
        giving us additional information, and containing nothing contrary to the
        Scriptures. But it affords a most mischievous precedent for perverting
        the word of God, and in no instance can it be of any service.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 8. — Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.</p>
      <p>
        This person is another of those distinguished objects of the Apostle’s
        love. Paul loved all the brethren, but for some he had a peculiar
        affection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amplias was beloved of Paul in the Lord, as a Christian, or one who was
        a member of the spiritual body of Christ. Amplias, then, as he was one
        of the peculiar objects of Paul’s love in Christ, must have been
        distinguished for his devotedness to Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul, as we have before seen, felt no jealousy of others laboring in the
        Lord, but distinguishes all of them as peculiar objects of his regard.
        They who endeavor to check the efforts of any of the disciples of
        Christ, in aiming to save sinners by communicating to them the knowledge
        of the Gospel, have a spirit very opposite to that of Paul, and are
        counteracting what he commands. It is worthy of observation, also, that
        though Paul was an inspired teacher, yet he freely distinguishes the
        humblest of those who were in any manner engaged in the work of the
        Gospel as his fellow-laborers. Stachys is one of those whom Paul honors
        with an expression of peculiar love for Christ’s sake. How unlike is the
        spirit of this Apostle from that of men who, under mistaken notions,
        regard with coldness, dislike, or jealousy the labors of those who are
        not called to office in the Church of Christ!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
        Aristobulus’ household.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apelles is here distinguished as a tried disciple. It is mentioned to
        his honor that he was tried and approved in Christ. The Lord’s people
        have various and widely diversified characteristics as Christians. The
        Apostle selects that peculiar trait in the characters of those of whom
        he writes for which they are severally distinguished. Some of them are
        tried with peculiar afflictions, and their obedience to their Lord is
        put to the severest test. When they stand this fiery trial, it is the
        most distinguished honor, and their trials in the service of Christ
        ought to be held up to notice. This is due to them from their brethren,
        and it is a great encouragement to others who are similarly tried. All
        the Lord’s people are not exposed to trials equally severe; and when the
        Lord calls any of them to glorify His name by suffering peculiarly for
        His sake, we are here taught to treat them with peculiar honor. How very
        unfounded, then, and unscriptural, are the views of those who would fear
        the encouragement of a proud legal spirit, were they to utter a word of
        praise with respect to the characters of any of the Lord’s servants.
        From perceiving an extreme on one hand, they plunge into the opposite.
        But they confound things entirely distinct. That praise which a worldly
        spirit is accustomed to seek or to give, is quite different from that
        which the Apostle confers. The latter excites to greater devotedness;
        but the former puffs up, and is quite opposed to the spirit of the
        Gospel ‘How can ye believe,’ says Christ, ‘who receive honor one of
        another?’ Such persons love the praise of men more than the praise of
        God. But the honor which is given by the Lord’s servants, after the
        example of Paul, is to the honor of the Lord, and for the interest of
        His cause. Aristobulus’ household. — Aristobulus was evidently a
        personage of great distinction, who had many domestics, of whom there
        were some who had believed the Gospel. When the head of the family
        believed, he vas usually saluted, and his household with him. When,
        therefore, salutations are sent to some of his family or slaves, and not
        to himself, there is no reason to conclude that Aristobulus was a
        believer. It is true, as Dr. Macknight suggests, he might have been
        abroad or dead, but there is no need of such suppositions where no part
        of the statement implies that he was a believer.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we see the sovereignty of God, in calling some of a family and
        leaving others in unbelief. And we may see the peculiarity of this
        sovereignty, in calling the slaves and overlooking the master. God does
        not judge as man judges. It would have been as easy for the Lord Jesus
        to have called Aristobulus as the meanest of his domestics; and human
        wisdom would have given the preference to the master. We see this
        exemplified in a thousand instances in our own day. Religious parties,
        in order to advance their interests, often select as their chief patrons
        and officers the greatest personages who will consent to give them their
        names, and even though they should be manifest enemies to the Gospel by
        wicked works. When the Lord has need of the talents of the great, the
        rich, or the learned He can convert them, and when He does convert them,
        they are a blessing for which God ought to be praised; but some persons
        choose those whom Christ has not chosen, even the enemies of Christ, for
        which they will have no praise from their Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the
        household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salute Herodion my kinsman. — This is another person that Paul
        acknowledges as a relation, thereby recognizing the affection becoming
        the natural ties of kindred. The household of Narcissus is saluted like
        that of Aristobulus. Whether this Narcissus was the distinguished
        favorite of the Emperor Claudius, the Scriptures do not determine, and
        it, therefore, can be of no importance to be ascertained. It might
        minister a question to curiosity, and thereby lead away from profitably
        considering what the Scriptures contain, in order to discover what they
        do not contain. This is a vain as well as an unprofitable way of
        spending time. Persons who indulge in it may fancy that they are
        studying and throwing light upon Scripture, but they are only covering
        God’s word with a heap of rubbish, gratifying an idle curiosity, and
        tending to draw away attention from the truths of eternal importance
        which the Scriptures reveal. Which are in the Lord. — This shows us what
        sort of persons were recognized in the first churches. They were such
        only as were believed to be in the Lord, that is, members of the
        spiritual body of Christ. It shows, also, that persons who at the time
        appeared to be Christians were considered as such without any distrust
        with respect to the reality of their faith, though with respect to some
        the fact might afterwards manifest the contrary. Man judges by evidence,
        and is warranted to proceed with confidence upon that evidence, though
        the Searcher of hearts may see the profession to be without the true
        knowledge of God, or change of heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        This explains the passage in Ezekiel with respect to the righteous
        turning away from his righteousness; and the passage in Hebrews, ‘If any
        man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute
        the beloved Persis, which labored much in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa who labor in the Lord. — These were women
        who labored in the Gospel This shows that, while women are excluded from
        speaking in the church, they are not excluded from laboring in the
        Gospel. The Lord has not only permitted women to labor in the Gospel,
        but He has, both in the apostolic and in the present time, singularly
        blessed their labors. Beloved Persis. — She was another woman who
        employed herself in the service of the Gospel, and is peculiarly
        distinguished as laboring much in the Lord. Even among the faithful
        servants of the Lord there is a difference of activity in His service,
        and the servant who labors much is peculiarly noticed by Paul. As,
        however, all the good deeds of the Lord’s people are done only by the
        influence of His spirit, none have in themselves ground of boasting.

        Ver. 13. — Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        All believers are chosen of God. When Rufus is distinguished as the
        chosen, he must have furnished distinguished evidence of his election.
        He was chosen in the Lord, for none are elected but in Christ. Their
        election is without regard to merit in themselves: they are chosen in
        Christ. His mother and mine. — The word mother seems to be used in its
        proper signification in respect to Rufus, and figuratively in its
        application to Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a high honor to be so distinguished by the Apostle. This person,
        it appears, had behaved to the Apostle with the kindness, affection, and
        tenderness of a mother. This inculcates kindness and attention on the
        part of Christians towards those who are devotedly laboring in the
        service of Christ. It may, indeed, be a matter of lamentation that there
        are few like this woman; but it is equally a matter of lamentation that
        there are so few believers who manifest that devotedness which was
        constantly exhibited by Paul When the laborers in Christ’s vineyard make
        no sacrifice, they should not expect what is due only to signal
        devotedness and disinterestedness.

        Ver. 14. — Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Pacrobas, Hermes, and the
        brethren which are with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
        Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here a number of brethren are selected without distinction. This mark of
        brotherly attention would gratify those whom the Apostle here names,
        besides the brethren who were with them. The lord’s people are not
        equally distinguished, but they are all brethren equally related to Him
        who is the Elder Brother of His people. Some of them are eminent, and
        others are without peculiar distinction. They are all, however, worthy
        of love. A church is not to consist of the most eminent believers, but
        of believers, though some be of the lowest attainments. A church of
        Christ is a school in which their education is to be perfected. And all
        the saints which are with them. — That is, the believers in their
        families and neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        These might not be personally known to the Apostle, but as believers
        they were worthy of his notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might at first sight appear strange that in an inspired letter, which
        was to be preserved to the end of the world for the edification and
        instruction of the churches, there should be so much of it taken up with
        what many might consider as useless ceremony. But as the Apostle was
        inspired by the Spirit of God in this, no well as in the highest
        matters, it is evident that we ought to look for instruction from this
        peculiarity of his writings. This shows the value of inspiration; for
        were these writings merely human, we should not look for instruction
        from such things. It shows us that every attention that expresses and
        promotes love ought to be exhibited among Christians, who should employ
        the forms and courtesies of social life that manifest respect in order
        to show their esteem and affection for one another.

        Ver. 16. — Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
        salute you.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the salutations sent to the brethren, Paul passes to the injunction
        of a form of salutation to the used among those to whom he wrote. He
        enjoins them to salute one another with a holy kiss. He calls it a holy
        kiss as distinguished not only from that which is sinful, but also from
        the kiss that merely expresses common affection. The latter was proper
        in itself as an expression of kindness among relations or friends; but
        this is grounded on the love that Christians should have for one
        another, and is a holy kiss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much ridicule has been cast on this practice. But it was enjoined on the
        churches by the Apostles. It is again and again repeated, and was
        practiced by all the primitive churches. Peter calls it a kiss of love.
        Justin Martyr, in giving an account of the weekly assemblies of the
        Christians of the second century, says, ‘We mutually salute one another
        by a kiss, and then we bring forward the bread and the cup.’ And the
        form is still maintained by the Church of Rome in what they call the
        osculum pacis. The churches of Christ salute you. — Not only did
        individuals send salutations to churches or individuals with whom they
        had a personal acquaintance, but whole churches sent salutations to one
        another in consideration of their common union in the Lord.
