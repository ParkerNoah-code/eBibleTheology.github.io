      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 15. — What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but
        under grace? God forbid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had been proving that his doctrine of a free justification
        by faith without works furnishes no license to believers to continue in
        sin, but, on the contrary, that the death of Jesus Christ for the sins
        of His people, and His resurrection for their justification, secures
        their walking in holiness of life. On this ground, in verses 12 and 13,
        he had urged on them the duty of obedience to God; and having finally
        declared, in the 14th verse, that, by the blessing of God, they should
        be enabled to perform it, he now proceeds to caution them against the
        abuse of this gracious declaration. If a man voluntarily sins, on the
        pretext that he is not under the law, but under grace, it is a proof
        that the grace of God is not in him. ‘Whosoever is born of God doth not
        commit sin, for his seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he
        is born of God.’ What then — What is the inference which should be
        deduced from the preceding declaration? shall we sin, because we are not
        under law, but under grace? — This question, proposed by the Apostle as
        an objection likely to be urged against his doctrine, plainly shows in
        what sense we are to understand the term law in the 14th verse. Were it
        not under stood of the moral law, it would not be liable to the supposed
        objection. The fact of not being under the ceremonial law, or of a
        change of dispensation from that of Moses to that of Christ, would never
        lead to such an objection. No one could suppose that the abolition of
        certain external rites would authorize men to break moral precepts. No
        view of the law could give occasion to the objection but that which
        includes freedom from the moral law. This would at once appear to
        furnish a license to sin with impunity; and it would be justly liable to
        this objection if freedom from the moral law meant, as some have argued,
        a freedom from it in every point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        The freedom from the moral law which the believer enjoys, is a freedom
        from an obligation to fulfill it in his own person for his justification
        — a freedom from its condemnation on account of imperfection of
        obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is quite consistent with the eternal obligation of the moral
        law as a rule of life to the Christian. Nothing can be more
        self-evidently certain than that, if the moral law is not a rule of life
        to believers, they are at liberty to disregard its precepts. But the
        very thought of this is abominable. The Apostle therefore rejects it in
        the strongest terms, in the way in which he usually expresses his
        disapprobation of what is most egregiously wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
        obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or
        of obedience unto righteousness?
      </p>
      <p>
        Know ye not? — That is, the thing by which I am now going to illustrate
        the subject, is a fact of which you cannot be ignorant. All of them well
        knew the truth of what Paul was about to say, and by this similitude
        they would be able to comprehend the doctrine he was teaching. The
        ground, however, of the use of this phraseology has no resemblance, as
        Mr. Stuart supposes, to that used in verses 6 and 9. Here the Apostle
        speaks of a thing which all men know, and which belongs to the common
        relations of society. There he speaks of what they know only as
        Christians by revelation. Yield yourselves or, present yourselves. —
        Not, as Mr. Stuart translates it, ‘proffer yourselves.’ It is possible
        among men that proffered service may be rejected, or that, at least,
        something may occur to prevent performance of the actual service; and it
        is of transactions among men that the Apostle is speaking; but, in the
        Apostle’s view, the presented service is accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart’s translation in his Commentary is better. ‘Where you have
        once given up yourselves to any one as servants.’ This, however, is
        quite a different idea from what he expresses in the text. Servants to
        obey, literally, unto obedience. — Mr. Stuart’s translation is not to be
        approved of here, ‘ready to obey,’ or ‘bound to obey.’ The idea is not
        that they were bound by this presentation of themselves to continue in
        obedience to the master. The servants unto obedience are not servants
        who are bound to obey, but servants who actually obey — whose servitude
        is proved and perfected in their works. Mr. Stuart entirely mistakes the
        sentiment expressed by the Apostle when he paraphrases thus: — ’When you
        have once given up yourselves to any one as dou>louv eijv uJpakoh>n ,
        you are no longer your own masters, or at your own disposal; you have
        put yourselves within the power and at the disposal of another master.’
        The language of the Apostle is not designed to prove that, by presenting
        themselves to a master, they are bound to his service, but to state the
        obvious fact that they are the servants of him whose work they do. If we
        see a number of laborers in a field, we know they are the servants of
        the proprietor of the field — of the person in whose work they are
        employed. The application of this fact to the Apostle’s purpose is
        obvious and important. If men are doing the work of Satan, must they not
        be Satan’s servants? If they are doing God’s work, must they not be the
        servants of God? Mr. Stuart’s exposition leads entirely away from the
        Apostle’s meaning. Of sin. — Sin is here personified, and sinners are
        its servants. Unto death. — That is, which ends in death. This is the
        wages with which sin rewards its servants. Obedience unto righteousness.
        — Obedience is also personified, and the work performed to obedience is
        righteousness; that is, the works of the believer are righteous works.
        Nothing can be more false as a translation, or more erroneous in
        sentiment, than the version of Mr. Stuart. ‘Obedience unto
        justification.’ In his paraphrase he says, ‘But if you are the servants
        of that obedience which is unto justification — i.e. which is connected
        with justification, which ends in it — then you may expect eternal
        life.’ Dikaiosu>nh , which he here translates justification, is
        righteousness, and never justification. In verses 18, 19, and 20, that
        follow, he himself translates it righteousness. And what can be more
        completely subversive of the doctrine of justification, and of the
        Gospel itself, than the assertion that obedience ‘ends in,’ or, as he
        says afterwards, will lead to justification? This is the translation of
        the English Socinian version, and of that adopted in their different
        editions of the New Testament by the Socinian pastors of the church of
        Geneva. ‘De l’obeissance qui conduit à la justification.’ Of obedience
        which leads to justification. They have, however, printed the word
        ‘conduit’ (leads to) in italics, to show that it is a supplement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart says that his view seems to him quite clear, from
        justification being the antithesis unto death. But justification is not
        an exact antithesis to death. It is life that is the antithesis to
        death. There is no need, however, that there should be such an exact
        correspondence in the parts of the antithesis as is supposed. And there
        is a most obvious reason why it could not be so. Death is the wages of
        sin but life is not the wages of obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart asks, ‘How can dikaiosu>nhn here mean holiness uprightness
        when uJpakoh> itself necessarily designates this very idea? What is an
        obedience which leads to righteousness? Or how does it differ from
        righteousness itself, inasmuch as it is the very act of obedience which
        constitutes righteousness in the sense now contemplated? ‘It is replied
        that obedience is here personified, and therefore righteous actions are
        properly represented as performed to it. Mr. Stuart might as well ask
        why are obedience to sin, and the lusts of sin, supposed to be different
        things in verse 12. In like manner we have righteousness and holiness in
        verse 19, and fruit and holiness in verse 22. Besides, obedience and
        righteousness are not ideas perfectly coincident. Righteousness refers
        to works as to their nature; obedience refers to the same works as to
        their principle. Mr. Stuart’s remark is both false in criticism, and
        heretical in doctrine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye
        have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here expresses his thankfulness to God that they who had
        formerly been the servants of sin were now the servants of
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        To suppose, as some do, that sin itself could be a matter of
        thankfulness, is a most palpable error, than which nothing can be more
        remote from the meaning of this passage. Obeyed from the heart. —
        Christian obedience is obedience from the heart, in opposition to an
        obedience which is by constraint. Any attempt at obedience by an
        unconverted man, is an obedience produced by some motive of fear,
        self-interest, or constraint, and not from the heart. Nothing can be
        more convincing evidence of the truth of the Gospel than the change
        which, in this respect, it produces on the mind of the believer. Nothing
        but almighty power could at once transform a man from the love of sin to
        the love of holiness. That form of doctrine which was delivered you. —
        There are various solutions of this expression, all substantially
        agreeing in meaning, but differing in the manner of bringing out that
        meaning. The most usual way is to suppose that there is a reference to
        melted metals transferred to a mold, which obey or exactly conform to
        the mold. It is perhaps as probable that the reference is to wax or clay
        or any soft matter that takes the form of the stamp or seal. There is
        another method of explaining the phraseology not unworthy of
        consideration — Ye have obeyed from the heart that form or model of
        doctrine unto which you have been committed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way the form of doctrine or the Gospel is considered as a
        teacher, and believers are committed to its instructions. The word
        translated delivered, will admit of this interpretation, and it is
        sufficiently agreeable to the general meaning of the expression. The
        substance of the phrase, however, is obvious, and let it be translated
        as it may, there is no essential difference in the meaning. It proves
        the holy tendency of the doctrine of grace which believers have
        retrieved, the blessed effects of which they have felt, and manifested
        in its fruits, Titus 2:11,12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
        righteousness . Being then made free from sin . — The original word here
        rendered free, as also in verses 20 and 22, is different, as has been
        observed, from that improperly rendered freed in verse 7, and has no
        respect to the justified state of the believer, as is clear from the
        context, but relates to his freedom from the dominion of sin assured to
        him in the 14th verse. There is here a reference to the emancipation of
        slaves from their masters. For merely they were slaves to sin; now they
        have been emancipated by the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This deliverance is called their freedom. It does not, however, by any
        means import what has been called sinless perfection, or an entire
        freedom from the influence of sin. Ye became servants of righteousness.
        — Here we see the proper meaning of the word dikaiosu>nh. The servants
        of righteousness are men obedient to righteousness, being devoted to the
        practice of such works as are righteous, or, as is said in other words,
        in verse 22, ‘servants of God.’ What meaning could we attach to servants
        of justification? The idea is, that the believer ought to be as entirely
        devoted to God as a servant or slave is to his master. Mr. Stuart is
        here of necessity compelled to allow the true meaning of the same word,
        which, in the 16th verse, in consistency with his unscriptural system,
        he had mistranslated, by rendering it justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of
        your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness,
        and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants
        to righteousness unto holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I speak after the manner of men. — This refers to the illustration of
        the subject by the customs of men as to slavery. Mr. Stuart has either
        missed the idea here, or expressed it too generally. He translates, ‘in
        language usual to men,’ and expounds, ‘I speak as men are accustomed to
        speak, viz., I use such language as they usually employ in regard to the
        affairs of common life’ This makes the reference merely to the words
        used; whereas the reference is to the illustration drawn from human
        customs. In what way could the Apostle speak but as men are accustomed
        to speak? Could he speak in any other language than that which was usual
        to men? This is a thing in which there is no choice. If he speaks at
        all, he must use human language. But to illustrate spiritual subjects by
        the customs of men is a matter of choice, because it might have been
        avoided This establishes the propriety of teaching Divine truth through
        illustrations taken from all subjects with which those addressed are
        acquainted. This method not only facilitates the right perception or
        apprehension of the subject, but also assists the memory in retaining
        the information received. Accordingly, it was much used by our Lord and
        His Apostles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calvin has not caught the spirit of this passage: ‘Paul,’ he says,
        ‘means that he speaks after the manner of men with respect to forms, not
        the subject-matter, as Christ ( John 3:12) says, “If I have told you
        earthly things,” when He is, however, discoursing on heavenly mysteries,
        but not with so much majesty as the dignity of the subject demanded,
        because He accommodated Himself to the capacity of a rude, dull, and
        slow people.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Here Calvin also makes the reference apply not to human customs, but to
        human language and style. It may also be asked, why the Lord did not
        express Himself with so much majesty as the dignity of the subject
        demanded? It cannot be admitted that His language, or the language of
        inspiration, ever falls short of the dignity demanded by the subject.
        Because of the infirmity of your flesh. — That is, the weakness of their
        spiritual discernment through the corruption of human nature. This does
        not refer, as Mr. Stuart supposes, to ‘the feeble or infantile state of
        spiritual knowledge among the Romans,’ but is applicable to mankind in
        general. Men in all places, and in all ages, and in every period of
        their lives, are weak through the flesh, both in spiritual discernment,
        and in the practice of holiness. Men of the most powerful mental
        capacity are naturally dull in apprehending the things of the Spirit.
        Accordingly errors abound with them as much as with the most illiterate,
        and often in a far greater degree. Besides, such a peculiar application
        to those in the church at Rome is inconsistent with chapter 15:14, where
        the Apostle says that they were ‘filled with all knowledge, able also to
        admonish one another.’ For as ye have yielded your members servants to
        uncleanness. — This shows the state of men by nature, and especially the
        state of the heathen world at the period of the highest refinement.
        Uncleanness means all impurity, but especially the vice opposed to
        chastity. Iniquity, as distinguished from this, refers to conduct
        opposed to laws human and Divine. The one refers principally to the
        pollution, the other to the guilt of sin. Unto iniquity. — Some
        understand this as signifying from one iniquity to another, or from one
        degree of iniquity to another, which is not its meaning. Neither can it
        signify, as it is sometimes understood, for the purpose of iniquity, for
        men often sin when it cannot be justly said that they do so for the
        purpose of sinning. They often sin from the love of the sin, when they
        wish it was not a sin. Their object is selfish gratification. It is
        evident that the phrase is to be understood on a principle already
        mentioned, namely, that iniquity is in the first occurrence personified,
        and in the second, it is the conduct produced by obedience to this
        sovereign.
      </p>
      <p>
        They surrender their members unto the slavery of iniquity as a king, and
        the result is, that iniquity is practiced. This corresponds with the
        sense, and suits the antithesis. Righteousness unto holiness. —
        Righteousness is here personified as iniquity was before, and obedience
        to this sovereign produces holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Tholuck misunderstands this verse, which, in connection with the
        21st, he paraphrases thus: ‘While engaged in the service of sin, you
        possessed, it is true, the advantage of standing entirely out of all
        subjection to righteousness; but let us look to what is to be the final
        result.’ The Apostle is not speaking of freedom from righteousness as an
        advantage either real or supposed, nor could he thus speak of it. He is
        speaking of it as a fact; and from that fact he argues that, as when
        they were the servants of sin they were free from righteousness —
        yielding no obedience to it, and acting as if they had nothing to do
        with, and had no relation to it — so now, as they are the servants of
        righteousness, they ought to hold themselves free from the slavery of
        sin. The consequence, indeed, is not drawn, but is so plain that it is
        left to the reader. The sentiment is just and obvious. When they were
        the subjects of their former sovereign, they were free from the service
        of their present sovereign. So now, as they are subjects to
        righteousness, they ought to be free from sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart also misunderstands this verse. He explains it thus: ‘When
        you served sin, you deemed yourselves free from all obligation to
        righteousness.’ This the Apostle neither says, nor could say. For it is
        not true that natural men, whether Pagans or under a profession of
        Christianity, regard themselves as bound by no obligations to
        righteousness. The law of nature teaches the contrary. But whatever is
        their light on this subject, it is a fact that they are free from
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>This, we learn, is the state of all natural men.</p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
        ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
      </p>
      <p>
        What fruit had ye then in those things? — Besides the exhortations to
        holiness which he had already employed, the Apostle here sets before
        believers the nature and consequences of sin. Unprofitable and shameful
        in it character, its end is death. He asks what advantage had they
        derived from their former conduct. Fruit here signifies advantage, and
        not pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many interpret this verse as if the Apostle denied that they had any
        pleasure in their sins at the time of committing them. This the Apostle
        could not do; for it is a fact that men have pleasure in sin. To say
        that sinful pleasure is no pleasure, but is imaginary, is to abuse
        terms. All pleasure is a matter of feeling, and a man is no less happy
        than he feels himself to be; if he imagines that he enjoys pleasure, he
        actually enjoys pleasure. But what advantage is there in such pleasure?
        This is the question which the Apostle asks. Whereof ye are now ashamed.
        — It is a remarkable fact that men in a state of alienation from God
        will commit sin not only without shame, but will glory in many things of
        which they are ashamed the moment they are changed by the Gospel. They
        now see their conduct in another light. They see that it was not only
        sinful but shameful. For the end of those things is death. — Here is the
        answer to the question with respect to the fruit of unrighteous conduct.
        Whatever pleasure they might have found in it, the end of it is ruin.
        Death. — This cannot be confined to natural death, for that is equally
        the end with respect to the righteous as well as the wicked.
      </p>
      <p>It includes the whole penalty of sin — eternal punishment.</p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — But note, being made free from sin, and become servants to
        God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having concluded his triumphant reply to the objection, that his
        doctrine concerning justification leads to indulgence in sin, the
        Apostle here assures those to whom he wrote of the blessed effects of
        becoming servants to God. In the eighth chapter these are fully
        developed. But now, being made free from sin, — that is, emancipated
        from a state of slavery to sin. Fruit unto holiness. — Fruit, in this
        verse, denotes conduct, and holiness its specific character or quality.
        When conduct or works are called fruit, their nature is not expressed;
        they are merely considered as the production of the man. Fruit unto
        holiness is conduct that is holy. And the end everlasting life. — Fruit
        unto holiness, or holy conduct, is the present result of freedom from
        sin, and of becoming servants to God; eternal life is the final result.
        Eternal life is the issue of the service of God, but it is not the
        reward of its merit. Hence the Apostle here uses the phrase eternal life
        when he is speaking of the issue of the service of God. But in verse 16
        he says, ‘obedience unto righteousness,’ and not ‘obedience unto eternal
        life,’ because he had, in the preceding member of the sentence, spoken
        of death as the punishment of sin. Had he used the word eternal life in
        connection with obedience in this antithesis, it would have too much
        resembled an assertion that eternal life is the reward of our obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
        life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wages of sin is death. — Here, as in the conclusion of the preceding
        chapter, death is contrasted with eternal life. Sin is a service or
        slavery, and its reward is death, or eternal misery. As death is the
        greatest evil in this world, so the future punishment of the wicked is
        called death figuratively, or the second death. In this sense death is
        frequently spoken of in Scripture; as when our Lord says, ‘Whosoever
        believeth on Me shall never die.’ Death is the just recompense of sin.
        The Apostle does not add, But the wages of obedience is eternal life.
        This is not the doctrine of Scripture. He adds, But the gift of God is
        eternal life. The gift that God bestows is eternal life. He bestows no
        less upon any of His people; and it is the greatest gift that can be
        bestowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Gill on this passage remarks, ‘These words, at first sight, look as
        if the sense of them was, that eternal life is the gift of God through
        Christ, which is a great and glorious truth of the Gospel; but their
        standing in opposition to the preceding words require another sense,
        namely, that God’s gift of grace issues in eternal life, through Christ:
        Wherefore, by the gift of God is not meant eternal life, but either the
        gift of a justifying righteousness or the grace of God in regeneration
        and sanctification, or both, which issue in eternal life.’ This remark
        does not appear to be well founded. The wages of sin do not issue in
        death, or lead to it, but the wages of sin is death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Death is asserted to be the wages of sin, and not to be another issue to
        which the wages of sin lead; and the gift of God is not said to issue in
        eternal life, but to be eternal life. Eternal life is the gift here
        spoken of. It is not, as Dr. Gill represents, ‘eternal life is the gift
        of God,’ but ‘the gift of God is eternal life.’ The meaning of these two
        propositions, though nearly alike, are not entirely coincident. The
        common version is perfectly correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of the propositions might with truth be rendered convertible, but
        as they are expressed by the Apostle they are not convertible; and we
        should receive the expression as it stands. No doubt the gift of
        righteousness issues in eternal life; but it is of the gift of eternal
        life itself, and not of the gift of righteousness, that the Apostle is
        here speaking; and the Apostle’s language should not be pressed into a
        meaning which is foreign to his design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life after death are set before us in the Scriptures. On the one hand,
        indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish; on the other, glory, and
        honor, and peace. To one or other of these states every child of Adam
        will finally be consigned. To both of them, in the concluding verse of
        this chapter, our attention is directed; and the grounds on which
        never-ending misery or everlasting blessedness will be awarded, are
        expressly declared. ‘The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
        eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. ’ The punishment of that
        death which was the threatened penalty of the first transgression, will,
        according to Scripture, consist in the pains both of privation and
        suffering. Its subjects will not only be bereaved of all that is good,
        they will also be overwhelmed with all that is terrible. As the chief
        good of the creature is the enjoyment of the love of God, how great must
        be the punishment of being deprived of the sense of His love, and
        oppressed with the consciousness of His hatred! The condemned will be
        entirely divested of every token of the protection and blessing of God,
        and visited with every proof of His wrath and indignation. According to
        the awful declaration of the Apostle, they shall be punished with
        everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
        glory of His power, in that day ‘when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
        from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on
        them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
        Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This punishment will be adapted to both the component parts of man’s
        nature — to the soul as well as to the body. It will connect all the
        ideas of the past, the present, and the future. As to the past, it will
        bring to the recollection of the wicked the sins they committed, the
        good they abused, and the false pleasures by which they were deluded. As
        to the present, their misery will be aggravated by their knowledge of
        the glory of the righteous, from which they themselves are for ever
        separated, and by the direful company of the devil and his angels, to
        the endurance of whose cruel slavery they are for ever doomed. As to the
        future, the horrors of their irreversible condition will be rendered
        more insupportable by the overwhelming conviction of its eternity. To
        the whole must be added that rage against God, whom they will hate as
        their enemy, without any abatement or diminution.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not to be questioned that there will be degrees in the punishment
        of the wicked. This is established by our Lord Himself, when He declares
        that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of
        judgment than for the Jews. This punishment being the effect of Divine
        justice, the necessary proportion between crime and suffering will be
        observed; and as some crimes are greater and more aggravated than
        others, there will be a difference in the punishment inflicted. In one
        view, indeed, all sins are equal, because equally offenses against God,
        and transgressions of His law; but, in another view, they differ from
        each other. Sin is in degree proportioned not only to the want of love
        to God and man which it displays, but likewise to the manner in which it
        is perpetrated. Murder is more aggravated than theft, and the sins
        against the second table of the law are less heinous than those
        committed against the first. Sins likewise vary in degree, according to
        the knowledge of him who commits them, and inasmuch as one is carried
        into full execution, and another remains but in thought or purpose. The
        difference in the degree of punishment will not consist, however, in
        what belongs to privation — for in this it must be equal to all — but in
        those sufferings which will be positively inflicted by God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Lord three times in one discourse repeats that awful declaration,
        ‘Their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.’ The term fire
        presents the idea of the intensity of the wrath or vengeance of God. It
        denotes that the sufferings of the condemned sinner are such as the body
        experiences from material fire, and that entire desolation which
        accompanies its devouring flames. Fire, however, consumes the matter on
        which it acts, and is thus itself extinguished. But it is not so with
        those who shall be delivered over to that fire which is not quenched.
        They will be upheld in existence by Divine justice, as the subjects on
        which it will be ever displayed. The expression, ‘their worm dieth not,’
        indicates a continuance of pain and putrefaction such as the gnawing of
        worms would produce. As fire is extinguished when its fuel is consumed,
        in the same way the worm dies when the subject on which it subsists is
        destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here it is represented as never dying, because the persons of the
        wicked are supported for the endurance of this punishment. In employing
        these figures, the Lord seems to refer to the two methods in which the
        bodies of the dead were in former times consigned to darkness and
        oblivion, either by in cremation or interment. In the first, they were
        consumed by fire; in the second, devoured by worms. The final punishment
        of the enemies of God is likewise represented by their being cast into
        the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. This imports the
        multitude of griefs with which the wicked will be overwhelmed. What
        emblem can more strikingly portray the place of torment than the tossing
        waves, not merely of a flood of waters, but of liquid fire? And what can
        describe more awfully the intensity of the sufferings of those who are
        condemned, than the image of that brimstone by which the fierceness of
        fire is augmented?
      </p>
      <p>
        These expressions, their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched,
        to which it is added, ‘for every one shall be salted with fire,’
        preclude every idea either of annihilation or of a future restoration to
        happiness. Under the law, the victims offered in sacrifice were
        appointed to be salted with salt, called ‘the salt of the covenant,’
        Leviticus 2:13. Salt is an emblem of incorruptibility, and its
        employment announced the perpetuity of the covenant of God with His
        people. In the same manner, all the sacrifices to His justice will be
        salted with fire. Every sinner will be preserved by the fire itself;
        becoming thereby incorruptible, and fitted to endure those torments to
        which he is destined. The just vengeance of God will render
        incorruptible the children of wrath, whose misery, any more than the
        blessedness of the righteous, will never come to an end. ‘The Son of
        Man,’ said Jesus, ‘goeth, as it is written of Him; but woe unto that man
        by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he
        had not been born.’ If the punishment of the wicked in the future state
        were to terminate in a period, however remote, and were it to be
        followed with eternal happiness, what is here affirmed of Judas would
        not be true. A great gulf is fixed between the abodes of blessedness and
        misery, and every passage from the one to the other is for ever barred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The punishment, then, of the wicked will be eternal, according to the
        figures employed, as well as to the express declarations of Scripture.
        Sin being committed against the infinity of God, merits an infinite
        punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the natural order of justice, this punishment ought to be infinitely
        great; but as that is impossible, since the creature is incapable of
        suffering pain in an infinite degree, infinity in greatness is
        compensated by infinity in duration. The punishment, then, is finite in
        itself, and on this account it is capable of being inflicted in a
        greater or less degree; but as it is eternal, it bears the same
        proportion to the greatness of Him who is offended.
      </p>
      <p>
        The metaphors and comparisons employed in Scripture to describe the
        intensity of the punishment of the wicked, are calculated deeply to
        impress the sentiment of the awful nature of that final retribution.
        ‘Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath
        made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the
        breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it,’ Isaiah
        30:33.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the doctrine of eternal happiness is generally admitted, the
        eternity of future punishment is doubted by many. The declarations,
        however, of the Holy Scriptures respecting both are equally explicit.
        Concerning each of them the very same expressions are used. ‘These shall
        go away into everlasting (literally, eternal) punishment: but the
        righteous unto life eternal,’ Matthew 25:46. Owing to the hardness of
        their hearts, men are insensible to the great evil of sin. Hence the
        threatenings of future punishment, according to the word of God, shock
        all their prejudices, and seem to them unjust, and such as never can be
        realized. The tempter said to the woman, ‘Ye shall not surely die, ’
        although God had declared it. In the same way that malignant deceiver
        now suggests that the doctrine of eternal punishment, although written
        as with a sunbeam in the book of God, although expressly affirmed by the
        Savior in the description of the last judgment, and so often repeated by
        Him during His abode on earth, is contrary to every idea that men ought
        to entertain of the goodness and mercy of God. He conceals from his
        votaries the fact that if God is merciful He is also just; and that,
        while forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin, He will by no
        means clear the guilty. Some who act as His servants in promoting this
        delusion, have admitted that the Scriptures do indeed threaten
        everlasting punishment to transgressors, but they say that God employs
        such threatenings as a veil to deter men from sin, while He by no means
        intends their execution. The veil, then, which God has provided, is,
        according to them, too transparent to answer the purpose He designs, and
        they, in their superior wisdom, have been able to penetrate it. And this
        is one of their apologies for the Bible, with the design of making its
        doctrines more palatable to the world. On their own principles, then,
        they are chargeable with doing all in their power to frustrate what they
        affirm to be a provision of mercy. Shall men, however eminent in the
        world, be for a moment listened to, who stand confessedly guilty of
        conduct so impious?
      </p>
      <p>
        Infinitely great are the obligations of believers to that grace by which
        they have been made to differ from others, to flee to the refuge set
        before them in the Gospel, and to wait for the Son of God from heaven,
        whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the
        wrath to come. Eternal life. — Of the nature of that glory of which the
        people of God shall be put in possession in the day of their redemption,
        we cannot form a clear and distinct idea. ‘It doth not yet appear what
        we shall be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like
        Him, for we shall see Him as He is.’ In the present state, believers,
        beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same
        image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. This
        transformation, while they see only through a glass darkly, is gradually
        proceeding; but when they see face to face, and shall know even as they
        are known, this image shall be perfected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their blessedness will consist in a knowledge of God and His mysteries,
        a full and exquisite sense of His love, ineffable consolation, profound
        tranquillity of soul, a perfect concord and harmony of the soul with the
        body, and with all the powers of the soul among themselves; in one word,
        in an assemblage of all sorts of blessings. These blessings will not be
        measured in the proportion of the creatures who receive them, but of God
        who confers them; and of the dignity of the person of Jesus Christ, and
        of His merit: of His person, for they shall obtain that felicity only in
        virtue of the communion which they have with Him; of His merit, for He
        has purchased it with the price of His blood. So far, then, as we can
        conceive of majesty, excellency, and glory, in the person of the
        Redeemer, so far, keeping always in view the proportion of the creature
        to the Creator, ought we to conceive of the value, the excellence, and
        the abundance of the eternal blessings which He will bestow upon His
        people. The Scriptures call it a fullness of satisfaction, not a
        fullness of satiety, but a fullness of joy, at the right hand of God,
        where there are pleasures for evermore. It will be a crown of
        righteousness; they shall sit down with Christ in His throne, as He is
        set down with His Father in His throne. ‘Blessed are they which are
        called unto the marriage-supper of the Lamb.’
      </p>
      <p>
        As to the duration of this blessedness, it shall be eternal. But why
        eternal?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because God will bestow it upon a supernatural principle, and
        consequently upon a principle free from changes to which nature is
        exposed, in opposition to the happiness of Adam, which was natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because God will give it, not as to hirelings, but as to His children in
        title of inheritance. ‘The servant,’ or the hireling, says Jesus Christ,
        ‘abideth not in the house for ever, but the son abideth ever.’ Because
        God will confer it as a donation, that is to say, irrevocably. On this
        account Paul declares that ‘the gift of God is eternal life.’ None of
        the causes which produce changes will have place in heaven; — not the
        inequality of nature, for it shall be swallowed up in glory — not sin,
        for it will be entirely abolished — not the temptations of Satan, for
        Satan will have no entrance there — not the mutability of the creature,
        for God will possess His people fully and perfectly. Through Jesus
        Christ. — Eternal life comes to the people of God as a free gift, yet it
        is through Jesus Christ. By His mediation alone reconciliation between
        God and man is effected, peace established, communion restored, and
        every blessing conferred. The smallest as well as the greatest gift is
        bestowed through Him; and they are not the less free gifts from God,
        because Christ our Lord has paid the price of redemption. He Himself was
        given for this end by the Father, and He and the Father are one. He,
        then, who pays the ransom is one and the same who justifies, so that the
        freeness of the gift is not in the smallest degree diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gift of eternal life is bestowed through Jesus Christ, and by Him
        it is dispensed, — ’Glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son may also glorify Thee:
        as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to as
        many as Thou hast given Him.’ ‘My sheep hear My voice, and I know them,
        and they follow Me, and I give unto them eternal life.’ Our Lord. — His
        people are constantly to keep in mind that Jesus Christ is their Lord,
        whose authority they are ever to regard, and whom, as their Lord and
        Master, they are implicitly to obey. He is the Lord both of the dead and
        the living, to whom every knee shall bow, and before whose judgment-seat
        we shall all stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a striking similarity between the manner in which the Apostle
        winds up his discussion on the free justification of sinners, in the
        close of the preceding chapter, and that in which he now concludes the
        doctrine of their sanctification. ‘Grace,’ he there says, reigns
        ‘through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord;’
        and through Him, it is here said, ‘the gift of God is eternal life.’ All
        is of grace, all is a free gift, all is vouchsafed through and in Him
        who was delivered for our offenses, and raised again for our
        justification, from whom neither death nor life shall separate us.
        ‘Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctrine of free justification by faith without works, on which the
        Apostle had been insisting in the preceding part of the Epistle, is
        vindicated in this chapter from the charge of producing those
        consequences which are ascribed to it by the wisdom of the world, and by
        all who are opposed to the Gospel. Far from conducting to
        licentiousness, as many venture to affirm, it stands inseparably
        connected with the sanctification of the children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the conclusion of the preceding chapter, Paul had asserted that, as
        the reign of sin had been terminated by the death of the Redeemer, so
        the reign of grace, through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus
        Christ our Lord, has succeeded. He had shown in the third and fourth
        chapters that this righteousness is upon all them that believe, who are
        thus justified freely by grace. In the fifth chapter, he had exhibited
        the effects and accompaniments of their justification. The objection
        which he had seen it proper to introduce in the beginning of this sixth
        chapter, had led to a further development of the way in which these
        blessed effects are produced. In order to this, he says nothing, as has
        been observed, of the character or attainments of believers, but simply
        describes their state before God, in consequence of their union with
        Christ. The sanctification of believers, he thus shows, proceeds from
        the sovereign determination, the eternal purpose, and the irresistible
        power of God, which are exerted according to His everlasting covenant,
        through the mediation of His beloved Son, and in consistency with every
        part of the plan of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this, however, is the truth — truth so consolatory to every
        Christian — it is an incumbent duty to consider, and to seek to give
        effect to those motives to holiness, presented by the Spirit of God in
        His own word, as the means which He employs to carry on this great work
        in the soul — presented, too, in those very doctrines which the wisdom
        of the world has always supposed will lead to licentiousness. Every view
        of the character of God, and every part of the plan of salvation, tends
        to promote holiness in His people; and on every doctrine contained in
        the Scriptures, holiness is conspicuously inscribed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctrine of justification without works, so far from leading to
        licentiousness, furnishes the most powerful motive to obedience to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        They who receive the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of
        God, have the fullest and most awful sense of the obligation which the
        holy law of God enforces on His creatures, and of the extent and purity
        of that law connected with the most profound sentiment of the evil of
        sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every new view that believers take of the Gospel of their salvation is
        calculated to impress on their minds a hatred of sin, and a desire to
        flee from it. In the doctrine of Christ crucified, they perceive that
        God, who is holy and just, pardons nothing without an atonement, and
        manifests His hatred of sin by the plan which He adopts for the
        salvation of sinners. The extent of the evil of sin is exhibited in the
        dignity and glory of Him by whom it has been expiated, the depth of His
        humiliation, and the greatness of His sufferings. The obligation of the
        law of God also derives unutterable force from the purity of its
        precepts as well as from the awfulness of its sanction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the principal object, or one of the essential characteristics, of the
        doctrine of justification by faith was to represent God as easily
        pacified towards the guilty, as taking a superficial cognizance of the
        breach of His holy law, and punishing it lightly, it might with reason
        be concluded that it relaxes the bonds of moral obligation. But far from
        this, that doctrine maintains in the highest degree the holiness of God,
        and discovers the danger of continuing in sin. It teaches that, even
        when the Almighty is determined to show compassion to the sinner, He
        cannot deny Himself, and therefore His justice must be satisfied. That
        Jesus Christ should have purchased, at the price of His own blood, a
        license to sin against God, would be utterly incompatible with the
        wisdom and uniformity of the Divine government. God cannot hate sin
        before its expiation by His Son, and love it after the sufferings
        inflicted on account of it. If it behooved Him to punish sin so severely
        in the Divine Surety of His people, it can never be pleasing to Him in
        those for whom the Surety has made satisfaction. His holiness is further
        displayed by this doctrine, which teaches that it is only through a
        righteous advocate and intercessor that they who are justified have
        access to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel method of justification by the blood of Christ discovers sin
        and its fatal consequences in the most hideous aspect, while at the same
        time it displays the mercy of God in the most attractive form. Believers
        are punished with death in the person of their Divine Surety, according
        to the original and irrevocable sentence pronounced against man on
        account of his transgression. But as Jesus Christ has been raised from
        the dead by the power of the Father, they also have been raised with Him
        to walk in newness of life. They are therefore bound by every
        consideration of love and fear, of gratitude and joyful hope, to
        regulate the actions of that life which has thus been granted to them in
        a new and holy way. Being baptized into the death of Christ, in whom
        they are ‘complete,’ they ought to be conformed to Him, and to separate
        themselves from sin by its entire destruction. Their baptism, which is
        the instituted sign of their forfeiture by sin of Adam’s life, and their
        regeneration and fellowship with Christ in His death and resurrection,
        exhibit to them in the clearest manner the necessity of purity and
        holiness, the way by which these are attained conformably to the Gospel,
        and their obligation to renounce everything incompatible with the
        service of God. ‘I am crucified,’ says the Apostle Paul, ‘with Christ;
        nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life
        which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
        who loved me, and gave Himself for me.’ And, addressing the believers to
        whom he wrote, he says, ‘As many of you as have been baptized into
        Christ, have put on Christ.’ Ye are ‘buried with Him in baptism, wherein
        also ye have risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God,
        who hath raised Him from the dead,’ Colossians 2:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        These blessings believers enjoy by that faith which unites them to
        Christ, and which is wrought in their hearts by the same power that
        raised up Jesus from the dead, and that will raise them up at the last
        day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inducements, then, to love and gratitude to God, held out and
        enforced by the doctrine of justification by faith, are the strongest
        that can be conceived. The inexpressible magnitude of the blessings
        which they who are justified have received; their deliverance from
        everlasting destruction; the right they have obtained to eternal
        blessedness, and their meetness for its enjoyment; the infinite
        condescension of the great Author of these gifts, extending mercy to
        those who, so far from serving Him, have provoked His wrath; the
        astonishing means employed in the execution of His purpose of saving
        them, and the conviction which believers entertain of their own
        unworthiness, — all impose the strongest obligations, and furnish the
        most powerful motives, to walk in obedience to God. ‘We have known and
        believed,’ says the Apostle John, ‘the love that God hath to us.’ As
        long as the sinner continues to live under the burden of unpardoned
        guilt, so long as he sees Divine justice and holiness armed against him,
        he can only be actuated, in any attempt towards obedience, by servile
        fear; but when he believes the precious promises of pardon flowing from
        the love of God, when he knows the just foundation on which this pardon
        is established, he cleaves with reciprocal love to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        He rests his confidence solely on the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ,
        and ascribes to his Heavenly Father all the glory of his salvation.
        Being justified by faith, he has peace with God, which he no longer
        labors to acquire by his own works. His obedience is a constant
        expression of love and thankfulness for the free gift of that
        righteousness which the Son of God was sent to introduce, which He
        finished on the cross, and which confers a title to Divine favor
        sufficient for the most guilty of mankind. If any man professes to
        believe in Jesus Christ, to love His name, and to enjoy communion with
        God, yet obeys not His commandments, he ‘is a liar, and The truth is not
        in Him. But whose keepeth His word, in Him verily is the love of God
        perfected.’ That which does not produce obedience is not love; and what
        does not proceed from love is unworthy of the name of obedience. The
        pretense of love without obedience is hypocrisy; and obedience without
        love is a real slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sanctification of the people of God depends on the death of Christ
        in the way of its meritorious cause: for through His death they receive
        the Holy Spirit, by whom they are sanctified. Jesus Christ has also
        sanctified Himself, that He might sanctify them. — He had, indeed, no
        corruption from which He needed sanctification; but when He took on Him
        the sins of His people, they were His sins as truly as if He had been
        personally guilty. This is in accordance with what is declared, 2
        Corinthians 5:21, ‘He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin:
        that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.’ In this light,
        then, He must be sanctified from sin, and this was effected by His
        suffering death. He was sanctified from the sin He had taken upon him by
        His own blood shed upon the cross, and in Him they are sanctified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sanctification of believers depends, too, on the death of Jesus
        Christ in the way of obligation; for, having redeemed His people to
        Himself, He has laid them under an inviolable obligation to be holy.’
        ‘Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from
        your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with
        the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without
        spot.’ ‘Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body
        and in your spirit which are God’s.’ Their sanctification arises also
        from the example of Jesus Christ; for, in His death, as well as in His
        life, all Christian virtues were exhibited and exercised in a manner the
        most admirable, and set before us for our imitation. ‘Christ also
        suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow His steps’
        The sanctification of believers likewise depends on the death of Christ
        in the way of motive; for it furnishes an almost infinite number of
        motives to holiness of life. In His death, believers discover the
        profound misery in which they were plunged in the slavery of sin and
        Satan — as children of rebellion and wrath separated from the communion
        of God. To procure their deliverance, it was necessary not only that the
        Son of God should come into the world, but that He should suffer on the
        cross; whence they ought to regard their former condition with holy
        terror and abhorrence. In His death they perceive how hateful sin is in
        the sight of God, since it was necessary that the blood of an infinite
        and Divine person should be shed in order to its expiation. In that
        death they discover the ineffable love of God, which has even led to the
        delivering up of His only-begotten Son for their salvation. They
        discover the love and compassion of the Son Himself, which induced Him
        to come down from heaven to save them, which should beget reciprocal
        love, and an ardent zeal for His service.
      </p>
      <p>
        They perceive the hope of their calling, and realize the blessings of
        the eternal inheritance of God, which have been acquired by that death.
        They contemplate the honor and dignity of their adoption, for Jesus
        Christ has died that they might become the children of God. They have
        been born of His blood, which binds them never to lose sight of this
        heavenly dignity, but to conduct themselves in a manner suitable to
        their high vocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the death of Jesus Christ the eyes of believers are directed to the
        Spirit of sanctification, whom God hath sent forth; for in dying Jesus
        Christ has obtained for His people the inexhaustible graces of the Holy
        Spirit. This leads them to renounce the spirit of the world, and submit
        to the direction and guidance of the Spirit from on high. ‘They feel the
        honor of their communion with Jesus Christ, being His brethren and joint
        heirs, the members of His body, those for whom He shed His blood, and
        whom He hath redeemed at so astonishing a price. They behold the peace
        which He has made between God and them, which imposes on them the duty
        of never disturbing that blessed reconciliation, but, on the contrary,
        of rendering the most profound obedience to the Divine law. They
        discover the most powerful motives to humility; for the death of Jesus
        Christ is a mirror, in which they behold the vileness and indignity of
        their natural corruption, and perceive that they have nothing in
        themselves wherewith to satisfy Divine justice for their sins. His
        death, placing before their eyes their original condition, leads them to
        cry out before God, ‘O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto Thee; but unto
        us confusion of face.’ Our justification is a blessing which proceeds
        from Thy grace: Thou hast conferred on us the righteousness of Thy Son;
        but to ourselves belongeth nothing but misery and ruin. The death of
        Jesus Christ presents the strongest motives to repentance; for if, after
        the redemption He has wrought, they should still continue in their sins,
        it would be making Him, as the Apostle says, ‘the minister of sin.’ And,
        finally, the death of Jesus Christ teaches them not to dread their own
        death; for He hath sanctified the tomb, and rendered death itself
        innoxious to His people, since for them He has condescended to suffer it
        Himself. Their death is the last part of their fellowship on earth with
        their suffering Redeemer; and as His death was the gate through which He
        entered into His glory, so the earthly house of their tabernacle must be
        dissolved, that they may be also glorified together with Him. ‘O death,
        where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God
        which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as His death, presents the
        strongest motives for the encouragement and sanctification of believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        His resurrection establishes their faith, as being the heavenly seal
        with which God has been pleased to confirm the truth of the Gospel.
        Having been declared to be the Son of God with power by His resurrection
        from the dead, they regard Him as the Creator of the world, and the
        eternal Son of the Father. It assures them of the effect of His death in
        expiating their sins, and obliges them to embrace the blood of His cross
        as the price of their redemption. His resurrection being the victory
        which He obtained over the enemies of His Church, they are bound to
        place all their confidence in Him, and to resign themselves for ever to
        His guidance. It presents the most powerful motive to have constant
        recourse to the mercy of the Father, for having Himself raised up the
        Head and Surety of His people; it is an evident pledge of His eternal
        purpose to love them, and of their freedom of access to God by His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus Christ, believers are taught
        the certainty of their immortality and future blessedness. Lazarus, and
        others who were raised up, received their life in the same state as they
        possessed it before; and after they arose they died a second time; but
        Jesus Christ, in His resurrection, obtained a life entirely different.
        In his birth a life was communicated to Him which was soon to terminate
        on the cross. His resurrection communicated a life imperishable and
        immortal. Jesus Christ being raised from the dead, death hath no more
        dominion over him. Of this new life the Apostle speaks as being already
        enjoyed by His people. ‘He hath raised us up together, and made us sit
        together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.’ Elsewhere he calls that
        heavenly life which Jesus Christ now possesses, their life. ‘Your life
        is hid with Christ in God.’ ‘When Christ, who is our life, shall appear,
        ye also shall appear with Him in glory.’ ‘Whosoever liveth and believeth
        in Me,’ He Himself hath said, ‘shall never die.’ All this should inspire
        His people with courage to finish their course here, in order to go to
        take possession of the heavenly inheritance which He has gone before to
        prepare for them, and from whence He will come again to receive them to
        Himself. It should inspire them with fortitude, that they may not sink
        under the afflictions and trials which they experience on earth. The
        Apostle counted all things but loss and dung that he might win Christ —
        that he might know Him, and the power of His resurrection. On the
        resurrection of Jesus Christ he rests the whole value and evidence of
        the truth of the Gospel. ‘If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching
        vain, and your faith is vain.’ ‘But now is Christ risen from the dead,
        and become the first fruits of them that slept.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrection of Jesus Christ, on which believers rest their hope, is
        intimately connected with every part of the Christian religion. The
        perfections of the Father — His power, His justice, His faithfulness —
        were all engaged in raising up His Son from the grave. The constitution
        of the person of Jesus Christ Himself also required it. He was the Son
        of God, the Prince of Life, holy, and without spot, — consequently,
        having nothing in common with death. His body was joined with His deity,
        of which it was the temple, so that it could not always remain under the
        power of the grave. His resurrection was also necessary on account of
        His office as Mediator, and of the general purposes of His coming into
        the world to destroy the works of the devil, to subvert the empire of
        death, to make peace between God and man, and to bring life and
        immortality to light. It was necessary, too, in consideration of His
        office as a Prophet, in order to confirm by His resurrection the word
        which He had spoken; and of His office as a Priest, for, after having
        presented His sacrifice, He must live to intercede for His people and to
        bless them. And to reign as a King, He must first triumph personally
        Himself over all His enemies, in order to cause His people to triumph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon the whole, as in the preceding part of the Epistle, the Apostle had
        rested the justification of believers on their union with Jesus Christ,
        so upon the same union he rests in this chapter their sanctification. It
        is in virtue of this union between Him as the Head, and the Church as
        His body, that the elect of God are the subjects of His regenerating
        grace, enjoy the indwelling of his Spirit, and bring forth fruit unto
        God. ‘As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the
        vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the
        branches. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth
        much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This union of believers with Jesus Christ is represented in Scripture in
        various expressions, and by different images. The Scriptures declare
        that we are one with Him, that He dwells in our hearts, that He lives in
        us and we in Him, that we are changed into His image, and that He is
        formed in us. This union is spoken of as resembling the union of the
        head with the other parts of the body, and the foundation with the
        superstructure. This union does not result solely from Jesus Christ
        having taken upon Him, by His incarnation, the human nature. For if in
        this alone our union with Him consisted, unbelievers would be as much
        united with Him as believers. The union of believers with Jesus Christ
        is a spiritual and mystical union; and, as one with Him, by Him they are
        represented. He represents them in the act of making satisfaction to the
        Father, taking their sins upon Him, and enduring the punishment they
        deserved; for it was in their place, as their Head and Mediator, that He
        presented to God that great and solemn sacrifice which has obtained for
        them heavenly glory. He represents them in the act of His resurrection;
        for, as the Head, He has received for them of His Father life and
        immortality. He represents them in His intercession in their name, and
        also in His exaltation on His throne. The spiritual life which they
        derive from Him consists in present grace and future glory. In grace
        there are three degrees. The first is peace with God; the second is
        holiness, comprehending all that constitutes their duty; and the third
        is hope, which, like an anchor of the soul, enters into that within the
        veil. In glory there are also three degrees: the resurrection of the
        bodies of believers; their elevation to heaven; and the eternal
        enjoyment of the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the
        world.
      </p>

        Paul enjoins on Titus to affirm constantly the great truths he had been
        declaring, in order that they which have believed in God might be
        careful to maintain good works. Those doctrines alone, which, in the
        opinion of many, make void the law, and give a license to sin — against
        which, since the days of the Apostle, the same objections have been
        repeated which in this chapter Paul combats — those doctrines are the
        means which the Holy Spirit employs for the conversion of sinners, and
        for producing effects entirely the opposite in their hearts. The Bible
        teaches us that the plan of salvation, which delivers man from sin and
        from death by the death of the Son of God, which had its origin in
        eternity in the counsels of God, both as to the choice of its objects,
        and the manner in which they are justified and sanctified, and as to its
        consummation in glory, is founded wholly in grace. ‘By the grace of
        God,’ says Paul, ‘I am what I am.’ ‘Now unto Him that is able to do
        exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the
        power that worketh in us, unto Him be glory in the Church by Christ
        Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.’
