      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 11. — I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
        forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the
        Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having proved that God had not cast away His people, by referring to the
        fact that even then a remnant, according to the election of graces was
        preserved, Paul supports his denial of their rejection by the
        consideration that in process of time the whole nation shall be
        restored. This restoration, as has been already remarked, forms the
        subject of nearly the whole remainder of the chapter. I say then, Have
        they stumbled that they should fall? — This is the Apostle’s own
        question, and does not, as Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart allege, proceed
        from an imaginary objector. It naturally springs out of the declaration
        made in the four preceding verses concerning the blindness of those
        called ‘the rest,’ in contradistinction to the remnant comprehended in
        the election. The question is, ‘Has the great body of the Jewish nation
        stumbled, that they should fall for ever, and is this the purpose of
        their fall?’ Paul replies by a strong negative. Nothing was further from
        the purpose of God with respect to His ancient people. They had
        stumbled, as was said, ch. 9:32, ‘at that stumbling-stone,’ according to
        the predictions of the Prophets respecting Christ; but still it was but
        a temporary stumbling, from which the nation will finally recover. God
        had a double purpose in this. His design in their stumbling was not that
        they should fall for ever, but rather that through their fall salvation
        should come to the Gentiles, and that, through this, the nation of
        Israel might ultimately receive the Messiah. To provoke them to
        jealousy. — It is probable from this, that the Jews will be excited, by
        seeing God’s favor to the Gentiles, to reflect on their own fallen
        condition, and to desire to possess the same advantages. When the Jews
        can no longer hide from themselves that the God of their fathers is with
        the nations whom they abhor, they will be led to consider their ways,
        and brought again into the fold of Israel. This is according to the
        prophecy already quoted by the Apostle in the 19th verse of the
        preceding chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was in this manner, then, that God purposed to bring the Jewish
        nation finally to submit to Him, in order that they might receive His
        blessing; and thus in His sovereignty He overrules the fall and ruin of
        some for the salvation of others. His awful judgments against the
        audacious transgressors of His laws, warn the beholders to flee from the
        wrath to come; and, on the other hand, the conversion of men who have
        been notorious sinners, excites others to seek the salvation of Christ.
        Who can calculate what extensive, permanent, and glorious effects may
        result throughout the whole creation, and in eternal ages, from the fall
        of angels and men — from the redemption of God’s people in Christ — from
        His dispensations towards the Church and the world? Ephesians 3:9-11. We
        ought to remember that the Lord may have infinitely wise and gracious
        motives for His most severe and terrible judgments. Thus did the fall of
        the Jews become the occasion of the Gentiles being enriched with the
        inexhaustible treasures that are in Christ, so that the justice, the
        wisdom, and the faithfulness of God were glorified in this awful
        visitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Now, if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
        diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their
        fullness?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the foregoing verse, the Apostle had said that through the fall of
        the Jews salvation was come to the Gentiles; he had also intimated that
        they should be recovered from their fall. This might lead the Gentiles
        to apprehend that, in the restoration of the Jews, they might in like
        manner he cast off. To this Paul now answers, that, on the contrary, if
        the fall of the Jews be the riches of the Gentiles, much more so will be
        their restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temporary fall of the Jews was fraught with the richest blessings to
        the rest of the world. Their rejection of the Messiah was the occasion
        of the assuring of the great sacrifice for sin, and of the Gospel being
        preached to all nations. In consequence of their rejecting the testimony
        of the Apostles, the remnant who believed fled from the persecution of
        their countrymen, and, being scattered abroad, went everywhere preaching
        the word. Besides, the Jewish nation, which had been constituted the
        witnesses of God, Isaiah 43:10, and to whom the oracles of God had been
        committed, have firmly preserved their sacred trust, even amidst all
        their unbelief and consequent sufferings. In this we discern an
        illustrious proof of the Divine origin of the Old Testament Scriptures
        which testify of the Messiah; while the preservation of the Jews as a
        distinct people amidst and the changes and revolutions of ages, stands
        forth a lasting miracle, not to be explained on natural principles,
        furnishing incontestable evidence of the truth of the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the diminishing of the Jews was the aggrandizement of the Gentiles;
        for, in the inscrutable counsels of Jehovah, His gift of salvation to
        them was connected with the degradation and downfall of His ancient
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here the Apostle goes the assurance that the fullness of the Jews —
        their restoration as a body, when they shall acknowledge Christ as the
        Messiah — will yet prove a far greater blessing to the Gentiles. It will
        be connected with a calling of the nations to an extent beyond anything
        yet witnessed, and also with a great enlargement of their knowledge of
        the Gospel. This was consistent with what is said in the sequel of that
        prediction to which Paul had just referred. In the same way, Moses,
        after foretelling the many evils that were to come upon his nation, and
        of the calamities that were to be heaped upon them, concludes the whole
        by predicting all that the Apostle here declares: ‘Rejoice, O ye
        nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants,
        and will render vengeance to His adversaries, and wise be merciful unto
        His land and to His people,’ Deuteronomy 32:43.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the Apostle of
        the gentiles, I magnify mine office: The Apostle continues, to the
        beginning of the 16th verse, to amplify still further what he had just
        announced, in proof that the salvation of the Gentiles is closely
        connected with God’s dealings towards the Jews. The Gentiles were
        largely blessed with the Gospel when it was rejected by the Jews; but
        they will be blessed with it to an unspeakably greater extent when the
        Jews shall be recalled. Paul was the Apostle of the Gentiles, and by
        uttering this prediction with regard to the Gentiles, at the period of
        the restoration of the Jews, he says he magnifies his office. He here
        addresses himself particularly to those in the church at Rome, who were
        of the Gentiles. For as he had been appointed their Apostle, he was
        desirous to commend his ministry among them, to assert the honor of his
        commission, and to prove its great importance in imparting to them the
        knowledge of the Gospel. He shows, with regard to the Gentiles, that its
        value was enhanced in proportion as a greater number of Gentiles will be
        saved. In this view, it is greatly for the interest of the Gentiles that
        the Jews should be brought back, and this should increase their efforts
        for their conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my
        flesh, and might save some of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle also desired to excite the attention of his countrymen by
        this view of Divine favor to the Gentiles. He endeavored to move them to
        emulation, that in this way they might be directed to Christ the Savior
        of sinners, and that some of them might be saved. He says some, not all,
        for he was aware that the body of the nation was at that time rejected,
        but he knew not who among them were of the remnant according to the
        election of grace, who, although still rejecting the Messiah, might, by
        means of the Gospel which he preached, be finally saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the
        world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the Apostle further explains and illustrates the argument he had
        employed in the 12th verse. The Gospel was preached to the world only
        after Israel rejected it. This was not the result of accident; it was
        according to the fixed purpose of God. The middle wall of partition was
        then broken down. The command was given to preach the Gospel to every
        creature.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the great sacrifice had been offered, it was no longer to be
        limited to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The world was to hear
        the Gospel; and thus the Gentiles received the grace of God only through
        the unbelief and rejection of the Jewish nation. But if the casting away
        of the Jews was such a blessing to the world, their recall will be a
        blessing unspeakably greater. It will occasion a revival among the
        Gentile churches, from a dead and almost lifeless state, which will
        resemble a resurrection. The numbers then converted will be as if all
        the dead had risen out of their graves. The Divine dispensations being
        at that period so far developed, and the prophecies respecting the
        rejection and restoration of the Jews so fully accomplished, no doubt
        will any longer be entertained regarding the Divine origin of the Holy
        Scriptures. A great additional light, too, will be thrown on those parts
        of them which at present are most obscure, so that, in the providence of
        God, the result will be an unexampled blessing both to Jews and
        Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — For if the first-fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if
        the root be holy, so are the branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole of the Apostle’s argument goes to establish the restoration of
        Israel. He shows that they were not cast off, — first, by his own
        example; and, secondly, by referring to the remnant among them according
        to the election of grace, which proved that they were not devoted to
        destruction like Sodom and Gomorrah, ch. 9:29. It was true that the
        predictions of which he had spoken were fulfilled; but although,
        consistently with these, they had stumbled, it was not that they should
        irrevocably fall; but this was the way in which God had appointed
        salvation to come to the Gentiles. Even in this, however, God had their
        restoration in view; for the kindness shown to the Gentiles would be the
        means of provoking their jealousy, and great as were the benefits which
        accrued to the world from their fall, those of their restoration would
        be still greater. The verse before us contains a third argument to prove
        the future conversion of the Jewish nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here employs two similitudes, one taken from the law,
        respecting the first-fruits, by which the whole of the harvest was
        sanctified; and the other from nature, by which, under the figure of a
        tree, he evidences the truth he is exhibiting respecting the final
        restoration of the whole nation of Israel. By the first-fruit some
        understand the first Jewish converts; but it rather appears that both
        the first-fruit and the root refer to Abraham, as the first-fruit to
        God, and the root of the Jewish nation. As Abraham was separated to the
        service of God, so, in the sense of a relative holiness, all his
        descendants in the line of Isaac were holy, standing in an external
        relation to God in which no other nation ever stood. But Abraham was
        also personally holy; and so, in every age, had been many of his
        descendants through the heir of promise; and so, also, shall be an
        innumerable multitude of them hereafter. For, according to the figure
        here employed, they shall as branches be grafted in again, and so all
        Israel shall be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is therefore here shown that the future conversion of Israel is
        guaranteed by the peculiar covenant relation in which they stand to
        Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the whole nation had never been internally holy, they had all
        along been in a peculiar manner separated or consecrated to God, in the
        same way as, according to the law, the first-fruits of the harvest were
        consecrated; for when the corn was kneaded, a cake of the first of the
        dough was to be given to the Lord, Numbers 15:19-21; and thus the whole
        of the harvest was set apart or sanctified, 1 Timothy 4:5. On this
        ground, Moses, even when reminding the Israelites of their unhallowed
        rebellion against God in the wilderness, declared, ‘Thou art a holy
        people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a
        special people unto Himself,’ Deuteronomy 7:6. And a little after, when
        rehearsing to them their several rebellions, and informing them that the
        Lord had pronounced them to be ‘a stiff-necked people,’ and when he
        claims the heavens and the earth, and all that they contain, as the
        property of Jehovah, he says to Israel, ‘The Lord had a delight in thy
        fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you,
        above all people,’ Deuteronomy 10:15, and Deuteronomy 4:37, 14:2, 26:19,
        and 32:8, 9. ‘God,’ it is also said, ‘heard their groanings, and God
        remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And
        God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them,’
        Exodus 2:24. Moses assured the people, the Lord ‘will not forsake thee,
        neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which He
        swore unto them,’ Deuteronomy 4:31. And it is said by the Prophet Isaiah
        43:21, ‘This people have I formed for Myself.’ In like manner, when
        Samuel was in the strongest terms reproaching Israel for their
        rebellion, in forsaking the Lord and choosing a king, he still exhorts
        them to serve the Lord, notwithstanding their past wickedness. ‘For,’ he
        adds, ‘the Lord will not forsake His people for His great name’s sake;
        because it hath pleased the Lord to make you His people,’ 1 Samuel
        12:22. Innumerable declarations to the same effect are interspersed
        throughout the Old Testament. The Apostle’s argument then is, that as
        the lump is holy through the offering of the first-fruit, and as the
        tree derives its character from the root, so the descendants of Abraham,
        Isaac, and Jacob, whom the Lord chose, were set apart by solemn covenant
        for His service and glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In consequence of God’s love to the fathers, He delivered them from
        Egypt, and separated them by the Sinai covenant from all other nations
        as His peculiar people. But while that transaction announced the most
        important purposes, it was not faultless, Hebrews 8:7. It pointed out
        their duty, but did not communicate those dispositions which are
        essential to obedience. It was therefore only a figure for the time then
        present, imposed on them for a season, Hebrews 9:9,10, and intended to
        be introductory to a better covenant established upon better promises,
        by which the law was to be put in their inward parts, and God was to be
        a God to them in a higher sense than He was by that first covenant. This
        was taught them in the land of Moab, where God promised to circumcise
        their heart and the heart of their seed, and is repeated by Isaiah
        59:21, Jeremiah 31:31, and referred to by the Apostle in the 26th and
        27th verses of the chapter before us. Thus Israel has been set apart as
        a holy people, devoted to the service of God, since the call of Abraham.
        Their unbelief has not made the faithfulness of God of none effect.
        Their rebellions have all been subservient to His eternal purpose. The
        tree was of the Lord’s right-hand planting, a noble vine; many of the
        branches have been broken off, but still the root remains, bound round,
        as it were, ‘with a band of iron and brass;’ and the branches shall be
        grafted in again, by their partaking of the faith of Abraham. And as
        they were God’s witnesses when enjoying His blessing in the land of
        Canaan, Isaiah 43:10,12, 44:8, and are His witnesses in their rejection,
        and in being ‘left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an
        ensign on a hill,’ Isaiah 30:17, so shall they be His witnesses in their
        restoration. In God’s treatment of them we see His abhorrence of sin. In
        them we behold a memorial of the severity of God, Romans 11:22; but in
        them shall also be witnessed a nobler monument of His goodness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle’s argument, then, amounts to this — that as the lump is
        holy, through the offering of the first-fruits, so this is a pledge that
        the lump, or body of the nation, will yet be made holy. The restoration
        of Israel is not only plainly asserted by the Apostle here, but it is
        essential to the fulfillment of the parable exhibited in God’s dealings
        with the nation of Israel. That nation was a type of the true Israel,
        and in God’s dealings with them all the great doctrines of the Gospel
        are exhibited. It was therefore necessary that Israel should be
        restored, otherwise the parable which shadows forth the final
        preservation of the people of God, declared in Romans 8:35, would have
        been incomplete. We see the sovereignty of God in choosing Israel, in
        bestowing on them so many advantages, in punishing them so severely, and
        making the whole to redound to His own glory and the salvation of all
        who are ordained to eternal life. They have been the chosen instruments
        employed for the salvation of the world; and their last end, after all
        their wanderings, and all their rebellions, and all their unbelief,
        shall exhibit them as the true circumcision, who rejoice in Christ
        Jesus. When, therefore, the calling of the Gentiles and the rebellion of
        Israel are announced in the strongest terms, it is immediately added,
        ‘Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one
        saith, destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for My
        servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all. And I will bring forth
        a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains; and
        Mine elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there,’ Isaiah
        65:8. ‘As a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when
        they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the substance
        thereof,’ Isaiah 6:13. All this accords with those repeated declarations
        of Scripture already referred to, in which it is said that the Lord will
        never forsake His people, for His great name’s sake. It likewise accords
        with the numerous and peculiar privileges conferred on Israel as a
        nation, as enumerated in the ninth chapter of this Epistle, and summed
        up in these words, ‘Whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning
        the flesh, Christ came.’ And consistently with the whole, it is declared
        in the sequel of the chapter before us, that the time is coming when all
        Israel shall be saved, and the natural branches, or descendants of
        Abraham, shall be grafted in again into their own olive tree. On these
        grounds it is evident that, while those whom the Apostle calls the
        ‘rest’ of Israel, had in the meantime fallen, and although successive
        generations should behold Jerusalem forsaken, and Israel wandering
        without a home through the world, yet the restoration of the nation
        shall hereafter testify the unchangeable faithfulness of that God who,
        in dividing to the nations their inheritance, ‘set the bounds of the
        people, according to the number of the children of Israel.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Such is the method by which the Apostle in this verse continues to
        substantiate his declaration that God had not cast away His people. He
        had shown that their destruction could not have been intended, since a
        remnant was preserved; and he is now proving that, as a body, they shall
        finally be restored to God’s favor. In declaring the peculiar privileges
        of Israel, derived from their first progenitors, the Apostle, by
        exhibiting their distinguished superiority over all other nations, lays
        a foundation for the forcible warnings which, down to the 23rd verse, he
        proceeds to deliver to the Gentiles who had been received into the
        covenant of God. Mr. Stuart remarks of this 16th verse, that it is
        illustration rather than argument; but it is an illustration which has
        been adopted by the Spirit of God as a pledge of the event. If it be not
        argument, it is evidence, and is recorded as a revelation of the Divine
        purpose, that the lump, or body of the nation of Israel, shall yet be
        holy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
        wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partakest of
        the root and fatness of the olive tree; Before alleging anything further
        to prove the future conversion of the Jews, Paul here, and onwards to
        the 25th verse, continues to employ the figure of a tree and its
        branches. In doing so, he takes occasion to administer a salutary
        caution to the Gentile believers. In this and the following verses, down
        to the 25th, he warns them to beware of self preference, or of being
        puffed up against the Jews, on account of the blessings with which they
        themselves were now favored. The Jewish nation was God’s olive tree.
        They were all the people of God in a typical sense, and the greater part
        of God’s true people had been chosen out of them; but now, by their
        unbelief, some of the branches were broken off from the tree. By the
        term ‘some,’ as has been observed, verse 14, is meant not all, Hebrews
        3:16; for it implies that others, as the Apostle had shown, verses 2-5,
        remained. And among, or rather instead of, those that were broken off,
        the Gentiles, who were a wild olive, having had no place in the good
        olive tree, are now made the children of Abraham by faith in Christ
        Jesus, Galatians 3:26-29. They were grafted into the good olive tree,
        whose root Abraham was, and were made partakers of his distinguished
        privileges. It has sometimes been remarked that there is no grafting in
        the olive tree. But this makes no difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        The illustration from the process of grafting is the same, whether the
        operation be performed in the particular tree mentioned or not. Mr.
        Stuart says that the wild olive ‘was often grafted into the fruitful one
        when it began to decay, and thus not only brought fruit, but caused the
        decaying olive to revive and flourish.’ This, however, whether it be
        fact or not, is not to the purpose of the Apostle, for he is beating
        down the arrogance of the Gentile believers, and not pointing out the
        advantages they occasioned to Jews. Nor is the stock of the olive here
        supposed to be decayed, but to be full of sap and fatness, to partake of
        which, and not to benefit the fruitful olive, is the wild olive grafted
        into the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — Boast not against the branches: but if thou boast, thou
        bearest not the root, but the root thee.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is probable, from what is here said, that even in the Apostle’s time
        the Gentile believers were beginning to exhibit an overbearing
        disposition towards the Jews, and a complacent feeling of
        self-preference. At all events, the sin against which they are thus
        warned well describes the spirit that has long prevailed among the
        Gentiles who profess Christianity. What marvelous ignorance, folly, and
        vanity, are often displayed even in God’s people! Nothing but the
        constant lessons of the Spirit of God will teach them that all spiritual
        difference among men is by God’s grace. But if thou boast. — Whenever
        Gentile Christians feel a disposition to boast with respect to the Jews,
        let them remember not only that the Jews were first the people of God,
        but that the first Christians were also Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews received no advantage from the Gentiles; but, on the contrary,
        the Gentiles have received much from the Jews, from whom the Gospel
        sounded out — its first preachers being Jews, and of whom even Christ
        Himself, as concerning the flesh, came. The Gentile believers become the
        children of Abraham, and all the blessings they enjoy are in virtue of
        that relation. Hence the covenant, Jeremiah 31:31, includes all
        believers; yet it is said only to be made with the house of Israel and
        Judah.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off that I might
        be graced in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
        standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gentile believers might reply, that the branches were broken off to
        give place to them, and in a certain sense this is admitted by the
        Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        But unbelief was the cause of the fall of the Jews, while it is by faith
        only that the Gentiles stand. It was not, then, on account of their
        superior merits that they were grafted into the good olive tree, since
        faith is the gift of God, bestowed on whom He will, and therefore leaves
        no room for boasting or self-preference. Among the Gentiles who
        professed the faith, there was soon a great falling away, and ‘the man
        of sin,’ though he boasts of being exclusively the good olive tree — the
        only true church — is broken off altogether, and doomed to inevitable
        destruction. It becomes all Christians to be humble, and to fear lest
        they also fall by error of the same kind. It is very usual, when they
        perceive the errors of other Christians, to glory over them. This is
        highly unbecoming. If a Christian understands any part of the will of
        God of which his brethren are still ignorant, it is God that has made
        the difference. A haughty spirit goeth before a fall; and if arrogance
        be indulged by any one, it is likely that God will give him up to some
        error as pernicious as that into which others whom he despises have
        fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest He
        also spare not thee.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse contains another argument by which the Apostle urges the
        Gentile believers to humility and watchfulness. If the natural branches
        were not spared, this was an additional reason why those whom He
        addressed should be on their guard lest they also should fall through
        unbelief. It appears also to be a prophetical intimation of the apostasy
        of the great body of the professors of Christianity under the mystery of
        iniquity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
        which fell severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou continue in His
        goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle lastly enforces his warning to the Gentile believers by four
        concluding arguments: First, he calls on them to behold the severity of
        God’s strict justice in cutting off and casting out the unbelieving
        Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, to consider His goodness in conferring unmerited favor on the
        Gentiles, who had attained that righteousness after which they were not
        following. Third, to remark the necessity of continuing in that
        goodness, by abiding in the faith of the Gospel; and, Fourth, to observe
        the assurance that if they abide not in the faith, they should be
        themselves cut off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men generally form in their imagination the character of God according
        to their own inclination. It is the duty of the Christian to take God’s
        character as it is given by Himself. His goodness is no evidence that He
        will not punish the guilty; and the most dreadful punishment of the
        guilty is consistent with the existence of supreme goodness in the
        Divine character. That God will yet lay righteousness to the line, and
        judgment to the plummet, is now seen in His treatment of Israel, whom He
        had so long spared after they had sinned against Him. Let none imagine,
        then, that He will spare them if guilty, because they have the name of
        being His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather let them dread the more terrible vengeance on that account. The
        evidence that we are the true objects of the goodness of God here
        mentioned, is, that we continue in it, by continuing in the faith of the
        Gospel. Continuing in goodness is not to be understood here to mean, our
        continuing in a state of integrity, according to Mr. Stuart. There is no
        real difficulty in the expression, continuing in God’s goodness. We
        continue in God’s goodness, by continuing in the faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
        grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle having, from the beginning of the 17th verse, pressed upon
        the believing Gentiles the necessity of humility, now reverts to the
        subject of the future conversion of the Jews. In order to furnish a new
        proof of this great event, he introduces a fourth argument (see
        exposition of verse 16), taken from the power of God. God is able to
        graft them in again. — According to the figure which the Apostle had
        been employing respecting the casting off and the restoration of that
        part of the Jewish nation that was blinded, comparing them to branches
        broken off, there might seem to be no probability that they could be
        restored. When branches are severed from a tree, they wither and cannot
        be replaced. Paul, therefore, here refers to the power of God. What is
        not done in nature, and cannot be effected by the power of man, will be
        done by God, with whom all things are possible. He is able to make the
        dry bones live, and to restore the severed branches of the Jewish
        nation. Some argue that, because the grafting of the Jews into the olive
        tree here spoken of is conditional, it is not promised.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Apostle’s design is evidently, even in this verse, to excite
        hopes by showing its possibility. There is no other ground of exclusion
        with respect to them but unbelief. If that sin were subdued, they would
        be received. God is able to graft them in if they believe, and He is
        able also to give them faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
        nature, and wert graced contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how
        much more shall these which be the natural branches, be grafted into
        their own olive tree?
      </p>
      <p>
        The former argument, drawn from God’s power, is here further insisted
        on. The Jews were so obstinately prejudiced against the Gospel, that it
        seemed very improbable that they should ever embrace the truth. But the
        Apostle had declared the possibility of this being accomplished by the
        mighty power of God. He now shows its probability. If the Gentiles, he
        says, who were strangers to the covenants of promise, have been grafted
        into the good olive tree, how much more is it to be expected that the
        descendants of the patriarchs, to whom the promises were made, and who
        are therefore the natural branches, shall be grafted into their own
        olive tree?
