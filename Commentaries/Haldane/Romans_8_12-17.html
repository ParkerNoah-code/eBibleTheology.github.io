      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
        live after the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a consequence drawn from what the Apostle had said with
        reference to the state of enmity against God, and of the death of those
        who are in the flesh; and likewise from what He had been showing to be
        the great privilege of believers, as being not in the flesh but in the
        Spirit; as having the Spirit of God dwelling in them; and not only
        giving life to their souls, but securing the future quickening and
        raising of their bodies. From all this he infers their obligation to
        live a holy life, in walking according to the Spirit in the character
        which he had shown belonged to them. They were not then debtors to the
        flesh — the state in which they had been by nature, which is a state of
        corruption, guilt, and weakness — to live after the flesh, either to
        expect life from its best efforts, or to obey it in its lusts. The ways
        of the flesh promise happiness, but misery is their reward. On the
        contrary, it is implied that they were debtors to God, to whom they were
        under so great obligations as being redeemed from the law of sin and
        death, to serve and obey Him, in walking according to the Spirit, in
        that new and Divine nature which He has graciously imparted to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
        through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
      </p>
      <p>
        For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. — The reason in the former
        verse why those to whom the Apostle wrote were not debtors to live after
        the flesh — under any obligation to obey its dictates — was taken from
        their obligations to God in respect of their privileges; here it is
        taken from the doom of those who thus live. If ye live agreeably to your
        carnal nature, without Christ and faith in Him, and according to the
        corrupt principles that belong to man in the state in which he is born,
        ye shall die. Ye shall suffer all the misery that throughout eternity
        shall be the portion of the wicked, which is called death, as death is
        the greatest evil in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the wrath of God is denounced against all who do not live to God,
        in obedience to His commands, but serve the lusts of the flesh, and do
        not seek salvation in the way He has appointed, however harmless and
        even useful they may be in society. At the same time, this proves that
        nothing done by the natural man, in his best efforts and highest
        attainments, will lead to God and to life. The Apostle thus repeats what
        he had affirmed in the sixth verse, that to be carnally minded is death.
        But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of this body. — The
        deeds of the body are the works which corrupt nature produces. The
        believer neither indulges nor walks according to them, but mortifies and
        puts them to death. Those to whom the Apostle wrote had mortified the
        deeds of the body, yet they are here called to a further mortification
        of them, which imports that this is both a gradual work, and to be
        continued and persevered in while we are in the world. This shows that
        the sanctification of the believer is progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some have objected to the doctrine of progressive sanctification, and
        have conceived that to assert it is a great error. They hold that there
        is no more progress in sanctification than there is in justification,
        and that both are complete at once on believing the truth. There is just
        so much truth in this as serves to make the error plausible. It is true
        that there is a sense in which believers are perfectly sanctified from
        the moment they believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        That sanctification, however, is not in themselves; it is in Christ, as
        much as their justification. The moment they believe, they are justified
        in Christ and perfectly righteous; and the moment they believe, they are
        sanctified in Him, and in Him are perfectly holy. Viewed in Christ, they
        are ‘complete.’ But there is a personal sanctification, which commences
        with the new birth on believing the truth, and which is not perfected
        till death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many passages of Scripture import this doctrine. The following prayer of
        the Apostle is explicit and decisive: — ’And the very God of peace
        sanctify you wholly,’ 1 Thessalonians 5:23. The Apostle Peter enjoins on
        believers to desire the pure milk of the word, that they may grow
        thereby, and begins his second Epistle by praying that grace might be
        multiplied to those to whom he wrote, and concludes it by enjoining on
        them to grow in grace. ‘The path of the just is as the shining light,
        that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers obtain sanctification by the Spirit through the truth. Their
        sanctification, then, must be in proportion as the truth is understood
        and believed. It is through faith in Christ, Acts 26:18; if so,
        according to the degree of faith will be the degree of sanctification.
        But all Christians are not equal in faith, neither, then, are they equal
        in sanctification; and as a Christian advances in faith, he advances in
        sanctification. If he may say, ‘Lord, increase my faith,’ he may
        likewise say, ‘Lord, increase my sanctification.’ He receives the Holy
        Spirit only in a measure. He may and ought, therefore, to pray for a
        larger measure of influence and grace from Him who gives grace in that
        measure which pleases Him. We should pray that God would grant unto us
        according to the riches of His glory, that we may be strengthened with
        might by His Spirit in the inner man. They who have already put on
        Christ as their sanctifier, are still exhorted to put Him on, ch. 13:14
        — that is, more and more. There are babes in Christ, <460301>
        Corinthians 3:1; there are little children, and young men, and fathers,
        John 2:12. Through the Spirit. — It is through the power of the Holy
        Spirit, who testifies of Christ and His salvation, and according to the
        new nature which He communicates, that the believer mortifies his sinful
        propensities.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not then of himself, of his own power or will, that he is able to
        do this. ‘Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as
        of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.’ No man overcomes the
        corruptions of his heart but by the influence of the Spirit of God.
        Though it is the Spirit of God who enables us to mortify the deeds of
        the body, yet it is also said to be our own act. We do this through the
        Spirit. The Holy Spirit works in men according to the constitution that
        God has given them. The same work is, in one point of view, the work of
        God, and in another the work of man. Ye shall live. — Here eternal life
        is promised to all who, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the
        body. The promise of life by the Gospel is not made to the work, but to
        the worker; and to the worker, not for or on account of his work, but
        according to his work, for the sake of Christ’s work. The promise, then,
        of life is not made to the work of mortification, but to him that
        mortifies his flesh; and that not for his mortification, but because he
        is in Christ, of which this mortification is the effect and the
        evidence. That they who mortify the flesh shall live, is quite
        consistent with the truth that the gift of God is eternal life, Romans
        6:23; and in this gift there is no respect to the merit of the receiver.
        This describes the character of all who shall receive eternal life; and
        it is of great importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes away every ground of hope from those who profess to know God,
        and in works deny Him; for they that are Christ’s have crucified the
        flesh with the affections and lusts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all this we are reminded that, while we cannot in this life attain to
        the fulfilling of the law in our own persons, we must seek to be
        conformed to that law, and so mortify the old man in our members,
        otherwise it is a proof that we have no part in the righteousness of
        Christ. For can it be supposed that by Him we are absolved from sin in
        order to obtain a license to continue in sin ourselves? On the contrary,
        our justification and our sanctification, as is shown in the sixth
        chapter, are inseparable. Jesus Christ came by water and blood; not by
        water only, but by water and blood, — signifying by the blood the
        expiation of the guilt of our sins by His death, and by water the virtue
        of His Spirit for our sanctification in washing our souls from the
        pollution of sin. In like manner, under the law, there were not only
        sacrifices of animals whose blood was shed, but various washings, to
        teach us that these two benefits are inseparable in the Gospel.
        Accordingly, when David describes the blessedness of the man whose
        transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered, unto whom the Lord
        imputeth not iniquity, he immediately adds, in whose spirits there is no
        guile. For ought we to wish to receive the remission of sin, and to
        continue to walk in guile? Ought we thus to seek to divide Christ,
        receiving only the efficacy of His blood and not that of His Spirit;
        desiring that He should be made to us righteousness and not also
        sanctification? We are to seek in Him the cause of our justification,
        and observe in ourselves its proofs and effects. We should see that, as
        we are pilgrims in this world, we have for our guide the Spirit of
        sanctification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
        sons of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a proof of what had just been said, namely, that if, through the
        Spirit, those whom the Apostle addressed mortified the deeds of the
        body, they should live; for all who do so are led by the Spirit. In
        spiritual things we are as little children, who, on account of their
        weakness, have need to be led by the hand that they may not fall. It is
        necessary, then, that believers be led by the Spirit of God. The manner
        in which the Spirit leads them is not by violence against their
        inclination, but by bending and changing their will, in a manner
        consistent with its nature. When Jesus Christ says, ‘No man can come to
        Me except the Father which hath sent Me, draw Him,’ it is not meant that
        God forces against their will those whom He draws, but it shows us that
        we are naturally so indisposed to go to Jesus Christ, that it is
        necessary that God, by His Spirit, draw us to Him, and that by His
        secret but powerful influence He changes our resistance into consent.
        This is what is meant by the Church in the Song of Solomon, when she
        says, ‘Draw me, we will run after Thee;’ for this shows that she is
        drawn in such a way that she runs, that is, that her will being changed,
        and her perversity removed, she with alacrity follows the Lord. God
        gives His people to will and to do of His good pleasure, making them
        willing in the day of His power, and by His Spirit changes their hearts
        of stone into hearts of flesh. This leading of the Spirit consists, too,
        in enlightening our understandings, as Jesus Christ says, ‘When He the
        Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into all truth.’ It consists
        also in the sanctification of our will and afflictions; so that he who
        is led by the Spirit is transformed by the renewing of his mind, proving
        what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. He has the
        eyes of his understanding enlightened to know what is the hope of the
        calling of God, and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the
        saints. The Apostle shows what the Spirit leads to, when he says that
        the fruit of the Spirit is ‘love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
        gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.’ It must, however, be
        remarked that this leading of the Spirit is not such in this world as to
        exclude all imperfection. For notwithstanding that we are thus led, ‘in
        many things we all offend,’ James 3:2. We have still within us a
        principle opposing the Spirit, as it is said, ‘The flesh lusteth against
        the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the
        one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would,’
        Galatians 5:17. But he is led by the Spirit, who, though enticed by the
        flesh to walk in a contrary direction, yet resists and contends against
        it, and mortifies the deeds of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit thus leads those in whom He dwells to the mortification
        of sin. He takes of the glory of the person of Jesus, as God manifest in
        the flesh, and of His office, as the one Mediator between God and man,
        and discovers it to His people. Convincing them of their sinful
        condition, and of Christ’s righteousness, He leads them to renounce
        everything of their own, in the hope of acceptance with God. He teaches
        them as the Spirit of truth shining upon His own word, striving with
        ‘them by it externally, and internally by His grace conducting, guiding,
        and bringing them onwards in the way of duty, and, as the promised
        Comforter, filling them with Divine consolation. Thus He leads them to
        Christ, to prayer as the spirit of grace and of supplication, to
        holiness, and to happiness. This shows us the cause why the children of
        God, notwithstanding their remaining ignorance and depravity, and the
        many temptations with which they are assailed, hold on in the way of the
        Lord. ‘Lead me in Thy truth, and teach me, for Thou art the God of my
        salvation; on Thee do I wait all the day.’ ‘Thy Spirit is good, lead me
        into the land of uprightness.’ This leading is enjoyed by none but
        Christians; for ‘as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
        sons of God.’ The sons of God. — The Scriptures give this character of
        sons of God differently, according as it is ascribed either by nature or
        by peace. By nature it belongs to Jesus Christ alone, and that in
        respect to His Divine nature, so that He is called the only-begotten Son
        of God. By grace there are others who are called the sons of God. The
        grace of the conception by the Holy Spirit, and of the personal union of
        the Divine nature which belongs to Jesus Christ as man, is a particular
        grace, He having been conceived by the Holy Ghost, and His human nature
        has been joined to His Divine nature, forming one person; and it is of
        this grace that the angel speaks in announcing His birth, Luke 1:35.
        There is also a grace more general, which is that of creation, by which
        the angels are called the sons of God, and from this grace those of them
        who sinned have fallen. Finally, there is the grace of redemption,
        according to which men are called, as in this place, the sons of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        As among men there are two ways of becoming children, the one by birth,
        the other by adoption, so God hath also appointed that in these two ways
        His people should become His children. Adoption supplied among men the
        want of children by birth, and no one could be a son except by one of
        these titles; but God has been pleased that we should be His sons by
        both of them together. Here and in the following verses the Apostle
        exhibits four proofs of our being the sons of God. The first is our
        being led by the Spirit of God; the second is the Spirit of adoption
        which we receive, crying, ‘Abba, Father,’ verse 15; the third is the
        witness of the Spirit with our spirits, verse 16; the fourth is our
        sufferings in the communion of Jesus Christ; to which is joined the
        fruit of our sonship, the Apostle saying that if children we are heirs
        of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him,
        that we may be also glorified together.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this title of the sons of God, the doubts and servile fears of the
        Church of Rome are condemned, which teaches that believers should be
        uncertain respecting their salvation and the love of God. But ought they
        to doubt of the love of their Heavenly Father? The Scriptures teach them
        to call God their Father, but, according to that apostate church, they
        ought to be uncertain whether they are the children of God or the
        children of the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
        This error the Apostle combats in the followings verse. The title, then,
        of sons of God is full of consolation; for we thus approach to God as
        our father, and have access with boldness to His throne of grace. Even
        in our afflictions we lift up our eyes to Him, not as a severe master,
        but a gracious Father; and we know that our afflictions are only
        chastisements and trials from His paternal love, which He employs for
        our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — For ye have not received, the spirit of bondage again to
        fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba
        Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is of the greatest importance to believers to be assured that they
        are indeed the sons of God. Without a measure of this assurance they
        cannot serve Him with love in newness of spirit. The Apostle therefore
        enlarges here on his preceding declaration, that as many as are led by
        the Spirit of God are the sons of God. In confirmation of this, he
        reminds those whom he addresses that they had not received the spirit of
        bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of adoption, leading them to call
        on God as their Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word spirit occurs twice in this verse. In this chapter, as has
        already been remarked, it is used in various senses. Sometimes it is
        taken in Scripture in a bad sense, as when it is said, Isaiah 19:14,
        ‘The Lord hath, mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof;’ and
        again, Isaiah 29:10, ‘For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit
        of deep sleep.’ In the verse before us it is taken both in a bad sense,
        signifying a sinful affection of the mind, namely, the spirit of
        bondage, and in a good sense, signifying by the Spirit of adoption the
        Holy Spirit, as in the parallel passage, Galatians 4:6, ‘And because ye
        are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,
        crying, Abba, Father.’ The spirit of bondage. — All who are not dead to
        the law, and know of no way to escape Divine wrath but by obeying it,
        must be under the spirit of bondage; serving in the oldness of the
        letter, and not in newness of spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        For so far from fulfilling the demands of the law, they fail in
        satisfying themselves. A spirit of bondage, then, must belong to all who
        are not acquainted with God’s method of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spirit of bondage is the effect of the law, which, manifesting his
        sinfulness to man, and the fearful wrath of God, makes him tremble under
        the apprehension of its curse. The Apostle, comparing the two covenants,
        namely the law from Mount Sinai, and the Gospel from Mount Zion, says
        that the one from Mount Sinai gendereth to bondage, which is Hagar, but
        Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of all believers;
        because, like Isaac, they are the children of the promise. Now this
        promise is the promise of grace. For as man has sinned, the law, which
        demands perfect obedience, and pronounces a curse against him who
        continues not in all things which it commands, must condemn and reduce
        him to the condition of a slave, who, after he transgresses, expects
        nothing but punishment. On this account, when God promulgated His law
        amidst thunderings and lightnings, the mountain trembled, and the people
        feared and stood afar off. This showed that man could only tremble under
        the law, as he could not be justified by it; but that he must have
        recourse to another covenant, namely, the covenant of grace, in which
        God manifests His mercy and His love, in which He presents to sinners
        the remission of their sins, and the righteousness of His well beloved
        Son; for in this covenant He justifies the ungodly, Romans 4:5, and
        imputes to them righteousness without works. He adopts as His own
        children those who were formerly children of wrath, and gives the Spirit
        of adoption to them who had before a spirit of bondage and servile fear.
        Again to fear. — Paul uses the word again to indicate a double
        opposition, — the one of the state of a man before and after his
        regeneration, the other of the New Testament and the Old. Before
        regeneration, a man, sensible that he is a sinner, must be apprehensive
        of punishment, not having embraced the only remedy provided for the
        remission of his sins by Jesus Christ. Not that it should be supposed
        that this is the case with all unregenerate men, or at all times, but
        only when their consciences are awakened, summoning them before the
        judgment-seat of God. For the greater part of them live in profane
        security, with hardened consciences, and without any apprehension of
        their ruined state. God, however, often impresses that fear on those
        whom He purposes to lead to the knowledge of His salvation. But when
        they are born of the Spirit, this servile fear gives place to a filial
        fear which proceeds from love, as the proper effect of the Spirit of
        adoption. ‘Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
        the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear; because
        fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The other opposition which the Apostle marks in saying again, is between
        the Churches of the Old and of the New Testament. Not that the believers
        under the Old Testament had not the Spirit of adoption; for they were
        sanctified by the Spirit of God, and had fellowship with Jesus Christ
        the promised Messiah, being justified by faith, as is declared in the
        eleventh chapter of the Hebrews, and called God their Father, Isaiah
        63:16. But the Church under the Old Testament, being still in its
        infancy, did not enjoy the Spirit of adoption in that abundance, nor had
        it so clear a revelation of grace, as that of the New. Believers only
        saw Christ at a distance under shadows and figures, while the law and
        its curses were strongly exhibited. Thus, in comparison of the New
        Testament and its freedom, they were, in a measure, held under bondage,
        Galatians 4:1-3.
      </p>
      <p>
        The believers at Rome, then, whether originally Jews or Gentiles, had
        not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. They were not come
        unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, or to
        the law, the work of which is written in the hearts of all men, which
        speaks nothing of mercy; but they were come to Mount Zion. It was the
        design of Christ’s advent that believers in Him might serve God ‘without
        fear,’ Luke 1:74.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ came that through death He might destroy death, and him
        that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and to deliver them
        who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage,
        Hebrews 2:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the movements excited by the spirit of bondage are only those of a
        slave, — selfish and mercenary motives of desire, hope of what will give
        them happiness, and fear of evil, but no movement of love either of God
        or holiness, or of hatred of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage before us, and many others, as that of 2 Timothy 1:7, — ’God
        hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of
        a sound mind,’ — teaches us that servile fear ought to be banished from
        the minds of believers. This fear is a fear of distrust, and not that
        fear to which we are enjoined in various parts of Scripture, namely, a
        reverential fear of God impressed by a sense of His majesty, which is
        the beginning of wisdom, and which His children should at all times
        cherish. This fear is connected with the consolations of the Holy Ghost.
        ‘Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and
        Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in
        the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.’ There is also a
        salutary fear which ought always to be maintained in the hearts of
        Christians; for the assurance of his salvation, which a believer ought
        to cherish, is not a profane assurance which prompts him to disregard
        the authority of God, but leads to a diligent carefulness to conform to
        His word, and make use of the means for edification of His appointment.
        This is what the Apostle intends when he says, ‘Work out your own
        salvation with fear and trembling;’ for God designs to banish from our
        hearts a carnal security, as appears when it is added, ‘for it is God
        which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure,’
        showing that it is God who produces in His people both the will and the
        performance. This fear is required from the consideration of our
        weakness, our propensity to evil, and the many spiritual enemies with
        whom we are surrounded; and for the purpose of making us careful that we
        do not fall; while we ought not to doubt of the love of our Heavenly
        Father, but, considering the infallible promises of our God, and the
        intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ, we should hold fast the assurance
        of our salvation. The Apostle Peter enjoins on those whom he addressed
        as elect unto obedience, through the foreknowledge of God, as loving
        Jesus Christ, and as rejoicing in Him with joy unspeakable and full of
        glory, to pass the time of their sojourning here in fear, because they
        had been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ. This consideration
        shows how horrible and dangerous is the nature of sin which works in our
        members. This fear implanted in the hearts of the children of God tends
        to their preservation in the midst of dangers, as that instinctive fear
        which exists in all men operates to the preservation of natural life,
        and is entirely consistent with the fullest confidence in God, with
        love, and the joyful hope of eternal glory. If, however, the fear of
        man, or of any evil from the world, deter believers from doing their
        duty to God, it arises from the remains of carnal and unmortified fear.
        But nothing is more unworthy of the Gospel, or more contrary to its
        spirit, which, in proportion as it is believed, begets love, and
        communicates joy, peace, and consolation, in every situation in which we
        are placed. But ye have received the Spirit of adoption. — The Holy
        Spirit is called the Spirit of adoption, either as the cause by which
        God makes us His children, or as the earnest and seal of our adoption.
        Contrary to the spirit of bondage, the Spirit of adoption produces in
        the heart a sense of reconciliation with God, love to Him, a regard to
        holiness, hatred of sin, and peace of conscience through the knowledge
        of the love of God in Jesus Christ. It begets a desire to glorify God
        here on earth, and to enjoy the glory of heaven hereafter. Formerly, in
        their unregenerate state, those to whom Paul wrote had the spirit of
        slaves, now they had the spirit of sons. Adoption is not a work of grace
        in us, but an act of God’s grace without us.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the original word, it signifies putting among children. It
        is taking those who were by nature children of wrath from the family of
        Satan, to which they originally belonged, into the family of God. By
        union with Jesus Christ, being joined with Him, we are one body, and we
        enter into the communion of His righteousness, and of His title as the
        Son of God, so that, as we are righteous in Him, we are also in Him, as
        His members, the sons of God, who, in the moment that the Holy Spirit
        unites us to Jesus Christ, receives us as His children. All this shows
        us how great is the benefit which we obtain when we receive the Spirit
        of adoption and communion with the Son of God. We are thus made children
        of God, the sons of the Father of lights — a title permanent, and a
        nature immortal and Divine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our adoption reminds us of our original state as children of wrath and
        rebellion, and strangers to the covenant of God. It discovers to us the
        honor to which God has called us, in becoming our Father and making us
        His children, — including so many advantages, rights, and privileges,
        and at the same time imposing on us so many duties. These may be
        comprised under four heads. The first regards the privilege and glory of
        having God for our Father, and being His children. The second includes
        the rights which this adoption confers, as of free access to God, the
        knowledge of His ways, and the assurance of His protection. The third
        implies God’s love for us, His jealousy for our interest, and His care
        to defend us. The fourth, all the duties which the title or relation of
        children engages us to perform towards our Father and our God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term adoption is borrowed from the ancient custom, especially
        prevalent among the Romans, of a man who had no children of his own
        adopting into his family the child of another. The father and the
        adopted child appeared before the praetor, when the adopting father said
        to the child, Wilt thou be my son ? and the child answered, I will. The
        allusion to this custom reminds believers that they are not the children
        of God otherwise than by His free and voluntary election, and that thus
        they are under far more powerful obligations to serve Him than are their
        own children to obey them, since it is entirely by His love and free
        good pleasure that they have been elevated to this dignity. We should
        also remark the difference between the adoption of man and the adoption
        of God. In choosing a son by adoption, the adopting party has regard to
        certain real or supposed qualities which appear meritorious or
        agreeable; but God, in adopting His people, Himself produces the
        qualities in those whom He thus chooses. Man can impart his goods and
        give his name to those whom he adopts, but he cannot change their
        descent, nor transfer them into his own image; but God renders those
        whom He adopts not only partakers of His name and of His blessings, but
        of His nature itself, charging and transforming them into His own
        blessed resemblance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This adoption, then, is accompanied with a real change, and so great a
        change, that it bears the name of that which is the real ground of
        sonship, and is called regeneration. And these are inseparable. There
        are no sons of God by adoption, but such as are also His sons by
        regeneration. There is a new life breathed into them by God. He is not
        only the Father of their spirits by their first infusion into the body,
        enlivening it by them, but by this new infusion of grace into their
        souls, which were dead without it; and the Spirit of God renewing them
        is the Spirit of adoption, by which they cry, ‘Abba, Father.’ He gives
        them a supernatural life by His Spirit sent into their hearts; and the
        Spirit by that regeneration which He works, ascertains to them that
        adoption which is in Christ Jesus; and in the persuasion of both they
        call God their Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this manner, after adoption comes our sonship by regeneration, not in
        the order of time, but of nature; for, being united to Christ, God forms
        in us His image, and this is the second way in which we are made the
        children of God. Regeneration, or this new birth, is not a figurative
        but a real change. ‘If any man be in Christ he is a new creature,’ or a
        new creation, 2 Corinthians 5:17; for when we are regenerated, we are
        created in Christ Jesus, Ephesians 2:10. Nor is it a reformation of
        character, but the renewal of the image of God in the soul, which had
        been totally effaced. They who are born again, are begotten in Christ
        Jesus through the Gospel, being born not of corruptible seed, but of
        incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
        Thus they are ‘born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
        the will of man, but of God.’ For this new birth the man can do nothing
        to prepare himself. Neither after he is renewed can he effect anything
        to ensure his perseverance in his new state. The Spirit of God alone
        both renews and preserves those who are renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this regeneration we obtain qualities which are analogous to the
        nature of God. He enlightens our understanding, sanctifies our will,
        purifies our affections, and, by the communication of those qualities
        which have a relation to His Divine nature, begets us in His image and
        likeness, which is the new man of which Paul speaks, Ephesians 4:23,24;
        Colossians 3:10; and, as the Apostle Peter declares, we are made
        ‘partakers of the Divine nature.’ The fall of Adam has not deprived man
        of his subsistence or of his faculties, but has introduced into his
        understanding the darkness of ignorance, with malice and evil into his
        will, and disorder in his affections; so that, before his adoption and
        regeneration, he is by these vicious qualities the child of Satan, whose
        image he bears. The opposite of all this is that spiritual regeneration
        by means of which he is the child of God, consisting in the
        re-establishment of the uprightness of his faculties, and the abolition
        of those vicious qualities which have been introduced by sin. God begets
        us by His Spirit and by His word, James 1:18; and on His sons, thus
        formed, He bestows two graces, — the one is their justification, and the
        other their sanctification. By the first, they are invested with the
        righteousness of Jesus Christ, which is imputed to them; and this is the
        principal part of their spiritual and supernatural life, which is hid in
        Jesus Christ, Colossians 3:3. By the second, the Holy Spirit operates in
        them, to quicken and make them walk in newness of life. And as this last
        grace is not perfect in this world, but still leaves many faults and
        imperfections, although they are the children of God, there are still in
        them remains of the old man, and of the image of Satan. In this sense
        they have more or less the character of children of God, as they advance
        more or less in sanctification; and to this advancement they are
        continually urged by the exhortations of the word of God. The adoption
        of God’s people, and their regeneration, are both declared, John
        1:12,13.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adoption confers the name of sons, and a title to the inheritance;
        regeneration confers the nature of sons, and a meetness for the
        inheritance. Abba, Father. — The interpretation which is generally given
        of this expression is, that Paul employs these two words — Syriac and
        Greek, the one taken from the language in use among the Jews, the other
        from that of the Gentiles — to show that there is no longer any
        distinction between the Jew and the Greek, and that all believers, in
        every nation, may address God as their Father in their own language. It
        would rather appear that the Apostle alludes to the fact that among the
        Jews slaves were not allowed to call a free man Abba, which signified a
        real father. ‘I cannot help remarking’ (says Claude in his Essay on the
        Composition of a Sermon) ‘the ignorance of Messieurs of Port-Royal, who
        have translated this passage, My Father, instead of Abba, Father, under
        pretense that the Syriac word Abba signifies Father. They did not know
        that St. Paul alluded to a law among the Jews which forbade slaves to
        call a free man Abba, or a free woman Imma. The Apostle meant that we
        were no more slaves, but freed by Jesus Christ; and consequently that we
        might call God Abba, as we call the Church Imma. In translating the
        passage, then, the word Abba, although it be a Syriac word, and unknown
        in our tongue, must always be preserved, for in this term consists the
        force of the Apostle’s reasoning.’
      </p>
      <p>
        God is indeed our Father, as the Author of our being, beyond all visible
        creatures, as it is said, ‘We are also His offspring,’ Acts 17:28. But
        the privilege of this our natural relation, the sin of our nature hath
        made fruitless to us, till we be restored by grace, and made partakers
        of a new sonship. We are indeed the workmanship of God; but, it being
        defaced by sin, our true name, as considered in that state, is ‘children
        of wrath.’ But the sonship that emboldens us to draw near unto God as
        our Father is derived from His only-begotten Son. He became the Son of
        man to make us anew the sons of God. Being thus restored, we may indeed
        look back upon; our creation, and remember in prayer that we are His
        creatures, the workmanship of His hands, and He in that sense our
        Father; but by reason of our rebellion this argument is not strong
        enough alone, but must be supported with this other, as the main ground
        of our comfort, and that wherein the strength of our confidence lies,
        that He is our Father in His Son Jesus Christ; that by faith we are
        introduced into a new sonship, and by virtue of that may call Him
        Father, and move Him by that name to help and answer us. ‘To as many as
        received Him, He gave power to become the sons of God,’ John 1:12. But
        adoption holds in Jesus Christ, as the Head of this fraternity;
        therefore He says, ‘I go to My Father, and your Father; to holy God, and
        your God.’ He does not say, ‘to our Father and our God,’ but severally
        mine and yours; teaching us the order of the new covenant, that the
        sonship of Jesus Christ is not only more eminent in nature, but in order
        is the spring and cause of ours. So, then, He that puts this word in our
        mouths, to call God ‘Father,’ He it is by whom we have this dignity and
        comfort that we call Him so. Whereby we cry. — The Spirit of adoption,
        which, enabling those who receive this Spirit to address God as their
        Father, gives filial dispositions and filial confidence. ‘Because ye are
        sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,
        crying, Abba, Father,’ Galatians 4:6. It is by the Spirit of God that we
        cry unto Him, according to what is said afterwards, that the Spirit
        ‘helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we
        ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings
        which cannot be uttered.’ This teaches us that it is not our own
        disposition that excites us to prayer, but the Spirit of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly we are commanded to pray ‘always with all prayer and
        supplication in the Spirit,’ Ephesians 6:18; and to build up ‘ourselves
        on our most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,’ Jude 20. He is
        called ‘the Spirit of grace and of supplications,’ Zechariah 12:10, to
        teach us that prayer, being His work, and not an effort of our own
        strength, we are to ask of God His Spirit to enable us to pray. This is
        the source of our consolation, that since our prayers are effects of His
        own Spirit within us, they are pleasing to God. ‘He that searcheth the
        hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because He maketh
        intercession for the saints according to the will of God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit, as the Spirit of adoption, also influences the prayers
        of believers as to their manner and earnestness, for by Him they not
        only say, but cry, ‘Abba, Father.’ They not only speak, but groan, for
        they cry not so much with the mouth as with the heart. By the term ‘we
        cry’ is also intimated the assurance of faith with which we ought to
        draw near to God. This expression signifies that we address God with
        earnestness and confidence; and that, having full reliance on His
        promises, which He hath confirmed even with an oath, we should ‘come
        boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
        grace to help in time of need.’
      </p>
      <p>
        We are also commanded to ask in faith, nothing wavering, for we come
        before the throne of God by His beloved Son. We appear as His members,
        in virtue of His blood, by which our sins, which would hinder our
        prayers from being heard, are expiated, so that God has no more
        remembrance of them. It is on this ground that we pray with assurance,
        for, as we cannot pray to God as our Father, but by His Son, so we
        cannot cry, ‘Abba, Father,’ but by Him; and on this account Jesus says,
        ‘I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the
        Father but by Me.’ Thus the consideration that we invoke God as our
        Father forms in believers a holy assurance, for, as a father pitieth his
        children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him. Since, then, we call
        God our Father, as our Lord teaches us to address Him, we should do it
        with the assurance of His love, and of His readiness to hear us. ‘Thou
        shalt call Me, My Father; and shalt not turn away from Me,’ Jeremiah
        3:19.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word Father also indicates the substance of our prayers; for when we
        can say no more to God than ‘O God, Thou art our Father,’ we say all,
        and comprehend in this all that we can ask; as the Church said in its
        captivity, ‘Doubtless Thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of
        us.’ Thus, in whatever situation the believer finds himself, the crying,
        ‘Abba, Father,’ contains an appeal sufficient to move the compassion of
        God. Is he in want? he says, ‘Abba, Father,’ as if he said, ‘O Lord,
        Thou feedest the ravens, provide for Thy son.’ Is he in danger? it is as
        if he said, ‘Have the same care of me as a father has for his child, and
        let not Thy compassion and Thy providence abandon me.’ Is he on the bed
        of death? it is as if he said, ‘Since thou art my Father, into Thy hands
        I commend my spirit.’ All acceptable prayer must proceed from the Spirit
        of adoption; and the cry of the Spirit of adoption is no other than
        Ababa, Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crying ‘Abba, Father,’ then, denotes the earnestness and importunity
        in prayer to God, which is the effect of the Spirit of adoption in the
        hearts of the children of God, as well as that holy familiarity, to the
        exercise of which, as viewing God sitting on a throne of grace, they are
        encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        They call upon God as their Father, after the example of our Lord, who
        at all times addressed God in this manner during His ministry on earth,
        with that one memorable exception, when, under the pressure of the sins
        of His people, and the withdrawing of the light of His countenance, He
        addressed Him not as His Father but His God, Matthew 27:46. After His
        resurrection, in like manner, He comforted His disciples with the
        consolatory assurance that He was about to ascend to His Father and
        their Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The different expressions which the Scriptures employ to denote the
        filial relation of His people to God, are calculated to aid their
        conceptions, and to elevate their thoughts to that great and ineffable
        blessing. One mode of expression serves to supply what is wanting in
        another. The origin of the spiritual life, and the re-establishment of
        the image of God in the soul, are expressed by these words — born of
        God. But that they may not forget the state of their natural alienation
        from God, and ill order to indicate their title to the heavenly
        inheritance, it is said that they are adopted by God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lest they should suppose that this adoption is to be attributed to
        anything meritorious in them, they are informed that God has
        predestinated them unto the adoption of children, by Jesus Christ, to
        Himself, accordingly to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of
        the glory of His grave, Ephesians 1:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage before us is conclusive against the doctrine of the Church
        of Rome, which maintains that the believer ought to be always in fear of
        condemnation, always in doubt of the love of God, and of his salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But is not this expressly to contradict the words of the Apostle? It
        should be remarked that they cannot plead here the exception that it was
        a prerogative peculiar to the Apostle, to be assured of his salvation,
        by a special revelation that had been made to him. For he speaks
        expressly to believers, ‘Ye have received the Spirit of adoption,’ and
        next he speaks of them with himself, when he says, ‘whereby we cry,
        Abba, Father.’ This assurance of the believer is clearly taught in many
        other places. The Apostle, after saying, Romans 5:1, ‘Being justified by
        faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ,’ adds, ‘By
        whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and
        rejoice in hope of the glory of God,’ — expressing by the word rejoice
        (literally boast) a full assurance; for it would be rashness to boast or
        glory (as the same word is translated in the following verse) in what
        was not a real certainty. He also declares that hope maketh not ashamed;
        and that we even glory in tribulations, as assured that they cannot
        deprive us of the love of God. ‘We have boldness, too, and access with
        confidence,’ by the faith we have in Jesus Christ, Ephesians 3:12. ‘Let
        us, therefore’ (seeing that we have a great High Priest, that is passed
        into the heavens), ‘come boldly unto the throne of grace,’ Hebrews
        4:14-16. And why is the Spirit which is given to believers called the
        seal and earnest of their inheritance, if it is not to give them this
        assurance? Why, also, are the declarations so express, that there is no
        condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, and that whosoever
        believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life? The Apostle
        John says, ‘These things have I written unto you that believe on the
        name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life,’ —
        thus showing that he desires that all who believe should know that they
        have eternal life. The reply of the Roman Catholics, that we cannot know
        assuredly if we have faith, is altogether vain. Paul proves the
        contrary, when he says, ‘Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith;
        prove your own selves; know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ
        is in you, except ye be reprobates?’ 2 Corinthians 13:5. This proves
        that believers may recognize their own faith. Faith combats doubts, as
        the Apostle James shows when he says, ‘Let him ask in faith, nothing
        wavering; for he that watereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the
        wind and tossed.’
      </p>
      <p>
        And speaking of Abraham, Paul says, ‘He staggered not at the promise of
        God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Believing, then, His promises, and drawing near in the full assurance of
        faith, gives glory to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        But doe’s faith, then, exclude all uncertainty of salvation, and has the
        believer no misgivings after he has received the Spirit of adoption? It
        is replied, that as faith is more or less perfect, there is more or less
        uncertainty or doubt connected with it, for doubts are owing to the
        weakness or to the want of faith. Faith, as viewed in itself, is one
        thing, and another as viewed in an imperfect subject. Faith in itself
        excludes all doubts and misgivings; but, because our sanctification is
        incomplete in this world, and as there is always in us the remains of
        the old man and of the flesh, which is the source of doubts, faith has
        always to combat within us, and to resist the servile fear of distrust,
        arising from the remains of our corruption. The believer, therefore,
        need not wonder though he should sometimes find himself agitated and
        troubled with doubts; on which account he should, indeed, be humbled,
        but not discouraged, for in the end faith will again raise up itself
        from under the burden of temptation, and comfort him. The Spirit of
        adoption is sometimes as if it was extinguished in us; but in the end it
        exerts its force in our hearts, so that we cry, ‘Abba, Father,’ and say
        with David, ‘Make me to have joy and gladness, that the bones which Thou
        hast broken may rejoice.’ The language of the Spirit of adoption is,
        ‘Lord, Thou art my Father, make the light of Thy countenance to shine
        upon me; cause Thy peace to reign in my conscience; expel all doubts,
        scatter the clouds which prevent me from seeing clearly the light of Thy
        face, and which hinder the Sun of Righteousness from shining in my
        heart.’ ‘Say Thou to my soul, I am Thy salvation,’ Psalm 35:3. ‘O my
        soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord,’ Psalm 16:2. And
        God says, Hosea 2:23, ‘I will say to them which were not My people, Thou
        art My people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.’ That is, ‘I will
        speak within the believer by My Spirit; I will assure him of My grace,
        and of My love; and he also shall lift up his heart to Me, and call Me
        his Father and his God.’ All this teaches us that the conscience,
        sprinkled with the blood of the Son of God, does not accuse or condemn,
        but consoles and comforts; for we have, by means of the Spirit that is
        given us, the earnest of our final deliverance. This proves how precious
        the promise of the Spirit should be to us, in order that we may not
        grieve Him by giving way to sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
        are the children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse it is said, ‘Ye have received the Spirit of
        adoption;’ here it is added, ‘The Spirit itself’ — the same Spirit —
        ’beareth witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God.’ In this
        verse the Apostle shows that the sons of God may be assured of their
        adoption, because it is witnessed by the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit,
        in the heart of a believer, joins His testimony with his spirit, in
        confirmation of this truth, that he is a son of God. It is not merely
        the fruits of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers which afford
        this testimony, but the Spirit Himself, by imparting filial confidence,
        inspires it in the heart. This is a testimony which is designed for the
        satisfaction of believers themselves, and cannot be submitted to the
        scrutiny of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The witnesses here spoken of are two, — our spirit, and the Spirit of
        God together with our spirit. We have the testimony of our spirit when
        we are convinced of our sinfulness, misery, and ruin, and of our utter
        inability to relieve ourselves from the curse of the broken law, and are
        at the same time convinced of the righteousness of Christ, and of our
        dependence upon Him for acceptance with God. We have this testimony when
        we possess the consciousness of cordially acquiescing in God’s plan of
        salvation, and of putting our trust in Christ; and when we are convinced
        that His blood is sufficient to cleanse us from all sin, and know that
        we are willing to rest on it; and when in this way, and in this way
        alone, we draw near to gods with a true heart, sprinkled from an evil
        conscience in the discernment of the efficacy of His atonement, thus
        having the answer of a good conscience towards God. And we have the
        above testimony confirmed to us when we experience and observe the
        effects of the renovation of our souls in the work of sanctification
        begun and carrying on in us; and that not with fleshly wisdom, but by
        the grace of God, we have our conversation in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all this the Holy Spirit enables us to ascertain our sonship, from
        being conscious of, and discovering in ourselves, the true marks of a
        renewed state. But to say that this is all that is signified by the Holy
        Spirits testimony, would be falling short of what is affirmed in this
        text; for in that case the Holy Spirit would only help the conscience to
        be a witness, but could not be said to be a witness Himself, even
        another witness besides the conscience, which the text asserts. What we
        learn, therefore, from it is, that the Holy Spirit testifies to our
        spirit in a distinct and immediate testimony, and also with our spirit
        in a concurrent testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
        This testimony, although it cannot be explained, is nevertheless felt by
        the believer; it is felt by him, too, in its variations, as sometimes
        stronger and more palpable, and at other times more feeble and less
        discernible. As the heart knoweth its own bitterness, in like manner a
        stranger intermeddles not with the joy communicated by this secret
        testimony to our spirit. Its reality is indicated in Scripture by such
        expressions as those of the Father and the Son coming unto us, and
        making their abode with us, — Christ manifesting Himself to us, and
        stepping with us, — His giving us the hidden manna, and the white stone,
        denoting the communication to us of the knowledge of an acquittal from
        guilt, and a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
        receiveth it. ‘The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
        Ghost, which is given unto us.’ ‘He that believeth on the Son of God
        hath the witness in himself,’ 1 John 5:10.
      </p>
      <p>
        This witnessing of the Spirit to the believer’s spirit, communicating
        consolation, is never His first work, but is consequent on His other
        work of renovation. He first gives faith, and then seals. ‘After that ye
        believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.’ He also
        witnesseth with our spirit, graciously shining on His own promises,
        making them clear, assuring us of their truth, enabling our spirit to
        embrace them and to discover our interest in them. He witnesseth with
        our spirit in all the blessedness of. His gracious fruits, diffusing
        through the soul love, and joy, and peace. In the first method of His
        witnessing with our spirit we are passive; but in the last method there
        is a concurrence on our part with His testimony. The testimony of the
        Spirit, then, is attended with the testimony of conscience, and is thus
        a co-witness with our spirit. It may also be observed, that where this
        exists, it brings with it a disposition and promptitude for prayer. It
        is the testimony of the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, ‘Abba,
        Father;’ it disposes the soul to holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important truth here affirmed, that the Holy Spirit beareth witness
        with our spirit, does not seduce believers from the written word, or
        expose them to delusions, mistaken for internal revelations, differing
        from the revelations of Scripture. This internal revelation must be
        agreeable to Scripture revelation, and is no revelation of a new article
        of faith unknown to Scripture. It is the revelation of a truth consonant
        to the word of God, and made to a believer in that blessed book for his
        comfort. The Spirit testifies to our sonship by an external revelation
        in the Scriptures that believers are the sons of God. He concurs with
        this testimony by illuminating the mind and understanding, and
        persuading it of the truth of this external revelation. He unites with
        this testimony by reason of His gracious sanctifying presence in us, and
        is therefore called the earnest of our inheritance, and God’s seal,
        marking us as His own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs
        with Christ: if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also,
        glorified together.
      </p>
      <p>
        If children, then heirs. — The Apostle, having proved the adoption of
        believers from the confirmation of the double and concurrent testimony
        of their own spirit and of the Spirit of God, here infers from it the
        certainty of their possessing the eternal inheritance. The fact of their
        being heirs he deduces from their being children. In this world children
        are, in all nations, heirs of their parents’ possessions. This is the
        law of nature. As such, it not only illustrates but confirms the fact
        that believers are heirs as being children. By the declaration that they
        are heirs, we are reminded that it is not by purchase, or by any work of
        their own, that they obtain the inheritance to which they are
        predestinated, Ephesians 1:11, and begotten, 1 Peter 1:3. It is solely
        in virtue of their sonship. The inheritance, which is a kingdom, was
        provided for them from the foundation of the world, Matthew 25:34,
        before they existed; and as inheritances were under the law inalienable,
        so this inheritance is eternal.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are heirs according to the promise, Galatians 3:29; heirs of
        promise, Hebrews 6:17, — that is, of all the blessings contained in the
        promise of God, which He confirmed by an oath; heirs of salvation,
        Hebrews 1:14; heirs of the grace of life, 1 Peter 3:7; heirs according
        to the hope of eternal life, Titus 3:7; heirs of righteousness, Hebrews
        11:7; heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised, James 2:5. All
        things are theirs: for they are Christ’s and Christ is God’s,
        Corinthians 3:23. Heirs of God. — Here, in one word, the Apostle states
        what is the inheritance of those who are the children of God. It is God
        Himself. ‘If a son, then an heir of God through Christ,’ Galatians 4:7.
        This expression, ‘heirs of God,’ has a manifest relation to the title of
        ‘son,’ which is acquired by adoption, on which account the Apostle here
        joins them together. This teaches that believers have not only a right
        to the good things of God, but that they have this right by their
        adoption, and not by merit. As the birthright of a child confers a title
        to the property of its father, and so distinguishes such property from
        what the child may acquire by industry and labor, so also is the case
        with adoption. Here we see the difference between the law and the
        Gospel. The law treats men as mercenaries, and says, Do, and live; the
        Gospel treats them as children, and says, Live, and do. God is the
        portion of His people; and in Him, who is ‘the possessor of heaven and’
        earth, they are heirs of all things. ‘He that overcometh shall inherit
        all things: and I will be his God, and he shall be My son,’ Revelation
        21:7. God is all sufficient; and this is an all-sufficient inheritance.
        God is eternal and unchangeable; and therefore it is an eternal
        inheritance, — an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth
        not away. They cannot be dispossessed of it, for the omnipotence of God
        secures against all opposition. It is reserved for them in heaven, which
        is the throne of God, and where He manifests His glory. It is God
        Himself, then, who is the inheritance of His children. This shows that
        He communicates Himself to them by His grace, His light, His holiness,
        His life. They possess God as their inheritance in two degrees, namely,
        in possessing in this life His grace, and in the life to come His glory.
        ‘Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me to
        glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I
        desire besides Thee!’ Psalm 73:24. And what is the inheritance in glory,
        if it be not God, who is all in all! Here we have the life of grace,
        ‘The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
        communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.’ In the life to come, it
        is the enjoyment or the vision of God which, in the seventeenth Psalm,
        the Prophet opposes to the inheritance of the men of this world, —
        ’Deliver me, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in
        this life. As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall
        be satisfied when I awake with Thy likeness.’ Into this inheritance
        Moses — that is to say, the law — cannot introduce us. He alone can do
        it who is the great Joshua — Jesus Christ, the Mediator of a better
        covenant. Joint heirs with Christ. — This, with the expression ‘heirs of
        God,’ shows the glorious nature of the inheritance of the children of
        God. What must this honor be when they are heirs of God, and joint heirs
        with Christ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam was a son of God; the lordship of paradise was given him, but he
        lost it. Satan and his angels were also sons of God by creation, and
        they fell. But the joint heirs of Christ can never fall. They have their
        inheritance secured by their union with Christ, and hold it by a title
        which is indefeasible, and a right which never can be revoked. Christ is
        the heir, as being the Son of God. All things that the Father hath are
        His; and, as Mediator, He is appointed ‘heir of all things,’ and they
        are joint heirs with Him. The inheritance to be possessed by them is the
        same in its nature as that possessed by the man Christ Jesus; and the
        glory that the Father gives to Him, He gives to them, John 18:22. They
        participate of the same Spirit with Him; for they that have not the
        Spirit of Christ are none of His. That same life that He has is
        conferred on them; and because He lives, they live also. He is the
        fountain of their life, Psalm 36:9. The glory of their bodies will be of
        the same kind with His, Philippians 3:21. The glory that the Father gave
        to Him, He has given to them, John 17:22.
      </p>
      <p>
        They shall be admitted to the same glorious place with Him, and shall
        behold His glory, John 17:24. There must be a conformity between the
        head and the members, but as to the degree, He who is the first-born
        among many brethren must in all things have the pre-eminence. If so be
        that ye suffer with Him. — The Apostle had shown that believers are the
        adopted children of God, heirs of ‘God, and joint heirs with Jesus
        Christ. He now refers to a possible objection, namely, that
        notwithstanding this they are often full of trouble and afflictions in
        this life, which appears not to be suitable to so near a relationship
        with God.
      </p>
      <p>
        This he obviates by reminding them that they suffer with Christ, and
        that their sufferings, which result from their bearing them with Him,
        will issue in future glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sufferings of Jesus Christ are to be regarded in two points of view.
        On the one hand, He suffered as the propitiation for the sins of His
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, His sufferings are to be viewed as the road
        conducting Him to glory. In the first of these His people have no part;
        He alone was the sacrifice offered for their salvation; He alone made
        satisfaction to the justice of God; and He alone merited the reward for
        them. But in the second point of view, He is the pattern of their
        condition; in this they must follow His steps, and be made conformable
        to Him. Suffering, then, is a peculiarity in the earthly lot of all the
        heirs of heaven; they are all called to suffer with Christ. The man
        professing Christ’s religion, who meets with no persecution or
        opposition from the world for Christ’s sake, may well doubt the
        sincerity of his profession. ‘All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
        shall suffer persecution.’ All the heirs will come to the enjoyment of
        their inheritance through tribulation; most of them through much
        tribulation. But so far from this being an argument against the sure
        prospect of that inheritance, it tends to confirm it. The expression ‘if
        so be,’ or since, does not intimate that this is doubtful, but
        establishes its certainty. God causes His children to suffer in
        different ways, and for different reasons, for their good, as for the
        trial of their faith, the exercise of patience, the mortification of
        sin, and in order to wean them from this world and prepare them for
        heaven. Their sufferings are effects of His Fatherly love; and the great
        object of them is, that they may be conformed to Christ. Sufferings are
        appointed for them in order that they should not be condemned with the
        world, and, to work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight
        of glory. That we may be also glorified together. — This ought to
        support Christians under their sufferings. What a consolation in the
        midst of afflictions for Christ’s sake, that they shall also be
        glorified together with Him! In His sufferings He is set forth as their
        pattern, and the issue of them is their encouragement. They have the
        honor of suffering with Him, and they shall have the honor of being
        glorified with Him. They not only accompany him in His sufferings, but
        He also accompanies them in theirs; not only to sympathize with them,
        but to be their surety and defender.
      </p>
      <p>
        This community in suffering with Jesus Christ is sufficient to impart to
        His people the highest consolation. What an honor is it to bear, here
        below, His cross, on the way to where one day they shall have a place
        upon His throne! Having the same enemies with Him, they must have the
        some combats, the same victories, and the same triumphs. Since the Lord
        has been pleased to suffer for them before reigning over them in heaven,
        it is proper that they should suffer also for His sake and in the
        prospect of reigning with Him. For suffering with Him, they shall
        overcome with Him; and overcoming with Him, they shall obtain the crown
        of life and eternal glory.
