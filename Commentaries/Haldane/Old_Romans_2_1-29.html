      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 2:1-29</p>
      <p>
        IN the preceding chapter, the Apostle had described the state of the
        idolatrous Pagans, whom he had proved to be under the just condemnation
        of God. He now passes to that of the Jews, who, while they rejected the
        righteousness of God, to which the law and the prophets bore witness,
        looked for salvation from their relation to Abraham, from their
        exclusive privileges as a nation, and from their observance of the law.
        In this and the two following chapters, Paul combats these deeply-rooted
        prejudices, and is thus furnished with an opportunity of clearly
        unfolding the doctrine of the Gospel, and of proving that it alone is
        the power of God unto salvation. In the first part of this chapter, to
        the 24th verse he shows that the just judgment of God must be the same
        against the Jews as against the Gentiles, since the Jews are equally
        sinners. In the second part, from the beginning of the 25th verse to the
        end, he proves that the external advantages which the Jews had enjoyed,
        were insufficient to ward off this judgment. From his language at the
        commencement of this chapter, in respect to that judgment which the Jews
        were accustomed to pass on the other nations, and to which he reverts in
        the 17th verse, it is evident that through the whole of it he is
        addressing the Jews, and not referring, as many suppose, to the heathen
        philosophers or magistrates It was not the Apostle’s object to convince
        them in particular that they were sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, neither the philosophers nor magistrates, nor any of the
        heathens, occupied themselves in judging others respecting their
        religious worship and ceremonies. Such observances, as well as their
        moral effects on those by whom they were practiced, appeared to the
        sages of Greece and Rome a matter of perfect indifference. The Jews, on
        the contrary, had learned from their law, to judge, to condemn, and to
        abhor all other religions; to keep themselves at the greatest distance
        from those who profess them; and to regard all idolaters as under the
        wrath of God. The man, then, who judges others — to whom, by a figure of
        speech, Paul addresses his discourse in the first verse — is the same to
        whom he continues to speak in the rest of the chapter, and whom he names
        in the 17th verse, ‘Behold, thou art called a Jew.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
        judges: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for
        thou that judgest doest the same things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore. — This particle introduces a conclusion, not from anything in
        the preceding chapter, but to establish a truth from what follows. The
        Apostle had proved the guilt of the Gentiles, who, since they had a
        revelation vouchsafed to them in the works of God, though they did not
        possess His word, were inexcusable. The Jews, who had His word, yet
        practiced the same things for which the former were condemned, must
        therefore also be inexcusable. In the sequel, he specifies and unfolds
        the charge thus generally preferred. O Man. — This is a manner of
        address betokening his earnestness, which Paul frequently employs, as in
        the ninth chapter of this Epistle. Whosoever thou art that judgest. —
        The Apostle here refers to the judgment which the Jews passed on the
        Gentiles. It is generally explained as if he was finding fault with
        those whom he addressed, and declaring they were inexcusable, because
        they judged others. But this is erroneous.
      </p>
      <p>
        What he censures, is not their judging, but their doing the same things
        with those whom they condemned. The character of the Jews, which
        distinguished them from the Gentiles, was that they judged others. God
        had conferred on them this distinction, when He manifested His covenant
        to them, to the exclusion of all the other nations of the world. This
        character of judging, then, can belong only to the Jews, who, according
        to a principle of their religion, condemned the other nations of the
        earth, and regarded them as strangers from the covenants of promise,
        having no hope, and without God in the world. In this manner the Jews
        were seated as on a tribunal, from which they pronounced judgment on all
        other men. Paul, then, had good reason for apostrophizing the Jew as
        thou that judgest. But as there were also distinctions among the Jews
        themselves, and as the priests, the scribes, and chiefly the Pharisees,
        were regarded as more holy than others, he says, whosoever thou art, —
        thus not excepting even one of them. Thou art inexcusable. — Paul
        intended to bring in all men guilty before God, as appears by what he
        says in the 19th verse of the third chapter, ‘that every mouth may be
        stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.’ He had already
        proved the inexcusableness of the Gentiles, and he here proceeds to do
        the same respecting the Jews, whom he addresses directly, and not in a
        manner only implying that he refers to them, as is supposed by
        Professors Tholuck and Stuart. Mr. Stuart, especially, endeavors to show
        that in the first part of this chapter Paul does not proceed at once to
        address the Jews, ‘but first,’ he says, ‘prepares the way, by
        illustrating and enforcing the general proposition, that all who have a
        knowledge of what is right, and approve of it, but yet sin against it,
        are guilty.’ This view of the passage is equally erroneous with that of
        those who suppose that the Apostle is addressing the philosophers and
        magistrates. Both these interpretations lead away from the true meaning
        of the several parts of the chapter, through the whole of which the
        address to the Jew is direct and exclusive. The Apostle’s object was to
        conduct men to the grace of the Gospel, and so to be justified in the
        way of pardon and acquaintance. Now, in order to this, their conviction
        of sin and of their ruined condition was absolutely necessary, since
        they never would have recourse to mercy, if they did not feel compelled
        to confess themselves condemned. It is with this view that he here
        proceeds to strip the Jews, as he had done the Gentiles, of all excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself — Wherein,
        that is, in the thing in which thou condemnest another, thou condemnest
        thyself. Dr. Macknight translates it whilst. But though the words in the
        original thus translated often in certain situations bear this
        signification, here this cannot be the case. When there is nothing in
        the context to fix the reference, the most general substantive must be
        chosen. There is nothing in the context to suggest the idea of time, and
        thing is a more general idea. It is indeed true that the
        self-condemnation of the Jew is contemporaneous with his condemnation of
        the Gentile. But it is so, because this is implied in the very thing
        that is alleged, and the thing alleged is more important than the time
        in which it occurs. Nothing, then, is gained by thus deviating from the
        common version. The translation, because that, which is suggested by
        Professors Tholuck and Stuart as a possible meaning, is also to be
        rejected. To suggest a great variety of possible meanings has the worst
        tendency; instead of serving the truth, it essentially injures it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, as has been remarked, the cause of the condemnation of the Jew
        was not his judging the Gentiles: the cause of his condemnation was his
        doing the things which he condemned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasoning of the Apostle is clear and convincing. It consists of
        three particulars, on which the Jew had nothing to object, namely, — 1st
        , Thou judgest another; 2nd , Thou doest the same things; 3rd , Thou
        condemnest thyself; consequently thou art without excuse. Thou judgest
        another. — That is to say, Thou holdest the Gentiles to be criminal and
        guilty before God; thou regardest them as people whom God has abandoned
        to themselves, and who, therefore, being plunged in vice and sin of all
        kinds, are the objects of His just vengeance. This is what the Jew could
        not deny. Thou doest the same things. — This the Apostle was to prove in
        the sequel. Thou condemnest thyself: — The consequence is unavoidable;
        for the same evidence that convicts the Gentiles in the judgment of the
        Jew, must, if found in him, also bring him in guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
        against them which commit such things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul proceeds here to preclude a thought that might present itself, and
        to stifle it as it were, before its birth. It might be suggested that
        the judgment of God — that is, the sentence of condemnation with respect
        to transgressors — is not uniform; that He condemns some and acquits
        others, as it pleases Him; and therefore, although the Jew does the same
        things as the Gentile, it does not follow that he will be held equally
        culpable, — God having extended indulgence to the one, which He has not
        vouchsafed to the other. The Jew, then, does not hold himself guilty
        when he condemns the Gentile, although he does the same things. This is
        the odious and perverse imagination which the Apostle here repels. We
        are sure, or more literally, we know. Who knows? ‘Koppe,’ says Mr.
        Tholuck, ‘deems that there is here an allusion to the Jews, who boasted
        that they alone possessed the true knowledge.’ But this is palpably
        erroneous, because the Jews in general did not believe the thing
        asserted to be known. The Apostle’s object is to correct their error.
        Mr. Tholuck himself is still farther astray when he understands it of
        ‘those apprehensions of a Divine judgment which are spread among all
        mankind, to which the Apostle had alluded, ch. 1:32.’ It was the Apostle
        himself, and those taught by the same Spirit, who knew with unfaltering
        assurance the thing referred to. The judgment of God, — that is,
        sentence of condemnation, — not, as Dr. Macknight says, the curse of the
        law of Moses. The law of Moses and its curse are different from the
        sentence which God pronounces according to them. According to truth,
        against them which commit such things. — Not truly . This would qualify
        the assertion that the judgment of God is against such persons, which,
        as a general truth, neither the Jew nor the Gentile is supposed to
        question. In this sense, truly would express the same as really. Nor
        does it signify according to truth, as synonymous with justice, as Mr.
        Tholuck supposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        About the justice of the thing there is no question. If the Gentile is
        justly condemned for every breach of the law written on the heart, the
        justice of the condemnation of the transgressing Jew could not be a
        question. Nor, with Mr. Stuart, is it to be understood as meaning,
        agreeably to the real state of things, — that is, according to the real
        character of the person judged. This is doubtless a truth, but not the
        truth asserted in this passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meaning applies to the judgment that examines and distinguishes
        between the righteous and the wicked. But the judgment here spoken of,
        is the sentence of condemnation with respect to transgressors. Nor, with
        Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight, are we to understand this phrase as signifying, ‘according to
        the true meaning of God’s covenant with the fathers of the Jewish
        nation.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not expressed in the text, nor is it suggested by the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real import of this phrase will be ascertained in considering the
        chief error of the Jews about this matter. While they admitted that
        God’s law, in general, condemns all its transgressors, yet they hoped
        that, as the children of Abraham, God would in their case relax the
        vigor of His requirements. What the Apostle asserts, then, is designed
        to explode this error. If God should sentence Gentiles to condemnation
        for transgression of the work of the law written in the heart, and pass
        a different sentence on Jews transgressing the law of Moses, His
        judgment or sentence would not be according to truth. If some
        transgressors escaped, while others were punished, the truth of the
        threat or penalty was destroyed. The truth of God in His threatening, or
        in the penalty of the breach of His law, is not affected by the
        deliverance of those saved by the Gospel. The penalty and the precept
        are fulfilled in Jesus Christ the surety. While God pardons, He by no
        means clears the guilty. His people are absolved, because they are
        righteous; they have fulfilled the law, and suffered its penalty, in the
        death and obedience of Jesus Christ, with whom they are one. The object
        of the Apostle, then, was to undeceive the Jew in their vain hope of
        escape, while they knew themselves to be transgressors. And it equally
        applies to nominal Christians. It is the most prevalent ground of hope
        among false professors of Christianity, that God will not be so strict
        with them as His general threatening declares, because of their relation
        to Him as His professed people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
        things and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinkest thou. — This question evidently implies that the Jews did think
        they would escape, while they committed the very sins for which they
        believed the heathens would be condemned. This affords a key to the
        meaning of the foregoing phrase, according to truth, which implies the
        contrary of this, namely, that all will be punished according to the
        truth of the threatening or penalty. Escape. — This expression imports
        three things: first, that the Jew could not avoid being judged; second,
        that he could not avoid being condemned; and third, that he could not
        prevent the execution of the sentence that God will pronounce. We may
        decline the jurisdiction of men, or even, when condemned by them, escape
        from their hands, and elude the execution of their sentence; but all
        must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; all must be judged
        according to their works; and all who are not written in the book of
        life shall be cast into the lake of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may here observe how prone men are to abuse, to their own
        destruction, those external advantages which God bestows on them. God
        had separated the Jews from the Gentiles, to manifest Himself unto them;
        and, by doing so, He had exalted them above the rest of the world, to
        whom He had not vouchsafed the same favor. The proper and legitimate use
        of this superiority would have been to distinguish themselves from the
        Gentiles by a holy life. But instead of this, owing to a fatal
        confidence which they placed in this advantage, they committed the same
        sins as the Gentiles, and plunged into the same excesses. By this means,
        what they considered as an advantage became a snare to them; for wherein
        they judged others, they condemned themselves. We may likewise remark
        how much self-love blinds and betrays men into false judgments. When all
        the question was respecting the Gentiles, the Jews judged correctly, and
        conformably to Divine justice; but when the question is respecting
        themselves, although they were equal in guilt, they would not admit that
        they were equally the subjects of condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance,
        and long suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
        repentance?
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodness. — This is the best translation of the word. Mr. Tholuck says
        that it signifies love in general. But the idea expressed is more
        general than love. An object of goodness may be very unworthy of being
        an object of love. A distinction must be made between goodness,
        forbearance, and long-suffering. Goodness imports the benefits which God
        hath bestowed on the Jews. Forbearance denotes God’s bearing with them,
        without immediately executing vengeance — His delaying to punish them.
        It signifies the toleration which He had exercised towards them after
        extending to them His goodness; so that this term implies their
        ingratitude after having received the benefits which God had bestowed,
        notwithstanding which He had continued the course of His goodness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long-suffering signifies the extent of that forbearance during many
        ages, denoting a degree of patience still unexhausted. Their sins were
        not immediately visited with the Divine displeasure, as would be the
        case in the government of men. The term goodness respects their first
        calling, which was purely gratuitous, Deuteronomy 7:7. Forbearance
        respects what had passed after their calling, when, on different
        occasions, the people having offended God, He had, notwithstanding,
        restrained His wrath, and had not consumed them. It is this that David
        celebrates in <19A310> Psalm 103:10, and 106. Long-suffering adds
        something more to forbearance; for it respects a long course of
        ingratitude and sins on the part of that people, and imports an extreme
        degree of patience on the part of God, — a patience which many ages, and
        a vast accumulation of offenses, had not exhausted. The Apostle calls
        all this the riches of His goodness, and long-suffering, and
        forbearance, to mark the greatness of their extent, their value and
        abundance, and to excite admiration in beholding a God all-powerful, who
        has no need of any of His creatures, and is infinitely exalted above
        them, striving for so long a period with an unrighteous, ungrateful,
        rebellious, and stiff-necked people, but striving with them by His
        goodness and patience. This language is also introduced to correct the
        false judgments of men on this patience of God; for they are apt, on
        this account, to imagine that there is no God. If, say they, God
        existed, He would not endure the wicked. They suppose that God does not
        exercise His providence in the government of the world, since He does
        not immediately punish their sins. To repress these impious thoughts,
        the Apostle holds forth this manner of God’s procedure as the riches of
        goodness and patience, in order that the impunity which it appears that
        sinners enjoy, might not be attributed to any wrong principle. Or
        despisest thou. — God’s goodness is despised when it is not improved as
        a means to lead men to repentance, but, on the contrary, serves to
        harden them, from the supposition that God entirely overlooks their sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews despised that goodness; for the greatest contempt that could be
        shown to it was to shut the ear against its voice, and to continue in
        sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is acting as if it were imagined that the justice which lingers in
        its execution has no existence, and that it consists solely in empty
        threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interrogations of the Apostle in this and the preceding verse add
        much force to his discourse. Thinkest thou, says he, that thou canst
        avoid the judgment of God? By this he marks the erroneousness and folly
        of such a thought. Despisest thou the riches of His goodness? This is
        added to indicate the greatness of the crime. Not knowing. — There is no
        necessity, with Professors Tholuck and Stuart, to translate this ‘not
        acknowledging.’ The thing itself the Jews did not know, and the bulk of
        those called Christians are equally ignorant of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole of the Old Testament was sufficiently clear on this point, but
        the Jews excluded the light it furnished. They did so by the
        presumptuous opinion they entertained of their own external
        righteousness, in which they made the essence of holiness to consist,
        imagining that by it they would obtain acceptance with God. They
        likewise did so by the confidence they placed in the promises that God
        had made to Abraham and his posterity, flattering themselves with the
        vain thought that these promises acquired for them a right of impunity
        in their sins. And, finally, they did so by the gross error into which
        they had fallen, that the sacrifices and other legal expiations were
        sufficient to procure the pardon of their sins. By reason of these
        delusive prejudices they remained in their state of corruption, and did
        not penetrate farther into the design of God, who, by lavishing on them
        so much goodness, loudly called them to repentance. Leadeth thee to
        repentance. — It has been already remarked that the Apostle said nothing
        like this when speaking in the first chapter respecting the Gentiles. He
        did not ascribe to God either goodness, or forbearance, or
        long-suffering in regard to them. He did not say that God invited, or
        called, or led them to repentance. This shows, as has also been
        observed, that in the dispensation of providence which regarded them,
        there was no revelation of mercy. But if there was none for the
        Gentiles, it was otherwise with the Jews. The Old Testament contained in
        substance all the promises of the Gospel, as well as the temporal
        covenant which God had made with the Jews, which was a figure and type
        of the spiritual covenant made in Christ; and even all the rigors of the
        law indirectly conducted the Jews to the grace of God, and consequently
        called them to repentance. This call was all along accompanied among
        some of them by the spirit of sanctification, as appears by the example
        of the prophets and others. But with respect to the greater number, it
        remained unaccompanied with that spirit, and consequently continued to
        be merely an external calling, without any saving effect. The Apostle,
        in the following verse, declares that the Jews by their impenitence drew
        down upon themselves the just anger of God. From this it evidently
        follows that God externally calls many to whom He has not purposed to
        give the grace of conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also follows that it cannot be said that when God thus externally
        calls persons on whom it is not His purpose to bestow grace, His object
        is only to render them inexcusable. For if that were the case, the
        Apostle would not have spoken of the riches of His goodness, and
        forbearance, and long-suffering, — terms which would not be applicable,
        if, by such a call, it was intended merely to render men inexcusable.

        Ver. 5. — But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up
        unto thyself wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here intimates that the contempt which the Jews had evinced
        of the Divine calling could not remain unpunished. Thy hardness. — This
        is a figurative expression, and strongly expresses the natural obduracy
        and insensibility of their hearts with respect to God, as impenetrable
        by the strongest external force. Nothing but the power of the Spirit of
        God can overcome it. It is the term which Moses often employs to express
        the obstinacy of Pharaoh. He also employs it to mark the corruption of
        the Israelites; and, in general, the Prophets use it to signify the
        inflexible perversity of sinners. It is in this sense that Ezekiel
        attributes to man a heart of stone, — a heart which does not feel, and
        which nothing in man himself can soften. These passages, and many
        similar ones, denote an inclination to wickedness so strong and so
        rooted, that it has entire possession of the man and of all the powers
        of the soul, without his being able to undeceive himself, and to turn to
        God. It is this also which is marked by the expression impenitent heart;
        for it does not refer merely to the act of impenitence, and to the heart
        being in that state at present, but to the fact of its being so enslaved
        to sin, that it never would or could repent. Dr. Macknight, while he
        admits that the word literally signifies ‘cannot repent,’ most
        erroneously adds, ‘here it signifies, which does not repent.’ The
        greatness of this obduracy was made manifest by the number and force of
        the external invitations which God had employed to lead the Jews to
        repentance, and which the Apostle calls His goodness, forbearance, and
        long-suffering; for these invitations refer to the frequent and earnest
        exhortations of His word, His temporal favors, the afflictions and the
        chastisements He had sent, and all His other dispensations towards the
        Jewish people, respecting which it is said, ‘What could have been done
        more to My vineyard that I have not done in it?’ Isaiah 5:4; and again,
        ‘I have spread out My hands all the day unto a rebellious people,’
        Isaiah 65:2. When men remain inflexible under such calls, it is the
        indication of an awful obduracy, of a heart steeled and shut up in
        impenitence. Such was the state of the Jews. This passage is explicit in
        opposition to all who suppose that God employs nothing for men’s
        conversion but the efficacy of His word, accompanied with other
        circumstances calculated to make an impression on their minds. Without
        the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit, these will always prove
        ineffectual. Thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath. — This is a strong
        expression, and a beautiful figure. It proves that sins will be punished
        according to their accumulation. A man is rich according to his
        treasures. The wicked will be punished according to the number and
        aggravation of their sins. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight makes the whole beauty and energy of the expression to
        evaporate, when he explains it as comprehending the thing referred to by
        an Hebraistic extension of meaning. There are two treasures, which Paul
        opposes to each other, — that of goodness, of forbearance, and
        long-suffering, — and that of wrath; and the one may be compared to the
        other. The one provides and amasses blessings for the creature, the
        other punishments; the one invites to heaven, the other precipitates to
        hell; the one looks on sin to pardon it on repentance, the other regards
        obstinate continuance to punish it, and avenge favors that are despised.
        God alone prepares the first, but man himself the second; and on this
        account the Apostle says, ‘Thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath.’ He
        had just before ascribed to the Jew a hard and impenitent heart, —
        expressions which, as we have seen, signify an entire and settled
        inclination to evil, a corruption which nothing in man can overcome. He
        adds, that by this means he treasures up wrath. This is very far, then,
        from countenancing the opinion of those who say that if men were
        absolutely and entirely unable to convert themselves, they would be
        excusable, and that God could not justly require of them repentance.
        Such is not the doctrine of the Apostle Paul, which, on the contrary,
        teaches that the more a man is hardened in crime, the more he becomes an
        object of Divine justice and wrath. The reason is, that this want of
        power has its seat in the will itself, and in the heart, and that it
        consists in an extreme degree of wickedness and perversity, for which
        there can be no excuse. Against the day of wrath and revelation of the
        righteous judgment of God. — That is, the day of the last judgment,
        which is called the day of wrath, because then the wrath of God will
        display itself upon the wicked without measure. Till that day the
        judgments of heavenly justice remain, as it were, concealed and covered
        under the veil of Divine patience; and till then the sins of men are
        treasured up as in a heap, and punishment is awaiting them. But on that
        day, the coming of which is plainly declared in the Scriptures, but
        which will then be actually revealed, a deluge of wrath will descend
        upon the wicked. It is called the day of the righteous judgment of God,
        namely, of the display of His strict justice; for judgment will then be
        laid to the plummet, and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
        and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place. It will therefore be the
        day of the execution of the justice of God; for it is in its execution
        that it will be fully made manifeSt. When the Apostle speaks here of the
        day of wrath, and of God’s righteous judgment, he refers to the judgment
        of those who are under the law. There is no judgment of God which is not
        according to strict justice; there is none that is a judgment of mercy.
        Mercy and justice are irreconcilable except in Christ, in whom mercy is
        exercised consistently with justice. There is no judgment that admits
        repentance and amendment of life as satisfactory to justice. Repentance
        and amendment are not admitted to stand in the room of righteousness. It
        is a truth to which there is no exception, either with respect to God or
        man, that righteous judgment admits no mercy. The acquittal of the
        believer in that day will be as just as the condemnation of the sinner.
        It will be the day in which God, by Jesus Christ, will judge the world
        in righteousness, according to the strict rules of justice, Acts 17:31,
        in which none will be acquitted except those whom the Lord, in His
        representation of the judgment, calls the ‘righteous,’ Matthew 25:37-46;
        and He calls them righteous because they are really so in Christ Jesus.
        But the judgment to which the Apostle here refers, which he
        characterizes as the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
        judgment of God, is that of the execution of unmingled wrath upon the
        wicked. He is not speaking of believers who are in Christ, but of those
        who are under the law, before which nothing but perfect and personal
        conformity to all its demands can subsist; ‘for as many as are of the
        works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every
        one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of
        the law to do them.’ All the sins of such persons will be punished, but
        especially those of obstinacy and contempt which shall have been shown
        towards the goodness and patience of God; for what the Apostle is here
        aiming at, is to convince the Jews that it is to that judgment those
        will be remitted who reject the grace manifested to them.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 6. — Who will render to every man according to his deeds.</p>
      <p>
        God, as the sovereign judge of men, receives from them their good and
        evil actions. These He takes from their hands, so to speak, such as they
        are, and places them to their account, whether they are to His glory or
        dishonor. Sinners do not calculate upon this righteous procedure. They
        commit sin without thinking of God, and without considering that He
        remembers all their actions. There is, however, an invisible hand which
        is treasuring up all that a man thinks all that he says, and all that he
        does; not the least part is lost; all is laid up in the treasury of
        justice. Then, after God has thus received all, He will also restore
        all, — He will cause to descend again upon men what they have made to
        ascend to Him. To every man. — The judgment will be particular to every
        individual; every one will have to answer for himself This judgment of
        those who are under the law will not receive either an imputation of
        good or of bad works of one to another, as the judgment of those who are
        under grace receives for them the merits of Jesus Christ; but every one
        of the former shall answer for his own proper works. According to his
        deeds. — That is to say, either according to his righteousness, if any
        were found in himself righteous, which will not be the case, for all men
        are sinners, but it will be according to the judgment to require
        righteousness, — or it will be according to his sins, — in one word,
        according as every one shall be found either righteous or unrighteous.
        This signifies also that there will be a diversity of punishment,
        according to the number or greatness of the sins of each individual, not
        only as to the nature, but also the degree, of their works, good or bad;
        for the punishment of all will not be equal, Matthew 11:22,24; Luke
        12:47,48. There will not, however, as the Pharisees imagined, and as
        many nominal Christians suppose, be two accounts for each person, the
        one of his good works, the other of his sins, — the judgment being
        favorable or unfavorable to him according as the one or the other
        predominates; for there will be no balancing this sort. ‘According to
        his deeds,’ means that, in the judgment, God will have no regard either
        to descent or to birth, either to the dignity or quality of the person,
        — or whether he were Jew or Gentile, as to the privileges he enjoyed, or
        any such thing, which might counteract justice, or turn it from its
        course; but that it will regard solely the works of each individual, and
        that their deeds will comprehend everything that is either obedience or
        disobedience to the law of God. The judgment of the great day will be to
        all men according to their works. The works of those who shall be
        condemned will be the evidence that they are wicked. The works of
        believers will not be appealed to as the cause of their acquittal, but
        as the evidence of their union with Christ, on account of which they
        will be pronounced righteous, for in them the law has been fulfilled in
        their Divine surety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — To them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for
        glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patient continuance in well-doing. — This well expresses the sense of
        the original. It signifies perseverance in something arduous. It is not
        mere continuance, but continuance in doing or suffering something that
        tries patience. The word is used to signify perseverance, patience,
        endurance, — a perseverance with resistance to all that opposes, namely,
        to all temptations, all snares, all persecutions, and, in general, to
        all that could discourage or divert from it, in however small a degree.
        It is not meant that any man can produce such a perseverance in good
        works, for there is only one, Jesus Christ, who can glory in having
        wrought out a perfect righteousness. He alone is holy, harmless,
        undefiled, and separate from sinners. But here the Apostle only declares
        what the Divine judgment will demand according to the law, to which the
        Jews were adhering for justification before God, and rejecting that
        righteousness which He has provided in the Gospel. He marks what the law
        will require for the justification of man, in order to conclude from it,
        as he does in the sequel, that none can be justified in this way,
        because are guilty. This shows how ignorantly the Church of Rome seeks
        to draw from this passage a proof of the merit of works, and of
        justification by works, since it teaches a doctrine the very contrary;
        for all that the Apostle says in this chapter is intended to show the
        necessity of another mode of justification than that of the law, namely,
        by grace, which the Gospel sets before us through faith in Jesus Christ,
        according to which God pardons sins, as the Apostle afterwards shows in
        the third chapter. To pretend, then, to establish justification by
        works, and the merit of works, by what is said here, is directly to
        oppose the meaning and reasoning of the Apostle. Seek for glory, and
        honor, and immortality. — Glory signifies a state brilliant and
        illustrious, and honor the approbation and praise of God, which, with
        immortality, designate the blessings of eternal life. These God would,
        without doubt, confer in consequence of perseverance in good works, but
        which cannot be obtained by the law. Here we see a condemnation of that
        opinion which teaches that a man should have no motive in what he does
        in the service of God but the love of God. The love of God, indeed, must
        be the predominant motive, and without it no action is morally good. But
        it is not the only motive. The Scriptures everywhere address men’s hopes
        and fears, and avail themselves of every motive that has a tendency to
        influence the human heart. The principles of human nature have God for
        their author, and are all originally right. Sin has given them a wrong
        direction. Of the expressions, glory and honor, Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight gives the following explanations: — ’Glory is the good fame
        which commonly attends virtuous actions, but honor is the respect paid
        to the virtuous person himself by those who have intercourse with him.’
      </p>
      <p>
        According to this interpretation, those who are seeking for immortality
        and eternal life are seeking for the favor and respect of men! Eternal
        life. — The Apostle does not say that God will render salvation, but
        ‘eternal life.’ The truth declared in this verse, and in those that
        follow, is the same as that exhibited by our Lord when the rich young
        man asked Him, ‘What good thing shall I do that I may inherit eternal
        life?’ His reply was, ‘If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
        commandments,’ Matthew 19:16; and when the lawyer, tempting Him, said,
        ‘Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? ‘Jesus answered, ‘Thou
        shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
        and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as
        thyself,’ Luke 10:25. The verse before us, then, which declares that
        eternal life shall be awarded to those who seek it by patient
        continuance in well-doing, and who, according to the 10th verse, work
        good, both of which announce the full demand of the law, are of the same
        import with the 13th verse, which affirms that the doers of the law
        shall be justified. In all these verses the Apostle is referring to the
        law, and not, as it is generally understood, to the Gospel. It would
        have been obviously calculated to mislead the Jews, with whom Paul was
        reasoning, to set before them in this place personal obedience as the
        way to eternal life, which, in connection with what he had said on
        repentance, would tend directly to lead them to mistake his meaning on
        that subject. But besides this, if these verses refer to the Gospel,
        they break in upon and disturb the whole train of his reasoning, from
        the 18th verse of the first chapter to the 20th of the third, where he
        arrives at his conclusion, that by the deeds of the law there shall no
        flesh be justified in the sight of God. Paul was afterwards to declare
        the way of justification, as he does, ch. 3:21, 26, immediately after he
        drew the above conclusion; but till then, his object was to exhibit,
        both to Jews and Gentiles, the impossibility of obtaining justification
        by any works of their own, and, by convincing them of this, to lead them
        to the grace of the Gospel. In conversing with the late Mr. Robert Hall
        at Leicester, respecting the Epistle to the Romans, he remarked to me
        that this passage had always greatly perplexed him, as it seemed to be
        not only aside from, but even opposed to what appeared, from the whole
        context, to be the drift of the Apostle; and I believe that every one
        who supposes that the Apostle is here referring to the Gospel will
        experience a similar difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that the view here given of these verses is contrary to that of
        almost all the English commentaries on this Epistle. I have consulted a
        great number of them, besides those of Calvin, and Beza, and Maretz, and
        the Dutch annotations, and that of Quesnel, all of which, with one
        voice, explain the 7th and 10th verses of this chapter as referring to
        the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only exception that I am aware of among the English commentaries is
        that of Mr. Fry, who, in his exposition of the 16th verse, remarks as
        follows: — ’He (the Apostle) introduces this statement of the certainty
        of a judgment to come, of the universal guilt and inevitable
        condemnation of mankind in the course of justice, in order to show the
        universal necessity of a Savior, and of that righteousness which was of
        God by faith. And it seems altogether extraordinary that some expositors
        should concede the above account of the last judgment to include a
        description of the Redeemer’s bestowing the reward of the inheritance
        upon His people, and that of such the Apostle speaks when he says, “To
        them that, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek glory, honor, and
        immortality, eternal life;” “Glory, honor, and peace, to every one that
        doeth good.” For most assuredly this is not the language of the
        righteousness of faith, but the exact manner of speaking which the
        Apostle ascribes to the righteousness of the law. To the same purpose
        Mr. Marshall, in his work on The Gospel Mystery of Sanctification, 14th
        edit., p. 94, observes, ‘They grossly pervert these words of Paul, “Who
        will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who, by patient
        continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality,
        eternal life,” where they will have Paul to be declaring the terms of
        the Gospel, when he is evidently declaring the terms of the law, to
        prove that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin, and that no flesh
        can be justified by the works of the law, as appeareth by the tenor of
        the following discourse.’
      </p>
      <p>
        I have noticed that from this passage the Church of Rome endeavors to
        establish the merit of works, and of justification by means of works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, Quesnel, a Roman Catholic, in expounding the 6th verse,
        exclaims, ‘Merites veritables; necessite des bonnes oeuvres. Ce sont nos
        actions bonnes ou mauvaises qui rendent doux ou severe le jugement de
        Dieu!’ ‘Real merits; necessity of good works. They are our good or bad
        actions which render the judgment of God mild or severe!’ And indeed,
        were the usual interpretation of this and the three following verses the
        just one, it must be confessed that this Romanist would have some ground
        for his triumph. But if we take the words in their plain and obvious
        import, and understand the Apostle in this place as announcing the terms
        of the law, in order to prove to the Jews the necessity of having
        recourse to grace, and of yielding to the goodness and forbearance of
        God, leading them to repentance, while he assures them that ‘not the
        hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall
        be justified,’ then the whole train of his discourse is clear and
        consistent. On the other supposition, it appears confused and self
        contradictory, and calculated not merely to perplex, but positively to
        mislead, and to strengthen the prejudices of those who were going about
        to establish their own righteousness. For in whatever way these
        expressions may with certain explanations and qualifications be
        interpreted in an evangelical sense, yet unquestionably, as taken by
        themselves, and especially in the connection in which they stand in this
        place, they present the same meaning as is announced in the 13th verse,
        where the Apostle declares that the doers of the law shall be justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth,
        but obey unrighteous, indignation and wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here describes the wicked by three characteristics. Their first
        characteristic is, that they are contentious; that is, rebellious, and
        murmurers against the Divine laws, quarrelers with God, and indicating
        their natural enmity against God by disapproving of His government or
        authority. The second is, rebels against the truth; that is to say, in
        revolt and at open war against what is true and right concerning God and
        His will as made known to them, and as opposed to unrighteousness, which
        God abhors. The third is, obedient to unrighteousness; that is,
        revolting against what is good, and becoming slaves to what is evil.
        Here a striking contrast is indicated between that contentious spirit
        which disobeys the truth, and yet obeys unrighteousness. The one denotes
        an extraordinary haughtiness, and an exceeding boldness; and the other,
        extreme meanness and servility of soul. They who do not choose to serve
        God as their legitimate sovereign, become the slaves of a master who is
        both a tyrant and usurper. Indignation and wrath. — These two terms
        united, mark the greatness of the wrath of God, proportioned to the
        dignity of the sovereign Judge of the world, to the authority of those
        eternal laws which have been violated, to the majesty of the legislator
        by whom they have been promulgated, to the favors which sinners have
        received from Him, and proportioned also to the unworthiness and
        meanness of the creature compared with God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although, when human passions are ascribed to God, we must not suppose
        that He is affected as we are, yet the expressions employed here show
        that God will certainly punish the wicked. The Scriptures represent God
        in the character of a just judge, as well as of a merciful father. The
        flattering doctrine which insinuates the hope of the final universal
        happiness of transgressors, both of devils and men, is altogether
        without countenance from Scripture. The word of God contains the most
        awful denunciations of the Divine wrath. It is a fearful thing to fall
        into the hands of the living God. Yet some writers lead sinners to hope
        that the character of God will secure them from punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
        evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tribulation and anguish. — These two terms denote the punishment, as the
        indignation and wrath designate the principle on which the condemnation
        proceeds. They also designate the greatness of the punishment. Upon
        every soul of man. — This universality is intended to point to the vain
        expectations of the Jews, that they would be exempt from that
        punishment, and assists in determining the import of the phrase
        ‘according to truth’ in verse 2, meaning what is just. It signifies,
        too, the whole man, for it must not be imagined that the wicked do not
        also suffer in their body. Jesus Christ says expressly that they shall
        come forth unto the resurrection of damnation. This refutes the opinion
        of Socinian heretics and others, who insist that the punishment of the
        wicked will consist in an entire annihilation both of body and soul. The
        terms ‘tribulation and anguish’ signify a pain of sensation, and
        consequently suppose the subsistence of the subject. That doeth evil. —
        The word in the original designates evil workers, as persons who
        practice wickedness habitually. The connection of punishment with sin is
        according to the order of Divine justice; for it is just that those who
        have offended infinite Majesty should receive the retribution of their
        wickedness. It is likewise according to the denunciation of the law,
        whether it is viewed as given externally by the word, or as engraved
        internally in the conscience of every man, for it threatens punishment
        to transgressors. Of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile (literally
        Greek). — In this place, ‘the Jew first’ must mean the Jew principally,
        and implies that the Jew is more accountable than the Gentile, and will
        be punished according to his superior light; for as the Jew will have
        received more than the Gentile, he will also be held more culpable
        before the Divine tribunal, and will consequently be more severely
        punished. His privileges will aggravate his culpability, and increase
        his punishment. ‘You only have I known of all the families of the earth;
        therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities,’ Amos 3:2; Matthew
        11:22; Luke 12:47. But although the judgment will begin with the Jew,
        and on him be more heavily executed, it will not terminate with him, but
        will be also extended to the Gentile, who will be found guilty, though
        not with the same aggravation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good;
        to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glory, honor, and peace. — Glory, as has already been observed, refers
        to the state of blessedness to which those who shall inherit eternal
        life will be admitted; honor, to the praise and approbation of God, to
        which is here added peace. Peace is a state of confirmed joy and
        prosperity. As added to glory and honor, it may appear feeble as a
        climax, but in reality it has all the value that is here ascribed to it.
        No blessing can be enjoyed without it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would glory and honor be without peace? What would they be if there
        was a possibility of falling from the high dignity, or of being
        afterwards miserable? To every man that worketh good. — Happiness, by
        the established order of things, is here asserted to be the inseparable
        consequence of righteousness, so that virtue should never be unfruitful;
        and he who had performed what is his duty, if any such could be found,
        should enjoy rest and satisfaction. This is also according to the
        declaration of the Divine law; for if, on the one hand, it threatens
        transgressors, on the other, it promises good to those who observe it.
        ‘The man that doeth them shall live in them,’ Galatians 3:12. Since,
        then, no righteous man could be disappointed of the fruit of his
        righteousness, it may, in consequence, be asked if any creature who had
        performed his duty exactly would merit anything from God? To this it is
        replied, that the infinite majesty of God, which admits of no proportion
        between Himself and the creature, absolutely excludes all idea of merit.
        For God can never be laid under any obligation to His creature; and the
        creature, who is nothing in comparison of Him, and who, besides, has
        nothing but what God has given him, can never acquire any claim on his
        Creator. Whenever God makes a covenant with man, and promises anything,
        that promise, indeed, engages God on His part, on the ground of His
        truth and faithfulness; but it does not so engage Him as to give us any
        claim of merit upon Him. ‘Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be
        recompensed unto him again?’ Romans 11:35. Thus, in whatever manner we
        view it, there can be before God no merit in men; whence it follows that
        happiness would not be conferred as a matter of right on a man who
        should be found innocent. It must be said, however, that it would be
        given by a right of judgment, by which the order and proportion of
        things is preserved, the majesty of the law of God maintained, and the
        Divine promises accomplished. But, in awarding life and salvation to him
        who has the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, God is both faithful
        and just, on account of the infinite merit of His Son. To the Jew first,
        and also to the Greek. — When glory and honor are promised to the Jew
        first, it implies that he had walked according to his superior
        advantages, and of course would be rewarded in proportion; while the
        Gentile, in his degree, would not be excluded.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 11. — For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
      <p>
        Whatever difference of order there may be between the Jew and the
        Gentile, that difference does not change the foundation and substance of
        the judgment. To have respect to the appearance of persons, or to accept
        of persons, is the vice of an iniquitous judge, who in some way violates
        justice; but the Divine judgment cannot commit such a fault. Besides, we
        must never lose sight of the train of the Apostle’s reasoning. His
        design is to show that the Jews, being, as they really are, sinners
        equally with the Gentiles, are involved with them in the same
        condemnation. This is what he proves by the nature of the Divine
        judgment, which is according to truth, that is, which is perfectly just,
        ver. 2; which renders to every man according to his deeds, ver. 6; and
        which has no respect of persons, ver. 11; and consequently it will be
        equal to the Jew and the Gentile, so that neither the one nor the other
        can defend himself against its sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The declaration that God has no respect of persons is frequently quoted
        as militating against the doctrine of election; but it has no bearing on
        the subject. It relates to men’s character, and God’s judgment according
        to character. Every man will be judged according to his works. This,
        however, does not say that God may not choose some eternally to life,
        and give them faith, and create them unto good works, according to
        which, as evidences that they belong to Christ, they shall be judged.
        God’s sovereign love to the elect is manifested in a way that not only
        shows Him to be just in their justification, but also true to His
        declaration with respect to the future judgment. The assertion of the
        Apostle in this place is a truth of great importance, not only with
        respect to the Jews, but also with respect to the professors of
        Christianity, many of whom fancy that there is a sort of favoritism in
        the judgment of God, that will overlook in some what is in others
        accounted condemnatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
        without law: and as many as have sinned in (or under) law shall be
        judged by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here Paul explains the equality of the judgment, both with respect to
        the Gentiles and the Jews. Without law, that is, a written law; for none
        are without law, as the Apostle immediately afterwards shows. The
        Gentiles had not received the written law; they had, however, sinned,
        and they shall perish — that is to say, be condemned — without that law.
        The Jews had receded the written law; they had also sinned, they will be
        judged — that is to say condemned — by that law; for in the next verse
        Paul declares that only the doers of the law shall be justified; and
        consequently, as condemnation stands opposed to justification, they who
        are not doers of it will be condemned. In one word, the Divine justice
        will only regard the sins of men; and wherever these are found, it will
        condemn the sinner. The Gentiles shall perish without law. They will
        perish, though they are not to be judged by the written law. It is
        alleged by some, that although the Apostle’s language shows that all the
        Gentiles are guilty before God, yet it does not imply that they will be
        condemned; for that they may he guilty, yet be saved by mercy through
        Jesus Christ. But the language of the Apostle entirely precludes the
        possibility of such a supposition. It is not said that they who have
        sinned without law are guilty without law, but that they shall ‘perish
        without law.’ The language, then, does not merely assert their guilt,
        but clearly asserts their condemnation. They shall perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        No criticism can make this expression consistent with the salvation of
        the Gentiles who know not God. They will be condemned by the work of the
        law written in their hearts. Many are inclined to think that the
        condemnation of the heathen is peculiarly hard; but it is equally just,
        and not more severe, than the punishment of those who have sinned
        against revelation. They will not be Judged by the light which they had
        not, nor punished so severely as they who resisted that light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
        doers of the law shall be justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse, with the two following, forms a parenthesis between the 12th
        and 16th, explanatory of the two propositions contained in the 12th.
        Some also include the 11th and 12th in the parenthesis. If this mode of
        punctuation were adopted, the 13th, 14th, and 15th verses would be a
        parenthesis within a parenthesis; but for this there is no occasion, as
        the 11th and 12th verses connect with the 10th, and also with the 16th.
        For not the hearers of the law. — Against what the Apostle had just said
        concerning the equality of the judgment, two objections might be urged,
        — the one in favor of the Gentiles, the other in favor of the Jews. The
        first is, that since God has not given His law to the Gentiles, there
        can be no place for their condemnation, — for how can they be condemned
        as transgressors if they have not received a law? The second objection,
        which is contrary to the first, supposes that the Jews ought to be more
        leniently treated, since God, who has given them His law, has, by doing
        so, declared in their favor, and made them His people: He will
        therefore, without doubt, have a regard for them which He has not for
        the others, whom he has abandoned. The Apostle obviates both these
        objections in this and the two following verses, and thus defends his
        position respecting the equality of the judgment. As for the last of
        them, which he answers first in this 13th verse, he says that it is not
        sufficient for justification before God to have received the law, and
        simply to be hearers of it; but that it must be observed and reduced to
        practice. This is an incontestable truth. For the law has not been given
        as a matter of curiosity or contemplation as a philosophical science,
        but to be obeyed; and the greatest outrage against the law and the
        Legislator, is to hear it and not to take heed to practice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will be in vain, therefore, for the Jew to say, I am a hearer of the
        law, I attend on its services, I belong to the covenant of God, who has
        given me His testimonies. On all these accounts, being a transgressor,
        as he is, he must be condemned. The presence of the article before the
        word law in both the clauses of this verse, which is wanting in the
        preceding verse, shows that the reference is here to the Jews under the
        written law. The doers of the law shall be justified. — By this we must
        understand an exact obedience to the law to be intended, which can
        defend itself against that declaration, ‘Cursed is every one that
        continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
        do them.’ For it is not the same with the judgment of the law as with
        that of grace. The Gospel indeed requires of us a perfect obedience to
        its commands, yet it not only provides for believers’ pardon of the sins
        committed before their calling, but of those also which they afterwards
        commit. But the judgment of the law admits of no indulgence to those who
        are under it; it demands a full and perfect personal observance of all
        its requirements — a patient continuance in well-doing, without the
        least deviation, or the smallest speck of sin; and when it does not find
        this state of perfection, condemns the man. But did not the law itself
        contain expiations for sin? and consequently, shall not the judgment
        which will be passed according to the law, be accompanied with grace and
        indulgence through the benefit of these expiations? The legal expiations
        had no virtue in themselves; but inasmuch as they were figures of the
        expiation made by Jesus Christ, they directed men to His sacrifice. But
        as they belonged to the temporal or carnal covenant, they neither
        expiated nor could expiate any but typical sins, that is to say,
        uncleanness of the flesh, Hebrews 9:13, which were not real sins, but
        only external pollutions. Thus, as far as regarded the legal sacrifices,
        all real sins remained on the conscience, Hebrews 10:1, for from these
        the law did not in the smallest degree discharge; whence it follows that
        the judgment, according to the law, to those who are under it, will be a
        strict judgment according to law, which pardons nothing. The word
        justified occurs here for the first time in this Epistle, and being
        introduced in connection with the general judgment, means being declared
        just or righteous by a judicial sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — For when the gentiles, which have not a law, do by nature the
        things contained in the law, these, having not a law, are a law unto
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        For. — This is the proper translation of the Greek particle, and not
        therefore according to Dr. Macknight, who entirely misunderstands both
        the meaning of the passage itself, and the connection in which it
        stands, and founds upon it a doctrine opposed to all that is contained
        on the subject, both in the Old Testament and the New. This verse has no
        connection with, or dependence whatever on, the foregoing, as is
        generally supposed, but connects with the first clause of verse 12,
        which it explains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with the following verse, it supplies the answer to the
        objection that might be made to what is contained in the beginning of
        that verse, namely, that God cannot justly condemn the Gentiles, since
        He has not given them a law. To this the Apostle here replies, that
        though they have not an external and written law, as that which God gave
        to the Israelites, they have, however, the law of the conscience, which
        is sufficient to establish the justice of their condemnation. This is
        the meaning of that proposition, having not a law, are a law unto
        themselves; and of that other, which show the work of the law written in
        their hearts; by which he also establishes the justice of what he had
        said in the 12th verse, that as many as have sinned without law shall
        also perish without law. He proves it in two ways: 1st , Because they do
        naturally the things that the law requires, which shows that they have a
        law in themselves, since they sometimes act according to its rule; 2nd ,
        He proves it by their not being devoid of a conscience, since, according
        to its decisions, they accuse or excuse one another. This evidently
        shows that they have a law, the work of which is written in their
        hearts, by which they discern the difference between right and wrong —
        what is just, and what is unjust.
      </p>
      <p>
        They who have not a law, — that is, an externally written law, — do by
        nature the things contained in the law. It could not be the Apostle’s
        intention to assert that the heathens in general, or that any one of
        them, kept the law written in the heart, when the contrary had been
        proved in the preceding chapter; but they did certain things, though
        imperfectly, commanded by the law, which proved that they had, by their
        original constitution, a discernment of the difference between right and
        wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        They did nothing, however, in the manner which the law required, that
        is, from the only motive that makes an action good, namely, a spirit of
        obedience, and of love to God. God governs the world in this way. He
        rules the actions of men and beasts by the instincts and affections
        which He has implanted in them. Every good action that men perform by
        nature, they do by their constitution, not from respect to the authority
        of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Pagans do many things that, as to the outward act, are
        agreeable to the law of God, is obviously true, and should not be
        denied. That they do anything acceptable to God is not true, and is not
        here asserted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their
        conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
        accusing or else excusing one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work of the law. — We have here a distinction between the law
        itself, and the work of the law. The work of the law is the thing that
        the law doeth, — that is, what it teaches about actions, as good or bad.
        This work, or business, or office of the law, is to teach what is right
        or wrong. This, in some measure, is taught by the light of nature in the
        heart of every man.
      </p>
      <p>
        There remains, then, in all men, to a certain degree, a discernment of
        what the law requires, designated here the ‘work’ of the law; the
        performance or neglect of which is followed by the approbation or
        disapprobation of the conscience. It has no relation to the authority of
        the lawgiver, as the principle of the law itself; but solely to the
        distinction between actions, as right or wrong in themselves, and the
        hope of escaping future punishment, or of obtaining future reward. The
        love and the reverential fear of God, which are the true principles of
        obedience, have been effaced from the mind; but a degree of knowledge of
        His justice, and the consciousness that the violations of His law
        deserve and will be followed by punishment, have been retained. Written
        in their hearts. — This is an allusion to the law written by the finger
        of God upon tables of stone, and afterwards recorded in the Scriptures.
        The great principles of this law were communicated to man in his
        creation, and much of it remains with him in his fallen state. This
        natural light of the understanding is called the law written in the
        heart, because it is imprinted on the mind by the Author of creation,
        and is God’s work as much as the writing on the tables of stone.
        Conscience witnessing together, — together with the law written in the
        heart. But it may be asked, Are not these two things the same? They are
        not. They are different principles. Light, or knowledge of duty, is one
        thing, and conscience is another. Knowledge shows what is right, — the
        conscience approves of it, and condemns the contrary. We might suppose a
        being to have the knowledge of duty, without the principle that approves
        of it, and blames the transgression. Their thoughts the meanwhile
        accusing, or else excusing between one another. — Not alternately, nor
        in turn. Their reasonings (not thoughts) between one another,
        condemning, or else defending. What is the object of their condemnation
        or defense? Not themselves, but one another; that is, those between whom
        the reasonings take place. The reference evidently is to the fact that,
        in all places, in all ages, men are continually, in their mutual
        intercourse, blaming or excusing human conduct. This supposes a standard
        of reference, — a knowledge of right and wrong. No man could accuse and
        condemn another, if there were not some standard of right and wrong; and
        no man could defend an action without a similar standard. This is
        obviously the meaning of the Apostle. To these ideas of right and wrong
        are naturally joined the idea of God, who is the sovereign Judge of the
        world, and that of rewards and punishments, which will follow either
        good or bad actions. These ideas do not fail to present themselves to
        the sinner, and inspire fear and inquietude. But as, on the other hand,
        self-love and corruption reign in the heart, these come to his support,
        and strive, by vain reasonings, to defend or to extenuate the sin. The
        Gentiles, then, however depraved, lost, and abandoned, and however
        destitute of the aid of the written law, are, notwithstanding, a law to
        themselves, having the law written in their hearts. They have still
        sufficient light to discern between good and evil, virtue and vice,
        honesty and dishonesty; and their conscience enables them sufficiently
        to make that distinction, whether before committing sin, or in the
        commission of it, or after they have committed it. Besides this, remorse
        on account of their crimes reminds them that there is a God, a Judge
        before whom they must appear to render account to Him of their actions.
        They are, then, a law to themselves; they have the work of the law
        written in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the knowledge of the revealed law of God has not been preserved in
        every nation, is, however, entirely to be attributed to human depravity;
        and if it was restored to one nation for the benefit of others, it must
        be ascribed to the goodness of God. The law of God, and the revelation
        respecting the Messiah, had been delivered to all men after the flood by
        Noah, who was a preacher of the everlasting righteousness, 2 Peter 2:5,
        which was to be brought in, to answer the demands of that law. But all
        the nations of the earth had lost the remembrance of it, not liking to
        retain God in their knowledge. God again discovered it to the Jews in
        that written revelation with which they were favored. If it he asked,
        Why was the law vouchsafed in this manner to that nation and not also to
        the Gentiles? Paul explains this mystery, ch. 11: It is sufficient then
        to say that God has willed to make known, by this abandonment, how great
        and dreadful was the fall of the human race, and by that means one day
        to magnify the glory of the grace which He purposed to bestow on men by
        Jesus Christ. He willed to leave a great part of men a prey to Satan, to
        show how great is His abhorrence of sin, and how great was the wrath
        which our disobedience had kindled against the world. But why did He not
        also abandon the Jews? Because He chose to leave some ray of hope in the
        world, and it pleased Him to lay the foundation of redemption by His
        Son.

        But why was the greater part abandoned? Because then was the time of
        Divine wrath and justices and sin must be allowed to abound that grace
        might super abound. Why, in fine, choose the nation of the Jews rather
        than any other nation? Because, without any further reason, it was the
        sovereign good pleasure of God.

        Ver. 16. — In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
        Christ, according to any gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse is to be construed in connection with the 12th, to the
        contents of which the three intermediate verses had given, in a
        parenthesis, the explanatory answers. In the day when God shall judge. —
        It is here assumed by the Apostle that God is the Judge of the world.
        This is a truth which nature and right reason teach. Since intelligent
        creatures are capable of obedience to law, it necessarily follows that
        they have a judge, for the law would be null and void if it were left as
        a dead letter, without a judge to put it in execution. And as there is a
        law common to the whole human race, it must also be admitted that there
        is a common Judge. Now this Judge of all can only be God, for it is only
        God who possesses all the qualifications for such an office. The Apostle
        likewise assumes that there will be a day when God will hold this
        judgment. This is also a truth conformable to right reason, for there
        must be a fired time for rendering public the decrees of justice,
        otherwise it would not be duly honored, since its honor consists in
        being recognized to be what it is before all creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, then, there were only individual judgments, either in this life or
        at death, justice would not be manifested as it ought to be. Hence it
        follows that there must be a public and solemn day in which God will
        execute judgment before the assembled universe. Besides, the Apostle
        here intimates that there will be an end to the duration of the world,
        and the succession of generations; for if there be a day appointed for a
        universal judgment, it follows that all men must there appear. And if
        such be the case, their number must also be determined, while, without a
        single exception, the time of their calling and of their life must
        terminate, so that the succession of generations must come to an end.
        The secrets of men. — It is not here meant that God will judge only
        their secrets, so that their public and known actions should pass
        without being judged; for there is nothing that God does not judge. But
        it is intended to show with what exactness the judgment will proceed,
        since it takes account of things the most secret and the most concealed.
        It will not resemble the judgment of men, which cannot fathom the hearts
        and thoughts. God will not only take cognizance of external, but also of
        internal actions, and will discover even the inmost thoughts of men. All
        actions, then, whether open or secret, will come into judgment; but
        secrets or hidden things are here said to be judged, because they are
        reached by no other judgment. If men can conceal their evil deeds, they
        are safe from human judgment. Not so with respect to the Judge at the
        great day. The most secret sins will then be manifested and punished. By
        Jesus Christ. — God will carry into effect that judgment by Jesus
        Christ. ‘He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world
        in righteousness by that man whom He hath ordained,’ Acts 17:31. Jesus
        Christ will conduct the judgment, not only as it respects believers, but
        also the wicked. If the secrets of men are to be brought into judgment,
        and if Jesus Christ is to be the Judge, He must be the Searcher of
        hearts, Acts 1:24; Revelation 2:23. He must then be truly God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the economy of Jesus Christ there are two extreme degrees, one of
        abasement, the other of exaltation. The lowest degree of His abasement
        was His death and burial. The opposite degree of His exaltation will be
        the last judgment. In the former He received the sentence which
        condemned Him, and which included in His condemnation the absolution of
        His people. In the latter He will pronounce the condemnation or
        absolution of all creatures. In the one, covered over with reproaches,
        and pierced with the arrows of Divine justice, He was exposed on the
        cross as a spectacle to the whole city of Jerusalem, when He cried, ‘My
        God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?’ In the other, arrayed in glory
        and majesty, He will appear before the whole universe, in the glory of
        His Father, who commands all the angels to worship Him. According to my
        Gospel. — Paul calls the Gospel his Gospel, not that he is the author of
        it, for it is solely from God; but to say that of it he is the minister
        and herald, — that it is the Gospel which he preached. The Gospel, in a
        large sense, includes everything revealed by Jesus Christ. The Judgment
        then shall take place according to the declarations therein contained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
        makest thy boast of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here commences the second part of this chapter, where Paul purposes to
        show that all the external advantages of the Jews over the Gentiles were
        unavailing for their protection from the just condemnation of God. In
        the first place, he enumerates all their privileges, on account of which
        the Jews could exalt themselves above the Gentiles. Afterwards he lays
        it to their charge that, notwithstanding all these privileges, they were
        sinners, equally guilty as others. Finally, he shows that, being
        sinners, as they all were, their advantages would avail them nothing,
        and would only aggravate their condemnation. Behold, thou art called a
        Jew. — The Apostle here continues his discourse to the same persons
        whom, from the commencement of the chapter, he had addressed, and now
        calls on the Jew by name. In this verse, and the three following, Paul
        classes the advantages of the Jews under six particulars: 1. Their
        bearing the name of Jew. 2. Having received the Law. 3. Having the true
        God as their God. 4. Knowing His will. 5. Discerning what is evil. 6.
        Their ability to teach and guide other men.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to the first of these, the name Jew embraces three significations: —
        confession, praise, and thanksgiving; and by these three things that
        people was distinguished from all other nations. The Jew alone had been
        chosen as the confessor of God, while all the rest of the world had
        abjured His service. The Jew alone was appointed to celebrate His
        praises, while by others He was blasphemed. The Jew alone was appointed
        to render thanksgiving to God for multiplied benefits received, while
        others were passed by. In that name, then, in which the Jews gloried,
        and which distinguished them from all other nations, and implied all the
        privileges they enjoyed, they possessed already a signal advantage over
        the Gentiles Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart prefer surnamed to called; but
        the name was not exactly what is called a surname. It was the name of a
        whole people. The word called, or denominated, is more appropriate, for
        it answers both to their name as a people and to their religion, both of
        which are comprised in the name Jew. And restest in the law — That is to
        say, thou hast no occasion to study any other wisdom or philosophy than
        the law. It is thy wisdom and thy understanding, Deuteronomy 4:6. The
        term restest signifies two things: the one, that the labor was spared
        the Jews of employing many years and great endeavors, and traveling to
        distant countries, as was the case with other nations, in acquiring some
        knowledge and certain rules of direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law which God had given them rendered this unnecessary, and
        furnished abundantly all that was required for the regulation of their
        conduct. The other idea which this term conveys is, that they had an
        entire confidence in the law as a heavenly and Divine rule which could
        not mislead them, while the Gentiles could have no reliance on their
        deceitful philosophy. And makest thy boast of God — Namely, in having
        Him for their God, and being His people, while the Gentiles, having only
        false gods, were ‘without God in the world,’ Ephesians 2:12. The Jews
        had the true God, the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord who
        had performed glorious miracles in their favor, who had even spoken to
        them from the midst of fire, for the Author of their calling, for their
        Deliverer, for their Legislator, for the Founder of their government,
        and for their King and Protector. His earthly palace was in the midst of
        them; He had regulated their worship, and caused them to hear His voice.
        The other nations possessed nothing similar. They had therefore great
        reason to glory in Him, and on this account David said that in God was
        his strength and his refuge, Psalm 18, 62:7, and <19E401> 144.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — And knowest His wall, and approvest the things that are more
        excellent, being instructed out of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        And knowest His will. — That is, what is agreeable to Him, what He
        requires them to do, what He commands, what He prohibits, what He
        approves, and what He rewards. The term knowest signifies not a confused
        knowledge, such as the Gentiles had by the revelation of nature, but a
        distinct knowledge by the revelation of the word, which the Gentiles did
        not possess. ‘He showeth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His
        judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for
        His judgments, they have not known them,’ <19E719> Psalm 147:19,20. At
        the same time, the Apostle does not mean to say that the Jews had a
        practical knowledge of the will of God, for he immediately accuses them
        of the contrary. And approvest things that are excellent. — This is the
        fifth advantage, which follows from the preceding. They knew the will of
        God, and, knowing that will, they consequently knew what was contrary to
        it; that is to say, those things which God does not approve, and which
        He condemns. For the declaration of what God approves includes, in the
        way of opposition and negation, those things which He does not approve.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we learn the perfection of the written law, in opposition to
        unwritten traditions; for nothing more is needed in order to know the
        will of God, and to discern what contradicts it. Being instructed out of
        the law. — This refers to the two preceding articles — to the knowledge
        of the will of God, and to the discernment of the things that are
        contrary to it. From their infancy the Jews were instructed in the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
        a light of them which are in darkness: This is the sixth advantage,
        depending on those preceding. The law not only instructed the Jews for
        themselves, but also for others, and in this they held that they enjoyed
        a great superiority over the other nations. A guide to the blind. — The
        Gentiles are here called blind, for with all the lights of their
        philosophy, of their laws and their arts, they were after all blind,
        since, with the exception of those of true religion, which they did not
        possess, there is no true saving light in the world. A light of them
        which are in darkness. — The Rabbis called themselves the light of the
        world, to which our Lord appears to refer when He gives this title to
        His Apostles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
        the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes. — These titles explain
        clearly what the others indicate in metaphorical terms, and further
        exalt the privileges of the Jews. Here we may remark that, although to
        the Gentiles God had given abundance of temporal good things, all this
        was still as nothing in comparison of the blessings vouchsafed to the
        Jews. Which hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law. —
        This does not signify semblance in contradistinction to substance, for
        it was the thing of which the Jews boasted. It means the representation
        or exhibition of truth and summary of knowledge which was contained in
        the law. The meaning is the same as when we speak of a body of divinity.
        The Jews considered that they had a body of truth and knowledge in the
        law. In these expressions, then, truth and knowledge are represented as
        embodied in a visible form. The Jews had that form in the law, that is
        to say, the law was to them a form and model, whence they were to take
        all the true notions of God, of His religion, and of the duty of man,
        and a rule to which they ought to be referred. In general, from all
        these advantages which God had so liberally bestowed on the Jews, we may
        collect that His goodness had been great in not entirely abandoning the
        human race, but in having still lighted up for it, in a corner of the
        earth, the lamp of His law, to serve as His witness. His wisdom has not
        been less conspicuous in having thus prepared the way for the mission of
        His Son, and the establishment of His Gospel throughout the whole world.
        For the law was a schoolmaster until the coming of Christ. We also learn
        that when God does not accompany His external favors with the internal
        grace of His Holy Spirit, the depravity of man is such, that, instead of
        turning to God, he multiplies his transgressions, as the Apostle
        immediately proceeds to show by the example of the Jews. We see, too,
        how aggravated was their ingratitude in the midst of such distinguished
        benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — Thou, therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not
        thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
      </p>
      <p>
        This and the two following verses are in the Vulgate without
        interrogation, but the ancient interpreters read them with the
        interrogation. The meaning, in either case, remains the same. After
        having exalted the advantages of the Jews above the Gentiles with as
        much force as they could have done themselves, Paul unveils their
        hypocrisy, and exhibits the vices which were concealed under so fair an
        exterior He afterwards confirms the whole of his charges by the
        testimony of Scripture. In this manner he establishes more fully what he
        had said in the beginning of the chapter, that they condemned
        themselves, and that they could not hope to escape the just judgment of
        God, but were accumulating a treasure of wrath. Teachest thou not
        thyself. — This implies that the Jews did not practice the precepts of
        their law. It implies that they were practically ignorant of it.
        Preachest, or proclaimest. — There is no reason to suppose, with Dr.
        Macknight, that the learned Jews are here the persons addressed. The
        whole of the Jews are addressed as one person. What is said applies to
        them as a body, and does not exclusively relate to the scribes and
        teachers. Should not steal. — The sins here specified were evidently
        such as were practiced among the Jews. They are not merely supposed
        cases, or specifications for illustration. It is taken for granted that,
        as a body, the sins mentioned were very generally chargeable on them.
        Would the Apostle, addressing the Jews as one man, have asked why they
        were guilty of such a sin, if they were not very generally guilty of it?
        Mr. Tholuck, then, has no ground to suppose the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery? thou that
        abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
      </p>
      <p>
        Oppression of the poor, and adultery, are the crimes with which the Jews
        were chiefly charged by our Lord. Abhorrest idols. — The Jews now
        generally abhorred the idolatry to which in the former ages of their
        history they were so prone, even in its grossest forms. The word in the
        original signifies to abominate, alluding to things most disagreeable to
        the senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is according to God’s account of the sin of idolatry. According to
        human standards of morality, idolatry appears a very innocent thing, or
        at least not very sinful; but in Scripture it is classed among the works
        of the flesh, Galatians 5:20, and is called ‘abominable,’ 1 Peter 4:3.
        It robs God of His glory, transferring it to the creature. Commit
        sacrilege. — The word here used literally applies to the robbery of
        temples, for which the Jews and many opportunities, as well as of
        appropriating to themselves what was devoted to religion, as is
        complained of, Nehemiah 13:10; and of robbing God in tithes and
        offerings, Malachi 3:8; also of violating and profaning things sacred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
        law, dishonorest thou God ?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews gloried in the law as their great national distinction, yet
        they were egregiously guilty of breaking it, which was highly
        inconsistent and dishonorable to God, not merely ‘as God was the author
        of the law,’ which is the explanation of Mr. Stuart, but because they
        professed to be God’s people and to glory in His law. In any other
        light, the breach of the law by the Gentiles, when they knew it to be
        God’s law, would have been equally dishonorable to God. But God is
        dishonored by the transgressions of His people, in a manner in which He
        is not dishonored by the same transgressions in the wicked, who make no
        profession of being His. It is a great aggravation of the sins of God’s
        people, if they are the occasion of bringing reproach on His religion.
        The world is ready to throw the blame on that religion which He has
        given them; and it is for this that the Apostle, in the following verse,
        reproaches the Jews in regard to the heathen. Sinners also are thus
        emboldened to sin with the hope of impunity, and opposers make it a
        handle to impede the progress of Divine truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears that in the above three verses the Apostle alludes to what is
        said, Psalm 50:16-21. ‘But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to
        do to declare My statutes, or that thou shouldst take My covenant in thy
        mouth? Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest My words behind thee.
        When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been
        partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue
        frameth deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou
        slanderest thine own mother’s son. These things hast thou done, and I
        kept hence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as
        thyself: but I was reprove thee, and set them in order before thine
        eyes.’ On this it may be remarked, that the 50th Psalm predicts the
        change which God was to make in His covenant at the coming of the
        Messiah, and likewise His rejection of His ancient people. As to the
        change of the covenant, it was declared that the sacrifices of the law
        were not acceptable to Him, and that henceforth He will not require from
        men any other than those of praises, thanksgivings, and prayers, which
        are the only acceptable worship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Respecting the rejection of His ancient people, God reproaches them with
        their crimes, and more especially with hypocrisy, which are precisely
        the charges made against them in this place by the Apostle. The
        conclusion from the whole is, that the pretended justification of the
        Jews by the external advantages of the law was a vain pretense; and
        that, as they had so vilely abused the law of which they boasted,
        according to the prediction of the Psalmist, it must follow that the
        accusation now brought against them was established.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle, in these verses, exhibits the most lively image of
        hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was there ever a more beautiful veil than that under which the Jew
        presents himself? He is a man of confession, of praise, of thanksgiving;
        a man whose trust is in the law, whose boast is of God, who knows His
        will, who approves of things that are excellent; a man who calls himself
        a conductor of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness, an
        instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of babes; a man who directs
        others, who preaches against theft, against adultery, against idolatry;
        and, to sum up the whole, a man who glories in the commandments of the
        Lord. Who would not say that this is an angel arrayed in human form — a
        star detached from the firmament and brought nearer to enlighten the
        earth? But observe what is concealed under this mask. It is a man who is
        himself untaught; it is a thief, an adulterer, a sacrilegious person, —
        in one word, a wicked man, who continually dishonors God by the
        transgression of His law. Is it possible to imagine a contrast more
        monstrous than between these fair appearances and this awful reality?
      </p>
      <p>
        Doubtless Paul might have presented a greater assemblage of particular
        vices prevalent among the Jews, for there were few to which that nation
        was not addicted. But he deems it sufficient to generalize them all
        under these charges, — that they did not teach themselves that they
        dishonored God by their transgressions of the law; and of these vices he
        has only particularized three, namely, theft, adultery, and sacrilege:
        and this for two reasons, — first, because it was of these three that
        God had showed the greatest abhorrence in His law; and, secondly,
        because these three sins, in spite of all their professions to the
        contrary, were usual and common among the Jews. There was no people on
        earth more avaricious and self-interested than they. It is only
        necessary to read the narrations of their prophets and historians, to be
        convinced how much they were addicted to robbery, to usury, and to
        injustice. They were no less obnoxious to the charge of fornication and
        adultery, as appears from the many charges preferred against them in the
        writings of the Prophets. They converted the offerings to the purposes
        of their avarice, they profaned the holy places by vile and criminal
        actions; and as the Lord Himself, after Jeremiah, upbraided them they
        turned God’s house of prayer into a den of thieves.
      </p>
      <p>
        These three capital vices, which the Apostle stigmatizes in the Jews,
        like those which he had preferred against the Gentiles, stand opposed,
        on the one hand, to the three principal virtue which he elsewhere
        enumerates as comprehending the whole system of sanctity, namely, to
        live soberly, righteously, and godly; and, on the other hand, they are
        conformable to the three odious vices which he had noted among the
        Gentiles, namely, ungodliness, intemperance, unrighteousness. For theft
        includes, in general, every notion of unrighteousness; adultery includes
        that of intemperance; and the guilt of sacrilege, that of ungodliness.
        Hence it is easy to conclude that, whatever advantages the Jews
        possessed above the Gentiles, they were, notwithstanding, in the same
        condition before the tribunal of God, — like them unrighteous, like them
        intemperate, like them ungodly, and, consequently, like them subjected
        to the same condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
        you, as it is written.
      </p>
      <p>
        The charge alleged here against the Jews, is not that they themselves
        blasphemed the name of God as some understand it, but that they gave
        occasion to the heathen to blaspheme. The Apostle is not charging the
        Jews with speaking evil of God, or with one particular sin, but with the
        breach of their law in general. He here confirms what he had just said
        to this purpose in the foregoing verse, by the authority of Scripture.
        Many suppose that he refers to a passage of Isaiah 52:5, where the
        Prophet says, ‘And my name continually every day is blasphemed.’ But
        there the Prophet does not charge the Jews as having, by their bad
        conduct, occasioned the injury which the name of God received. He
        ascribes it, on the contrary, to the Assyrians, by whom they had been
        subjected. In the passage before us, the reference is to Ezekiel
        36:17-20, where it is evident that the Jews, by the greatness and the
        number of their sins, had given occasion to the Gentiles to insult and
        blaspheme the holy name of God, which is precisely the meaning of the
        Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gentiles, as the Prophet there relates, seized on two pretexts to
        insult the name of God, — the one drawn from the afflictions which the
        sins of His people had brought upon them, and the other from the
        contemplation of the sins themselves. According to the first, they
        accused the God of Israel of weakness and want of power, since He had
        not saved His people from so miserable a dispersion. According to the
        second, they imputed to the religion and the God of the Israelites all
        the crimes which they saw that people commit, as if it had been by the
        influence of God Himself that they were committed. It is on account of
        these two arrogant and malignant accusations that God reproaches His
        people for having profaned His name among the nations; and adds (not for
        the sake of His people, who had rendered themselves altogether unworthy,
        but for that of His own name) two promises opposed to those two
        accusations, — the one of deliverance, the other of sanctification: —
        ’For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all
        countries, and will bring you unto your own land. Then will I sprinkle
        clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean,’ Ezekiel 36:24,25. I will
        deliver you, in order to repel their insult on Me, in accusing Me of
        want of power. I will cleanse you, in order to vindicate Myself from the
        accusation of being the author of your crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        God had no need of either of these ways of justifying Himself. He had
        shown, on numerous occasions, the irresistible power of His arm in favor
        of the Israelites; and the sanctity of His law was self-evident. Yet He
        promises to do these things for His own glory, inasmuch as the Gentiles
        and His people had dishonored His name.
      </p>
      <p>
        No accusation against the Jews could be more forcible than that which,
        in the verse before us, was preferred from the testimony of their own
        Scriptures. It proved that not only were they chargeable before God with
        their own sins, but that they were likewise chargeable with the sins
        which the Gentiles committed in blaspheming His name. This showed
        clearly that they were no more prepared to sustain the judgment of the
        strict justice of God than were the Gentiles, whom they were as ready to
        condemn as the Apostle himself was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — For circumcisions verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but
        if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
        uncircumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here pursues the Jew into his last retreat, in which he imagined
        himself most secure. He presses him on the subject of circumcision,
        which the Jews viewed as their stronghold — that rite even more ancient
        than Moses, and by which they were distinguished from the other nations.
        The sum of this, and the following verses to the end of the chapter, is,
        that the Jews being such as the Apostle had represented them, all their
        advantages, including circumcision, could only enhance their
        condemnation before the tribunal of God, and that, on the contrary, if
        the Gentiles, who have not received the law, observed its precepts, they
        would be justified without circumcision. Two things are here to be
        observed, namely, what is asserted of the Jews and Gentiles, and the
        proof that follows. The assertions are, that circumcision serves only as
        a ground of condemnation to transgressors of the law; and, on the other
        hand, that the want of it would be no detriment to those who fulfilled
        the law. The proof is, that before God the true Jew and the true
        circumcision consist not in external qualities, but in internal and real
        holiness. The reason why circumcision was not included in the
        enumeration before given of the advantages of the Jews is, that in
        itself it is not an advantage, but only a sign of other advantages; and
        it is mentioned here, because, in the character of a sign, it includes
        them: to name circumcision then, is to refer to them all. In this verse
        the Apostle does not speak of circumcision according to its real and
        most important signification as he does in the two concluding verses,
        but in that view in which the Jews themselves considered it, as the
        initiatory and distinctive rite of their religion, without the
        observance of which they believed they could not be saved. Circumcision
        verily profiteth, if thou keep the law. — It is not meant that
        circumcision will come into the account before the tribunal of God, as
        the fulfilling of the law, but that it would be an aid and motive to the
        observance of the law, and viewed in the light of an obligation to keep
        the law; if the Jew had kept it, he could refer to his circumcision as
        an obligation which he had fulfilled. Circumcision may be viewed in two
        lights, either as given to Abraham, or as enjoined by Moses. 1. It was
        the token of the covenant that Abraham should be the father of the
        promised Savior, and, moreover, a seal or pledge of the introduction and
        reality of the righteousness imputed to him through faith, while
        uncircumcised, in order that he might be the father of all believers,
        whether circumcised or not, to whom that righteousness should also be
        imputed. 2. Circumcision, as enjoined by Moses, was a part of his law,
        John 7:22,23. In the first view, it was connected with all the
        privileges of Israel, Philippians 3:4,5; in the second, it was a part of
        the law, whose righteousness is described, Romans 10:5. f14 The Jews
        entirely mistook the object of the law, Romans 5:20, Galatians 3:19,
        which shut up all under sin, Galatians 3:22, by cursing every one who
        continued not in all things written in the book of the law to do them;
        and in this view, as a part of the law of Moses, circumcision could only
        profit those who kept the whole law. But instead of this, the name of
        God was blasphemed among the Gentiles, through the wickedness of the
        Jews, and hence their having the form of knowledge and of the truth in
        the law would only aggravate their condemnation. When, therefore, the
        Apostle says, if thou keep the law, he supposes a case, not implying
        that it was ever verified; but if it should exist, the result would be
        what is stated. If, on the other hand, the Jew was a breaker of the law,
        his circumcision was made uncircumcision, Jeremiah 9:26; it would be of
        no more avail than if he had not received it, and would give him no
        advantage over the uncircumcised Gentile. This declaration is similar to
        the way in which our Lord answers the rich young man. If the law is
        perfectly kept, eternal life will be the reward, as the Apostle had also
        said in verses 7 and 10; but if there be any breach of it, circumcision
        is of no value for salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of
        the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle does not mean to affirm that an uncircumcised Gentile can
        fulfill the righteousness of the law, nor does he here retract what he
        had said in the first chapter respecting the corruption and guilt of the
        Gentiles, but he supposes a case in regard to them like that concerning
        the Jews in the preceding verse. This hypothetical mode of reasoning is
        common with Paul, of which we have an example in this same chapter,
        where he says that the doers of the law shall be justified; of whom,
        however, in the conclusion of his argument, ch. 3:19, he affirms that
        none can be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        The supposition, then, as to the obedience of the Gentile, though in
        itself impossible, is made in order to prove that, before the judgment
        seat of God, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision enters at all into
        consideration for justification or condemnation. If an uncircumcised
        Gentile kept the law, his uncircumcision would avail as much as the
        circumcision of the Jew. The reason of this is, that the judgment of God
        regards only the observance or the violation of the law, and not
        extraneous advantages or disadvantages, and, as is said above, with God
        there is no respect of persons. In reality, then, the Jews and Gentiles
        were on a level as to the impossibility of salvation by the law; in
        confirmation of which truth, the inquiry here introduced is for the
        conviction of the Jew on this important point. But what is true upon a
        supposition never realized, is actually true with respect to all who
        believe in Jesus. In Him they have this righteousness which the law
        demands, and without circumcision have salvation. Dr. Macknight
        egregiously errs when he supposes that the law here referred to is the
        law of faith, which heathens may keep and be saved: this is a
        complication of errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2 7 — And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it
        fulfill the law judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost
        transgress the law ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul continues in this verse to reason on the same supposition as in the
        one preceding, and draws from it another consequence, which is, that if
        the Gentile who is uncircumcised fulfilled the law, he would not only be
        justified, notwithstanding his uncircumcision, but would judge and
        condemn the circumcised Jew who did not fulfill it. The reason of this
        conclusion is, that in the comparison between the one and the other, the
        case of the circumcised transgressor would appear much worse, because of
        the superior advantages he enjoyed. In the same way it is said, Matthew
        12:41, that the Ninevites shall condemn the Jews. The uncircumcision
        which is by nature. — That is to say, the Gentiles in their natural
        uncircumcised state, in opposition to the Jews, who had been
        distinguished and set apart by a particular calling of God. Dr.
        Macknight commits great violence when he joins the words ‘by nature’
        with the words ‘fulfill the law,’ as if it implied that some Gentiles
        did fulfill the law by the light of nature. Who by the letter and
        circumcision dost transgress the law. — Dr. Macknight affirms that the
        common translation here ‘is not sense.’ But it contains a very important
        meaning. The Jews transgressed the law by means of their covenant and
        circumcision being misunderstood by them. This fact is notoriously true:
        they were hardened in their sin from a false confidence in their
        relation to God. Instead of being led to the Savior by the law,
        according to its true end, they transgressed it, through their views of
        the letter of the law and of circumcision; of both of which, especially
        of circumcision, they made a savior. The fulfilling of the law and its
        transgression are here to be taken in their fullest import, namely, for
        an entire and complete fulfillment, and for the slightest transgression
        of the law; for the Apostle is speaking of the strict judgment of
        justice by the law, before which nothing can subsist but a perfect and
        uninterrupted fulfillment of all the commandments of God. But it may be
        asked how the uncircumcised Gentiles could fulfill the law which they
        had never received.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could not indeed fulfill it as written on tables of stone and in
        the books of Moses, for it had never been given to them in that way; but
        as the work of the law, or the doctrine it teaches, was written in their
        hearts, it was their bounded duty to obey it. From this it is evident
        that in all this discussion respecting the condemnation of both Gentiles
        and Jews, the Apostle understands by the law, not the ceremonial law, as
        some imagine, but the moral law; for it is the work of it only which the
        Gentiles have by nature written in their hearts. Besides, it is clear
        that he speaks here of that same law of which he says the Jews were
        transgressors when they stole, committed adultery, and were guilty of
        sacrilege.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
        circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: Ver. 29. — But he is a Jew,
        which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
        spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle now passes to what is reality, not supposition, and gives
        here the proof of what he had affirmed, namely, that circumcision
        effects nothing for transgressors of the law, except to cause their
        deeper condemnation, and that the want of circumcision would be no loss
        to those who should have fulfilled the law. The reason of this is, that
        when the Jew shall appear before the tribunal of God, to be there
        judged, and when he shall produce his title as a Jew, as possessing it
        by birth, and his circumcision, as having received it as a sign of the
        covenant of God, God will not be satisfied with such appearances, but
        will demand of him what is essential and real. Now the essence and
        reality of things do not consist in names or in eternal signs; and when
        nothing more is produced, God will not consider a man who possesses them
        as a true Jew, nor his circumcision as true circumcision. He is only a
        Jew in shadow and appearance, and his is only a figurative circumcision
        void of its truth. But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; that is to say,
        that in judging, God will only acknowledge as a true Jew, and a true
        confessor of His name, him who has the reality, — namely, him who is
        indeed holy and righteous, and who shall have fulfilled the law; for it
        is in this fulfillment that confession, and praise, and giving of thanks
        consist, which are the things signified by the name Jew. It is thus we
        are to understand the contrast which Paul makes between ‘outwardly’ and
        ‘inwardly.’ What is outward is the name, what is inward is the thing
        itself represented by the name. And circumcision is that of the heart,
        in the spirit, and not in the letter. — It is essential to keep in view
        that here, and in all that precedes, from the beginning of the 18th
        verse of the first chapter, Paul is referring not to the Gospel, but
        exclusively to the law, and clearing the ground for the establishment of
        his conclusion in the following chapter, verses 19th and 20th,
        concerning the universal guilt of mankind, and the consequent
        impossibility of their being justified by the law. The whole is intended
        to prepare the way for the demonstration of the grand truth announced,
        ch. 1:17, and resumed, ch. 3:21, of the revelation of a righteousness
        adequate to the demands of the law, and provided for all who believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a misapprehension in this respect, very erroneous explanations have
        been given by many of this verse and the context, as well as of the 7th,
        8th, 9th, and 10th of the second chapter, representing these passages as
        referring to the Gospel, and not exclusively to the law. This introduces
        confusion into the whole train of the Apostle’s reasoning, and their
        explanations are entirely at variance with his meaning and object. And
        circumcision . — This passage is often considered as parallel to that in
        the Epistle to the Colossians, ch. 2:11. ‘In whom also ye are
        circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the
        body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ.’ But the
        purpose of the Apostle in the one place and the other is altogether
        different. Many passages, in different connections, which are similar in
        their expressions, are not so at all in their meanings. For the
        illustration of this, it is necessary to remember that the Apostle, as
        has just been observed, is here referring solely to the law, and
        likewise that circumcision in one view respected the legal covenant, of
        which it was a ceremonial obligation, and in another, the evangelical
        covenant, of which it was a type.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the character of a ceremonial obligation of the legal covenant, it
        represented the entire and perfect fulfilling of the law, which
        consisted not merely in external holiness, but in perfect purity of
        soul; and in this sense it represented what no man possessed, but which
        every man must have in order to be justified by the law. In the
        character of a type, it represented regeneration and evangelical
        holiness, which consists in repentance and amendment of life by the
        Spirit of Christ, and in that sense shadowed forth what really takes
        place in those who believe in Jesus Christ. In Colossians, 2:11, the
        Apostle views it in this last aspect; for he means to say that what the
        Jew had in type and figure under the law, the believer has in reality
        and truth under the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the passage before us Paul views it in its first aspect; for he
        is treating of the judgment of strict justice by the law, which admits
        of no repentance or amendment of life. The meaning, then, here is, that
        if the Jew will satisfy himself with bringing before the judgment of the
        law what is only external and merely a ceremonial observance, without
        his possessing that perfect righteousness which this observance denotes,
        and which the Judge will demand, it will serve for no purpose but his
        condemnation. That of the heart in the spirit. — That is to say, what
        penetrates to the bottom of the soul; in one word, that which is real
        and effective. The term spirit does not here mean the Holy Spirit, nor
        has it a mystical or evangelical signification; but it signifies what is
        internal, solid, and real, in opposition to that which was ceremonial
        and figurative. And not in the letter. — Not that which takes place only
        in the flesh, according to the literal commandment, and in all the
        prescribed forms. In one word, it is to the spiritual circumcision that
        the Apostle refers, which is real in the heart and spirit. Whose praise
        is not of men, but of God. — Here Paul alludes to the name of Jew, which
        signifies praise, which may be taken either in an active sense, as
        signifying praising, or in a passive sense, as praised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses has taken it in this second meaning; when relating the blessing of
        Jacob, he says, ‘Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise.’ The
        Apostle here takes it in the same way; but he does not mean that this
        praise is of men, but of God. The meaning is, that in order to be a true
        Jew, it is not sufficient to possess external advantages, which attract
        human praise, but it is necessary to be in a condition to obtain the
        praise of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The object of the whole of this chapter is to show that the Jews are
        sinners, violators of the law as well as the Gentiles, and consequently
        that they cannot be justified before God by their works; but that, on
        the contrary, however superior their advantages are to those of the
        Gentiles, they can only expect from His strict justice, condemnation.
        The Jews esteemed it the highest honor to belong to their nation, and
        they gloried over all other nations. An uncircumcised person was by them
        regarded with abhorrence. They did not look to character, but to
        circumcision or uncircumcision. Nothing, then, could be more cogent, or
        more calculated to arrest the attention of the Jews, than this argument
        respecting the name in which they gloried, and circumcision, their
        distinguishing national rite, with which Paul here follows up what he
        had said concerning the demands of the law, and of their outward
        transgressions of its precepts. He had dwelt, in the preceding part of
        this chapter, on their more glaring and atrocious outward violations of
        the law, as theft, adultery, and sacrilege, by which they openly
        dishonored God. Now he enters into the recesses of the heart, of which,
        even if their outward conduct had been blameless, and the subject of the
        praise of men, its want of inward conformity to that law, which was
        manifest in the sight of God, could not obtain his praise.
