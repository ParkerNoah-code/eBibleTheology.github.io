      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 31: — What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who
        can be against us?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the Apostle makes a sudden and solemn pause, while he emphatically
        demands, What shall we then say to these things? What can be said
        against them? Is it possible to value them too highly? What use shall we
        make of such consoling truths? What comfort shall we draw from them? Can
        anything detract from the peace they afford? On the foundation that God
        is for him, the eternal interest of the Christian is secured, and though
        he wrestles not only against flesh and blood, but against principalities
        and powers, and against the rulers of the darkness of this world; though
        of himself he can do nothing, yet, through Christ strengthening him, he
        can do all things. But what shall they say to these things who reject
        the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints; who maintain that God
        allows some to perish whom He hath justified; and that many things,
        instead of working for their good, contribute to their ruin? A
        conclusion entirely the reverse is to be deduced from all the
        consolations previously set forth by the Apostle, in reference to which
        he now exclaims, If God be for us who can be against us?
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression if, which Paul here uses, does not denote doubt, but is a
        conclusion, or consequence, or affirmation, signifying since; as if he
        had said, Since we see by all these things that God is for us, who shall
        be against us? For is it not evident that God is for us, since He hath
        sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba,
        Father;’ since the Spirit helps our infirmities; since all things work
        together for our good; since we are predestinated to be conformed to the
        image of His Son? When we were alienated from Him, He called us; when we
        were sinners, He justified us; and, finally, translating us from a scene
        of trouble and afflictions, He will confer on us a crown of immortal
        glory. Since, then God thus favors us, who can be against us?
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, however, in every age, speak of these things very blasphemously.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are far from being pleasing to man’s wisdom. But they excite a
        different feeling in the breast of every Christian. They give a security
        to God’s people which supports them under a sense of their own weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they had no strength but their own, if there were no security for
        their perseverance but their own resolutions, they might indeed despond;
        for how could they ever arrive at heaven? But as this passage shows,
        that all things are secured by God, and that in His almighty hands all
        the links of the chain that connects them with heaven are indissolubly
        united, they have no language in which they can adequately express their
        wonder, gratitude, and joy. No truth can be more evident than this —
        that although we have innumerable enemies, and are ourselves utter
        weakness, yet, if God be for us, nothing can be so against us as finally
        to do us injury. As the angel said to Gideon, ‘The Lord is with thee,’
        so the same is said in this passage to every Christian. ‘No weapon that
        is formed against thee shall prosper.’ ‘All men forsook me,’ said Paul,
        ‘but the Lord stood by me.’ As God had said to Israel, and Moses, and
        Joshua, so He said, ‘Fear not, Paul, for I am with thee.’ When
        Christians, surrounded with difficulties and enemies, are disposed to
        say, with the servant of Elisha, ‘Alas, what shall we do?’ the passage
        before us speaks the same language as did the Prophet, ‘Fear not, for
        they that be with us, are more than they that be with them,’ and
        likewise that of Hezekiah, ‘There be more with us than with them. With
        them is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and
        to fight our battles.’ It is added, ‘And the people rested themselves
        upon the words of Hezekiah, King of Judah.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us we have two propositions. One is, that God is for
        us; the other, that nothing can be — that is, can prevail — against us.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we may consider who are against, and who is for believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is arrayed against them a formidable host composed of many
        powerful enemies. There are Satan and all wicked spirits; there are the
        world, and indwelling sin; there are all sufferings, and death itself.
        How could believers themselves withstand the power of such antagonists?
        But, on the other hand, the Apostle shows in one word who is for them.
        God, says he, is for us! God is the shield of His people: He holds them
        in His hand, and none can pluck them out of it. ‘The eternal God is thy
        refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 32. — He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
        all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse, the Apostle had comforted believers from the
        consideration that, if God, with all His glorious attributes, were
        engaged for their defense, they might look without dismay upon an
        opposing universe. Here, in order to confirm their confidence in God, he
        presents an argument to prove that God is with them of a truths and also
        to assure them that they shall receive from Him every blessing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two circumstances calculated to inspire distrust in the mind
        of the believer. The one is the affections which press upon him in this
        world; and these of two kinds, namely, such as are common to all men,
        and such as are peculiar to the followers of Christ. The other
        circumstance calculated to cloud the hopes of the Christian, is the sins
        of which he is guilty. When suffering so many troubles, he has
        difficulty in persuading himself that he is favored by God, and is
        ready, with Gideon, to exclaim to the angel, ‘Oh my Lord, if the LORD be
        with us, why then is all this befallen us?’ And, on the other hand, as
        he is by nature a child of wrath, and sins daily, how can he be sure
        that God is with him, and not rather against him? To these objections
        the Apostle here opposes the declaration that God hath not spared His
        own Son, but delivered Him up to the death for His people. No stronger
        argument could be offered in proof of His favor to them than the gift of
        His own Son. Him He has given to redeem them from all their sins and all
        their troubles; while such is the dignity and excellency of Christ, that
        the Apostle, arguing from the greater to the less, further proves that
        after such a gift as that of His own Son, nothing can be refused which
        is consistent with the glory of God and the salvation of their souls. He
        thus assures them of freedom from the evils they might dread from sin
        and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul does not say that the Father has given His Son, but that God has
        given Him. This is calculated to establish the confidence of believers
        more firmly, since, by referring to God, He brings into view all His
        perfections as infinitely good, powerful, wise, and able to render them
        supremely blessed in holiness and eternal glory. Another effect is to
        draw their attention to the greatness of the love of God; for one to
        whom we are in some respects equal may confer upon us His favors, but
        here we are reminded that the bestower is infinitely above us, being the
        Creator to whom we are indebted even for our existence. His goodness,
        then, is so much the more wonderful, that though He is the infinite
        Jehovah, dwelling in light which is inaccessible, of whom it is said
        ‘that He humbleth Himself to behold the things that are in heaven’
        <19B306> Psalm 113:6, still He draws near to us, and condescends to
        raise us up, who are as nothing before Him, and who, being the Creator
        of all things, has set His love on those who are sinful, and poor, and
        miserable.
      </p>
      <p>
        What God has given is His own Son. — This imports that He is His Son in
        the sense of that relation among men. It is sonship in this sense only
        that shows the immensity of the love of God in this gift. This proves
        that it was greater than if He had given the whole creation. If His Son
        were related to Him in merely a figurative sonship, it could not be a
        proof of His ineffable love. God did not spare Him. — Not sparing Him
        may either mean that He spared Him not in a way of justice, 2 Peter 2:4,
        that is, exacted the utmost farthing of debt He had taken upon Him; or
        that He spared Him not in a way of bounty, that is, withheld Him not God
        spared Abraham’s son, but He spared not His own Son. This passage shows
        that Christ was given over by the Father to the sufferings which He
        bore, and that these sufferings were all necessary for the salvation of
        His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had they not been necessary, He would not have exposed His Son to them.
        ‘It became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in
        bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation
        perfect through sufferings.’ From all this it appears that God, who
        cannot deny Himself, 2 Timothy 2:13, could not show mercy to us without
        satisfying the demands of His justice, vindicating the authority of His
        law, and magnifying and honoring all the perfections of His nature.
        Delivered Him up for us all. — When the Jews seized and crucified our
        Lord Jesus Christ, He was delivered up by the Father’s decree, and by
        the direction of His providence, though it was through the guilty
        criminality of the Jews that He was put to death. It took place when His
        appointed hour arrived, for till then they could not accomplish their
        purpose. ‘Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified
        and slain.’ As the Father delivered Him up, the great end of His
        suffering was satisfaction of the justice of God; and as He bore the
        whole curse of the broken law, His people are never, on that account, to
        bear any portion of vindictive wrath. ‘It was exacted, and He answered,’
        Isaiah 53:7. ‘Then;’ says the Son Himself, ‘I restored that which I took
        not away,’ Psalm 69:4. Thus the Father delivered up His Son to
        humiliation, involving an assumption of our nature and our
        transgressions. He delivered Him up to sorrows unparalleled, and even to
        death itself, — to death, not merely involving the dissolution of the
        soul and body, but the weight of the sins of men, and the wrath of God
        against sin. God thus delivered up His Son, that He might rescue us from
        that misery which He might have justly inflicted upon us, and might take
        us, who were children of wrath, into His heavenly presence, and there
        rejoice over us for ever, as the trophies of His redeeming love. For us
        all. — That is, for all to whom the Apostle is writing, whom he had
        addressed as beloved of God, called, saints, Romans 1:7, among whom he
        ranks himself. But as these epistles to the churches equally apply to
        all believers to the end of time, so this expression includes all the
        elect of God — all who have been given to Jesus — all in whose behalf He
        addressed the Father in His intercessory prayer. ‘I pray for them. I
        pray not for the world, but for them which Thou hast given Me,’ John
        17:9,20. That those to whom Paul here refers when he says, ‘for us all,’
        applies to none but believers, is evident, — 1st, because in the
        preceding and following verses the Apostle speaks of those who love God,
        and who are the called according to His purpose; 2nd, he says in express
        terms that He will with Him freely give us all things, which implies
        that we have faith, by which we receive Jesus Christ. This absolute
        gift, then, concerns only those who, being elected by God, believe in
        Him. How shall He not with Him freely give us all things? — This is the
        most conclusive reasoning. If He has given us the greatest gift, He will
        not refuse the lesser. His Son is the greatest gift that could be given,
        — plainly, then, nothing will be withheld from those for whom He has
        given His Son. This also assumes the fact as granted, that Jesus is the
        Son of God in the literal sense; for in no other sense is the inference
        just. If Jesus were only figuratively a son, there is no room to infer,
        from the gift of Him to us, that the Father will give ‘us all things.’
        These ‘all things’ are what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard. He will
        give His Spirit and eternal life. His children are heirs of God and
        joint heirs with Jesus Christ, whom He hath appointed heir of all
        things. The Apostle does not here speak of himself alone, as if this
        were a privilege peculiar to himself, to receive freely all things with
        Christ, but of all believers, — He will freely give us . And the
        expression, How, with which he commences, imports the absolute certainty
        that on all such they shall be bestowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it is here said that God will give us all things, we are reminded
        that all the good things that we obtain or hope for are from God, who is
        the Author of every good and perfect gift: for a man can receive nothing
        except it be given him from heaven; and all that God gives us He gives
        freely, without money and without price. Here it may be remarked that
        the Apostle’s manner of reasoning, who concludes that, since God has not
        spared His own Son but delivered Him up for us all, He will with Him
        also freely give us all things, teaches us that the believer ought to
        reason out of the Scriptures, and draw the necessary consequence from
        what is said in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 33. — Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is
        God that justifieth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the temptations to which the believer is exposed in this life,
        some are from without, others are from within. Within are the alarms of
        conscience, fearing the wrath of God; without are adversity and
        tribulations. Unless he overcomes the first he cannot prevail against
        the last. It is impossible that he can possess true patience and
        confidence in God in his afflictions, if his conscience labors under the
        apprehension of the wrath of God. On this account the Apostle, in the
        fifth chapter of this Epistle, in setting forth the accompaniments of
        justification by faith, first speaks of peace with God, and afterwards
        of glorying in tribulations. In the chapter before us he observes the
        same order; for, in this last part of it, in which he speaks of the
        triumph of the believer, he first fortifies the conscience against its
        fears from guilt, and next secures it against external temptations from
        afflictions. As to the first, he says, ‘Who shall lay anything to the
        charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth; it is Christ that
        died, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession
        for us.’ And as to the last, ‘Who shall separate us from the love of
        Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
        sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors.’
      </p>
      <p>
        He does not mean to say that nothing shall occur to trouble believers,
        but that nothing shall prevail against them. In assuring them of this,
        he ascends to their election as the source of all their blessings. Who
        shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? — The Apostle speaks
        here of God’s elect. This reminds believers that their election is not
        to be ascribed to anything in themselves, but is to be traced solely to
        the grace and mercy of God, by whom they were chosen in Christ before
        the, foundation of the world, Ephesians 1:4. Their election demonstrates
        the vanity of all accusations that can be brought against them, either
        by their own conscience, by the world, or by Satan. Thus, while the
        Apostle removes every ground of boasting and vainglory, and all
        presumptuous thoughts of themselves, of their freewill and
        self-righteousness, he lays the sure foundation of joy and peace in
        believing. He leads us to the election of God as the source of all the
        good we enjoy or hope for, in order to set aside every ground for
        vainglory, and all presumption as to any worthiness in ourselves of our
        own will or righteousness, so that we may fully recognize the grace and
        mercy of God to us, who, even when we did not exist, chose us for
        Himself, according to His own good pleasure, Ephesians 1:4,5. He
        likewise does so that we may have a sure foundation to rest on, even
        God’s eternal and unchangeable purpose, instead of any fallacious hope
        from reliance on anything in ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it is said here, ‘Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s
        elect?’ it does not refer to men generally, but to believers as the
        elect of God. The word elect must be taken in this place in its
        connection with called, as in the preceding verses, since it is here
        found connected with justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a man might be elected, and yet not be for the present justified, as
        Paul, when he persecuted the Church, who was not justified till he
        actually believed, though even then elected, and, according to God’s
        purpose and counsel, ordained to salvation. It is God that justifeth. —
        This is the first thing which the Apostle opposes to the accusations
        that might be brought against the elect of God:
      </p>
      <p>
        God justifies them. There is none that justifies besides God. None can
        absolve and acquit a sinner from guilt, and constitute and pronounce him
        righteous, but God alone! ‘I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy
        transgressions for Mine own sake,’ Isaiah 43:25; for it is God alone
        against whom sin is committed, in reference to future condemnation.
        ‘Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned,’ Psalm 51:4. It is God alone
        that condemns, and therefore it is God alone that justifies. If, then,
        God has made believers just or righteous, who is he that will bring them
        in guilty? There are here two grounds upon which the Apostle founds the
        justification of believers. One is taken from its Author — it is God
        that justifies; the other is taken from the subjects of this privilege —
        they are the elect. And thus the freeness of justification, and its
        permanency, are both certified.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here established that the elect are saved in such a way that
        nothing can be laid to their charge. All their debt, then, must be paid,
        and all their sins must be atoned for. If full compensation has not been
        made, something might be laid to their charge. This shows that salvation
        is by justice, as well as by mercy, and gives a view of salvation that
        never would have entered into the heart of man. Nay, it is so far from
        human view, that even after it is revealed, it still lies hid from all
        the world, except from those who are taught of God. And some, even of
        them, being slow of heart to believe, are but partially enlightened in
        this glorious view of the salvation of the guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 34. — Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea
        rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
        also maketh intercession for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who is he that condemneth? — In the preceding verse it is asked, Who
        shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? here it is demanded,
        Who shall condemn them? They who cannot be accused cannot be condemned.
      </p>
      <p>
        God Himself is pleased to justify the elect, to deliver them from
        condemnation, and views them as possessing perfect righteousness; and
        being in this justified state by the judicial sentence of God, who shall
        dare to condemn them? None can discover a single sin of which to accuse
        them as still subjecting them to the curse of the law, and to bring them
        into that condemnation, from which they have been delivered by what God
        Himself hath done for them. It is here supposed that their condemnation
        is impossible, because it would be unjust. In similar language, the Lord
        Jesus Christ, the first elect of God, speaking by the Prophet Isaiah,
        50:8, says, ‘He is near that justifieth Me; who will contend with Me?’
        These words relate to His confidence in His Heavenly Father, who would
        uphold Him as His righteous servant; and it is on His righteousness and
        work that the acquittal of all those whom the Father hath given Him, and
        who are elected in Him, is rested. The Apostle having said that it is
        God that justifieth them, next proceeds to give the reasons of their
        freedom from condemnation. Four grounds are here stated: — 1st ,
        Christ’s death; 2nd , His resurrection; 3rd , His enthronement at the
        right hand of God; and, 4th , His intercession. It is Christ that died.
        — By His death, the penalty of the holy law, on account of its violation
        by His people, was executed, and satisfaction made to Divine justice. In
        answer to the question, Who is he that condemneth? the Apostle replies
        that Christ died. By this he intimates the impossibility of our being
        absolved from sin, without satisfaction for the injury done to the
        rights of God’s justice and the sacred majesty of His eternal laws which
        had been violated; for the just God could not set aside His justice by
        His mercy, and justify sinners without an atonement. It is on this
        account that God had instituted sacrifices under the law, to hold forth
        the necessity of a satisfaction, and to prove that without shedding of
        blood there could be no remission of sin. There is, then, a manifest
        necessity of repairing the outrage against the perfections of God, which
        are the original and fundamental rule of the duty of the creature. This
        reparation could only be made by a satisfaction that should correspond
        with the august majesty of the holiness of God; and consequently it must
        be of infinite value, which could only be found in a person of infinite
        dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the death of Jesus Christ as the atonement for sin, our eyes are
        constantly directed throughout the Scriptures, whether by types, by
        prophecies, or by historical descriptions of the event. Death was the
        punishment threatened in the covenant of works against sin. But Jesus
        Christ had neither transgressed that covenant, nor could participate in
        the imputation of the sin of Adam, because He sprang not from him by the
        way of natural generation. Being, therefore, without sin, either actual
        or imputed, the penalty of death could not be incurred on His own
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Death, then, which is the wages of sin, must have been suffered by Him
        for sinners. Their iniquities were laid on Him, and by His stripes they
        are healed. His death, therefore, utterly forbids the condemnation of
        the elect of God, who were given to Him, and are one with Him, of whom
        only the context speaks. It must be a just and full compensation for
        their sins. It is evidently implied that none for whom He died can be
        condemned. For if condemnation be forbidden by His death, then that
        condemnation must be prohibited with respect to all for whom He died.
        His death made satisfaction to justice for them, and therefore, in their
        case, both accusation and condemnation are rendered impossible. Yea
        rather, that is risen again. — This is the second ground affirmed by the
        Apostle against the possibility of the condemnation of God’s elect.
      </p>
      <p>
        What purpose would the death of Christ have served, if He had been
        overcome and swallowed up by it? ‘If Christ be not raised, your faith is
        vain; ye are yet in your sins.’ If He be not risen, it must be because
        He had not expiated those sins for which He died, and was therefore
        retained a prisoner by death. But since the Surety has been released
        from the grave, complete satisfaction must have been made; for if but
        one sin which had been laid upon Him had continued unatoned for, He
        would have remained for ever in the grave, death being the wages of sin.
        But now, since He has risen from the grave, the obligation against His
        people must be effaced and entirely abolished, His resurrection being
        their resurrection, Colossians 2:12. It is on this account that the
        Apostle here opposes to condemnation not only the death of Christ, but
        also His resurrection, as something higher, and as being our full
        absolution. And, by the commandment of Jesus Christ, the Gospel was not
        announced to the Gentiles, nor spread through the world, till after His
        resurrection, as He Himself said, Luke 24:46: ‘It behooved Christ to
        suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, that repentance and
        remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrection, then, of Christ, is the proof of His victory, and of
        the entire expiation of His people’s sins. It is therefore opposed to
        their condemnation, as being the evidence and completion of their
        absolution and acquittal; for as the death of Jesus Christ was His
        condemnation, and that of all united to Him, so His resurrection is His
        absolution and also theirs. As the Father, by delivering Him to death,
        condemned their sins in Him, so, in raising Him from the dead, he
        pronounced their acquittal from all the sins that had been laid upon
        Him. This is what the Apostle teaches respecting the justification of
        Jesus Christ. He was justified by the Spirit, 1 Timothy 3:16; that is,
        declared and recognized to be righteous; and with regard to His people’s
        justification in Him, that as He had died for their sins, so He was
        raised for their justification. The resurrection of Jesus Christ was a
        manifestation of His Godhead and Divine power. He was declared to be the
        Son of God, and consequently possessing over all things absolute power
        and dominion. ‘For to this end Christ both died and rose, and revived,
        that He might be Lord both of the dead and living.’ Who is even at the
        right hand of God. — This is the third ground on which the security of
        God’s elect is rested. Jesus Christ sits at God’s right hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a figurative expression taken from the custom of earthly
        monarchs, to express special favor, and denotes, with respect to Christ,
        both dignity and power. ‘When He had by Himself purged our sins, He sat
        down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.’ Having finished the work
        of redemption, this was the result of His labors, and the testimony of
        its consummation. His thus sitting down indicates an essential
        difference between our Lord Jesus Christ and the Levitical priests.
        ‘Every priest standeth daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the
        same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this Man, after He
        had offered one sacrifice for sin, for ever sat down on the right hand
        of God.’ The Levitical priests had never finished their work: it was
        still imperfect. They stood, therefore, ministering daily, in token of
        continued service. But Christ having offered one sacrifice for sins, by
        which He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified, for ever sat
        down on the right hand of God, Hebrews 10:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, then, is not only raised from the dead, but has also
        ascended into heaven, and is possessed of all power and glory, and is
        there to defend His people. His seat at the right hand of God signifies
        His permanent exaltation as Mediator, and His communion with God in
        sovereign power and authority, reigning as the Head and King of His
        Church. The amount of the Apostles reasoning is, that such being the
        condition of Him who was dead and is risen again, possessed of the keys
        of hell and of death, who shall dare to appear before Him to bring an
        accusation against His members or to condemn the elect of God? Who also
        maketh intercession for us. — This is the fourth and last ground of the
        security of God’s elect. The intercession of Jesus Christ is the second
        act of His priesthood, and is a necessary consequence of His sacrifice,
        which is the first act, and precedes the third, namely, His coming forth
        from the heavenly sanctuary to bless those whom He has redeemed to God
        by His blood. His intercession consists in that perpetual application
        which He makes to His Father; in the name of His Church, of the blood
        which He shed on the cross for the salvation of His people, in order to
        obtain for them the fruits of that oblation. It was necessary that His
        sacrifice should be offered upon earth, because it was an act of His
        humiliation; but His intercession which supposes the establishment of
        righteousness and peace, is made in heaven, being an act of His
        exaltation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This intercession was figuratively represented by the high priest in
        Israel, when, after having offered in his linen garments the sacrifice,
        without the precincts of the holy place, he took the blood of the
        victim, and, clothed in his sacerdotal golden robes, entered alone into
        the most holy place, and sprinkled the blood on and before the
        mercy-seat. Jesus Christ, then, who suffered without the gate, Hebrews
        13:12, in accomplishing the truth of this figure, first offered upon
        earth His sacrifice, and afterwards entered in His glory into heaven, to
        present to His Father the infinite price of His oblation by the mystical
        sprinkling of His blood. This is not to be understood as being any
        bodily humiliation, as bowing the knee before God, but it is the
        presenting of His blood of perpetual efficacy. It is the voice of that
        blood which speaketh better things than the blood of Abel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blood of Jesus Christ being the blood of the everlasting covenant —
        that blood which was to reunite God with men, and men with God — it was
        necessary, after its being shed on the cross, that it should be thus
        sprinkled in heaven. ‘I go,’ says He to His disciples, ‘to prepare a
        place for you.’ It was necessary that this blood should be sprinkled
        there, and also upon them, before they could be admitted. But by its
        means they were prepared to enter into heaven, and heaven itself was
        prepared for their reception, which without that sprinkling would have
        been defiled by their presence. ‘Neither by the blood of goats and
        calves, but by His own blood, He entered in once into the holy place,
        having obtained eternal redemption.’ Jesus Christ is not only seated at
        the right hand of God, but He is there for the very purpose of
        interceding for His people. By the perpetual efficacy of His blood their
        sins are removed, and consequently every ground of their condemnation.
        This never-ceasing intercession of Him who ever liveth to advocate their
        cause, not only procures the remission of their sins, but also all the
        graces of the Holy Spirit; and by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit an
        internal aspersion is made upon their hearts when they are actually
        converted to God, and when by faith they receive the sprinkling of the
        blood of their Redeemer. For them He died, He rose, He ascended to
        heaven, and there intercedes. How, then, can they be condemned? How can
        they come short of eternal glory?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 35. — Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
        tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
        peril, or sword?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the contemplation of those glorious truths and Divine consolations
        which the Apostle had been unfolding, he had demanded, Who shall accuse,
        who shall condemn, the elect of God? he here triumphantly asks, Who
        shall separate them from the love of Christ? Having pointed out the
        grounds on which the fears of behaviors from within are relieved, he now
        fortifies them against fears from without. This order is the more
        proper, since their internal fears and misgivings are more formidable
        than their outward trials, and the hatred and opposition of the world;
        and until the believer, as has been observed, has overcome the former by
        having the answer of a good conscience towards God, he is not prepared
        to withstand the latter. Although the people of God are exposed to all
        the evils here enumerated, these shall not prevail to separate him from
        the love of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term the love of Christ, in itself, may signify either our love to
        Christ, or Christ’s love to us; but that it is Christ’s love to us in
        this place there can be no question. A person could not be said to be
        separated from his own feelings. Besides, the object of the Apostle is
        to assure us not so immediately of our love to God, as of His love to
        us, by directing our attention to His predestining, calling, justifying,
        and glorifying us, and not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up
        for us. In addition to this, it contributes more to our consolation to
        have our minds fixed upon God’s love to us than upon our love to God;
        for, as our love is subject to many failings and infirmities, and as we
        are liable to change, to endeavor to impart consolation from the
        firmness of our love, would be less efficacious than holding forth to us
        the love of God, in whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of
        change. The language, too, employed, favors this sense; for the Apostle
        does not say, ‘Who shall separate Christ from our love?’ but, ‘Who shall
        separate us from the love of Christ?’ and, in the 37th verse, the
        meaning is determined by the expression, ‘We are more than conquerors
        through Him that loved us. ’ God, however, in loving His children, makes
        them love Him; and believers are enabled to love Christ because He loves
        them. It is He who first loved us, and in loving us has changed our
        hearts, and produced in them love to Him. Paul prays that believers,
        ‘being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all
        saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to
        know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that they may be
        filled with all the fullness of God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        To have a just idea of the love of Christ, we must contemplate its
        duration. It was from before the foundation of the world — from all
        eternity. We must consider that He who has loved us is the high and
        lofty One who inhabiteth eternity, who dwelleth in light that is
        inaccessible; before whom the angels veil their faces, crying, ‘Holy,
        holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts;’ and before whom the inhabitants of the
        earth are as grasshoppers, and the nations as a drop of a bucket. We
        must remember, too, who we are, who are the objects of His love, — not
        only creatures who are but dust and ashes, dwelling in houses of clay,
        but who were His enemies, and by nature children of wrath. We must also
        reflect on the greatness of His love, that it is His will we should be
        one with Him, and that He guards us as the apple of His eye. He loves
        His people as His members, of whom He is the Head, and sympathizes with
        them when they suffer. He calls their sufferings His sufferings, and
        their persecutions His persecutions, as He said to Saul persecuting His
        members, ‘Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?’ He will also say to
        those on His right hand in the day of judgment that He hungered, and
        thirsted, and was naked, and that they gave Him to eat and drink, and
        clothed Him, when these things were done to the least of His members. He
        loves His people, too, as being their Husband, by that spiritual
        marriage He has contracted with them, as it is said, ‘Husbands, love
        your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for
        it.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The love here spoken of as the security of believers being the love of
        Christ, Christ must be God. Were Christ not God, we might come short of
        heaven without being separated from His love. He might love, and yet not
        be able to save the objects of His love.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is likewise to be remarked, that the confidence of believers that
        they shall not be separated from the love of Christ, is not founded on
        their high opinion of themselves, or on their own ability to remain firm
        against temptations, but is grounded on Christ’s love, and His ability
        to preserve and uphold them. As nothing can be laid to their charge — as
        none can condemn them — as all things that happen to them, instead of
        proving injurious, work together for their good, — it is impossible that
        they can be finally lost. If Christ so love them, what shall separate
        them from that love?
      </p>
      <p>
        In specifying those evils which in appearance are calculated to separate
        the believer from the love of Christ, the Apostle points out the
        sufferings of the people of God, the time of these sufferings — all the
        day long; the manner — as sheep for the slaughter; the cause — for Thy
        sake. He distinguishes the seven evils that follow: — 1st , Tribulation.
        — This is placed first, as being a general term, comprehending all the
        particulars which he afterwards enumerates. It means affliction in
        general. It refers not only to the general state of suffering which,
        when man had sinned, it was pronounced should be his lot — ’In sorrow
        shalt thou eat of it (of the produce of the ground) all the days of thy
        life’ — but also more particularly to the tribulation which the
        disciples of Christ shall all more or less experience. ‘In the world ye
        shall have tribulation,’ John 16:33. The tribulation of unbelievers is
        the effect of the wrath of God; but the afflictions of His people are
        salutary corrections, which, so far from separating them from His love,
        yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and are for their profit,
        that they might not be condemned with the world, but be partakers of His
        holiness. ‘As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.’
      </p>
      <p>
        To tribulation is added, 2nd , Distress, which signifies straits,
        difficulties, critical situations. It means the perplexity in which we
        are, when, under pressure or trouble, we see no way of deliverance, and
        no way to escape presents itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word denotes a narrow place, in which we are so much pressed or
        straitened that we know not where to go or turn; which expresses the
        condition of the believer when he is not only oppressed, but reduced to
        extremity. ‘Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress,’ Psalm 4:1.
        3rd , Persecution is affliction for the profession of the Gospel. The
        persecuted have often been pursued and constrained to flee from place to
        place, as the Lord Jesus was carried into Egypt when Herod sought to
        kill Him. ‘If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you.’
        But so far is persecution from separating believers from the love of
        Christ, that ‘Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’
        sake.’ 4th , Famine. — To this the persecuted are frequently subjected,
        though they may have been rich and powerful. 5th , Nakedness. — The
        disciples have often been reduced to indigence and poverty, stripped by
        their enemies, and obliged to wander naked in deserts, and to hide
        themselves, like wild beasts, in caves of the earth, Hebrews 11:38. Paul
        himself was frequently exercised with hunger, and thirst, and fastings,
        and cold, and nakedness. 6th , Peril. — This refers to the dangers to
        which the Lord’s people are exposed. These, at some times, and in some
        countries, are exceedingly many and great; and at all times, and in all
        countries, are more or less numerous and trying. If God were not their
        protector, even in this land of freedom, the followers of the Lamb would
        be cut off or injured. It is the Lord’s providence that averts such
        injuries, or overrules events for the protection of His people. This is
        too little considered even by themselves, and would be thought a most
        unfounded calumny or fanatical idea by the world. But let the Christian
        habitually consider his safety and protection as secured by the Lord,
        rather than by the liberality of the times. That time never yet was when
        the Lord’s people could be safe, if circumstances removed restraint from
        the wicked. Those who boast of their unbounded liberality would, if in
        situations calculated to develop their natural hatred of the truth,
        prove, after all, bitter persecutors. f44 7th , Sword. — This means
        violence carried to the utmost extremity. It is persecution which stops
        not with smaller injuries but inflicts even death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 36. — As it is written, For Thy sake we are killed all the day
        long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is written. — To the enumeration of evils presented in the
        foregoing verse, the Apostle here adds the testimony of the Scriptures,
        by which he verifies what is declared in the fifteenth chapter. ‘For
        whatever things were written afore time, were written for our learning
        that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.’
        And to what purpose would, it be to appeal to the afflictions of the
        Church under the former dispensation, were it not to lead us to patience
        under the Gospel?
      </p>
      <p>
        For if believers in that period bore their trials with patience, how
        much more should we do so when God now clearly reveals His saving grace,
        and not as formerly in figures and shadowed. In this manner the Lord and
        His Apostles frequently appeal to the Old Testament Scriptures, by which
        they testify to them as the word of God, and also show the agreement
        between the Old Testament and the New. The reference, then, is not
        intended to state a similar fact in similar language, by way of what is
        called accommodation, according to the interpretation of Mr. Stuart, Mr.
        Tholuck, and others. A greater indignity to the Scriptures, and the
        Spirit of God, by whom they were dictated, cannot be offered, than to
        assert that passages of the Old Testament, which are quoted by the
        Apostles as predictions, are only an accommodation of words. This would
        not merely be silly, but heinously criminal. It is not only irreverent
        to suppose that the Apostles, in order to enforce the truth of what they
        were teaching, would quote the language of the Spirit in a meaning which
        the Holy Spirit did not intend to convey, but it is a charge of palpable
        falsehood and dishonesty against the writers of the New Testament, as
        calling that a fulfillment which is not a fulfillment, and appealing to
        the Old Testament declarations as confirmatory of their own doctrine,
        when they were aware that it was merely a fanciful accommodation of
        words, and that they were deluding their readers. Are practices to be
        admitted, in explanation of the word of God, which are never tolerated
        on other subjects, and which, if detected, would cover their authors
        with disgrace?
      </p>
      <p>
        The quotation here shows that this passage in the Psalm, to which the
        reference is made, was in its fullest sense a prediction, and this
        regards the fulfillment. It was indeed a historical fact, and verified
        with respect to the Jews. But this fact, instead of proving it not to be
        prophetical and typical, is the very circumstance that fits it for that
        purpose. ‘The quotation here,’ says Professor Stuart, ‘comes from Psalm
        44:22 [Septuagint 43:22], and is applied to the state of Christians in
        the Apostle’s times, as it was originally to those whom the Psalmist
        describes; in other words, the Apostle describes the state of suffering
        Christians, by the terms which were employed in ancient days to describe
        the suffering people of God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        What could be more degrading to the book of God than the supposition
        that the Apostles ever quoted the Scriptures in this manner, by way of
        accommodation? How does this hide the glory of the perfection of the Old
        Testament, as in figure it exhibits Christ and His Church! For Thy sake.
        — It was for God’s sake that the Jews were hated and persecuted by the
        other nations, because, according to the commandment of God, they
        separated themselves from them in all their worship. They could have not
        religious fellowship with them, and on that account they were regarded
        as enemies to the rest of mankind. In like manner, when Christianity
        appeared, preferring a solemn charge of falsehood against all other
        religions in the world, Christians were accused of hating all mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the grand accusation against them in primitive times by the
        heathens, and even by such historians as the so-called philosophic
        Tacitus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians, in the same way, are still hated by the world, because they
        profess that salvation is only through the blood of Christ. As this
        implies that all who do not hold that doctrine are in error and
        ignorance, and under condemnation, it excites in the strongest manner
        the enmity of the world.

      <p>
        But the cause of this hatred must be traced to a principle still deeper,
        even the enmity of the carnal mind against God, and against His image in
        man, wherever it is seen. It is the working of that enmity which God put
        at the beginning between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the
        woman, Genesis 3:15 The afflictions and trials of the people of God are
        here referred to, to induce believers to exercise patience, to teach
        them not to promise themselves exemption from the treatment experienced
        by those who formerly lived under the covenant of God, but rather to
        remember that, if sometimes spared, it is owing to the forbearance and
        mercy of God. They are appealed to in order to lead them to consider the
        goodness of God in former times, as exhibited in the issues of the
        afflictions with which He visited His people, not to separate them from
        His love, but to do them good in the latter end. ‘Ye have heard of the
        patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
        very pitiful, and of tender mercy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        How much consolation and joy should Christians experience in suffering
        affliction of any description whatever, when they can appeal to their
        Lord and Savior, and say, It is for ‘Thy sake,’ Matthew 5:11. So far
        from being separated from the love of Christ by such sufferings, they
        are by them made more conformable to His image. In suffering for evil,
        men are conformable to the image of the first Adam. We are killed. — In
        speaking of those sufferings, which shall not separate believers from
        God, the Apostle here refers to death, the highest point to which they
        can be carried. As to the time, he speaks of it as ‘all the day long;’
        that is, they are constantly exposed to the greatest measure of
        suffering in this life, and are frequently exercised with it. As to the
        manner, he says, We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. — The
        enemies of the people of God have often given them up to death with as
        little reluctance as sheep are driven to the slaughter. There is pity
        even for the murderer on the scaffold, but for Christ and His people
        there is none. The cry still is against the servants, as it was against
        the Master, ‘Crucify, crucify.’ Even in death they find no sympathy.
        This is attested by history in every age and country; witness the
        repeated and dreadful persecutions of Christians during the first three
        centuries, when they were treated not like men but as wild beasts, and
        the cry of the multitude was, ‘The Christians to the lions.’ When there
        is a respite from persecution, it is through the kind providence of God,
        when He restrains the malice of him who was a murderer from the
        beginning, and the evil passions of men, who are the willing instruments
        of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 37. — Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through
        Him that loved us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sufferings of believers above enumerated, which, as the Apostle had
        just shown, verify the truth of the ancient predictions of the word of
        God, shall not separate them from the love of Christ, but, on the
        contrary, are to them the sources of the greatest benefits. Through them
        they are more than conquerors. — This is a strong expression, but in its
        fullest import it is strictly true. The Christian not only overcomes in
        the worst of his trials, but more than overcomes his adversaries, and
        all those things which seem to be against him. It is possible to
        overcome, and yet obtain no advantage from The contest, nay, to find the
        victory a loss. But the Christian not only vanquishes, he is also a
        gainer by the assault of his enemy. It is better for him than if he had
        not been called to suffer. He is a gainer and a conqueror, both in the
        immediate fruits of his sufferings, as God overrules them for his good,
        bringing him forth from the furnace as gold refined, and also in their
        final issue; for ‘our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
        worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.’ The
        term conquerors reminds us that the life of a believer is a warfare, in
        which he is called to combat, both within and without. We may remark,
        too, the difference between the judgment of God, and the judgment of
        men, respecting the victory of believers. In the world, persecutors and
        oppressors are judged as the conquerors; but here, those are pronounced
        to be such, who are oppressed and persecuted. They are the servants of
        Him whom the world put to death, but who said to His disciples, ‘Be of
        good cheer, I have overcome the world.’ Through Him that loved us. — The
        Apostle says that we are more than conquerors, not through Him that
        loves us, but through Him that loved us, — using the past time, thus
        directing our attention to Christ dying for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        His love to us is the character by which Christ is often described, as
        if it were that by which He should be best known to us, and as if, in
        comparison, there was none but He alone who loved us. ‘Who loved me,’
        says the Apostle, ‘and gave Himself for me.’ ‘Who loved us, and washed
        us from our sins in His own blood.’ ‘Christ also loved the Church, and
        gave Himself for it.’ This expression shows that the confidence spoken
        of in this place is a confidence wholly grounded on Christ’s love and
        power, and not on our own firmness. It is not by our own loyalty and
        resolution, but through Him that loved us, that we are more than
        conquerors. In the Apostle Peter we see the weakness of all human
        affection and resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the glory, then, of this victory which we obtain is to be ascribed
        solely to God; for it is He who is at our right hand, and who supports
        us in all our afflictions. In the seventeenth chapter of the Book of
        Revelation, the Lamb, who is Jesus Christ, is represented as combating
        against the enemies of His Church. He is our shield, our rock, and our
        refuge. It is declared that we are ‘kept (as in a garrison) by the power
        of God,’ Peter 1:5, in order that we may not presume on our own
        strength, or attribute to ourselves the glory of our preservation; but
        that we may keep our eyes fixed upon Him who, with His outstretched arm,
        conducts us to the heavenly Canaan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 38. — Far I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
        nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verses Paul had proclaimed the triumph of believers
        over everything within and without them, that seemed to endanger their
        security. He had spoken of tribulation, and distress, and persecutions,
        and famine, and nakedness, and peril, and sword, over all of which he
        had pronounced them more than conquerors. He now proceeds, in the same
        triumphant language, to defy enemies still more formidable; asserting
        that all the conceivable powers of the universe shall not be able to
        separate them from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ. For I am
        persuaded — Here Paul introduces his own persuasion of the love of God
        to His people, that in so doing others may imitate him. This appears
        more fully in the next verse, by his making the constancy of God’s love
        a privilege not peculiar to himself, but common to all His people. He
        sets before believers this persuasion, to confirm them in the conviction
        that they need not fear the want of God’s support to enable them to
        overcome all trials, and surmount all dangers. For this persuasion is
        not conjectural, but an assured confidence, such as he expresses when he
        says, ‘I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to
        keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day,’ Timothy
        1:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we see the nature and quality of faith as opposed to the doctrine
        of the Church of Rome, which holds it to be merely a general belief of
        all that God has said, without confidence in His promises, or assurance
        of His grace. But the object of the Gospel, which is called ‘the Gospel
        of peace,’ is, that those who have fled for refuge to the hope set
        before them, should have strong consolation, Hebrews 6:18, and peace in
        their conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The words, ‘I am persuaded,’ used by the Apostle, about that faith is a
        persuasion, and a union and conformity of heart to the word which we
        believe. Our reception of the promises, then, is a special application
        of them, when we take home to ourselves the grace and love of God, as
        the Apostle does when he says, verse 39, that nothing shall be able to
        separate us, to prove that he speaks in the name of all believers, and
        that, in this triumph of faith, he employs language common to them all.
        The objection that the language he used was appropriate only to
        Apostles, would set aside his intention and object altogether. The
        Church of Rome, however, objects, that in order to this application of
        faith, the Gospel should speak to each individual by his name, and say,
        ‘Thou art saved, thou art pardoned.’ But if, as they admit, the law, by
        its general propositions, obliges every one to obey it, while it names
        no person individually, and in saying, ‘Cursed is every one who
        continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
        do them,’ condemns every man who does not yield obedience to its
        commands, why should they deny that the propositions of the Gospel
        comprise every believer in particular, or affirm that in saying, ‘He
        that believeth in Jesus hath eternal life,’ it does not speak to all who
        believe in Jesus, and declare that each one of them hath eternal life?
        When the law says, ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ ‘Thou shalt not steal,’ ought
        any one to doubt that these commandments are addressed to him? But, in
        the Gospel, we find the same manner of speaking. ‘If thou shalt confess
        with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God
        hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.’ Every believer,
        then, should rejoice in the declarations and promises of the Gospel, as
        if they were addressed to him by name. That neither death. — Death
        itself shall not separate believers from the love of God, nor should
        they question His love because He has appointed that they should die
        once. Death, with all its accompaniments, which are always solemn and
        sometimes terrible, may wear the semblance of God’s displeasure. But,
        notwithstanding the pains and sufferings by which it is usually
        preceded, especially when inflicted by persecution, to which there may
        be here a particular allusion, — notwithstanding the humiliating
        dissolution of the body into dust, — yet God is with His children when
        they walk through this dark valley, and ‘precious in the sight of the
        Lord is the death of His saints.’ In their death they have fellowship
        with Him who has disarmed it of its sting, and destroyed him that had
        the power of death. So far from separating them from God, it is His
        messenger to bring them home to Himself. If its aspect be terrible, it
        is still like the brazen serpent in the wilderness, which had but the
        form of a serpent, without its deadly poison. It dissolves the earthly
        house of their tabernacle, but introduces them into their house not made
        with hands, eternal in the heavens. It discharges the soul from the
        burden of sin, that it may be clothed with perfect holiness; for death,
        although the effect of sin, is the occasion of slaying and destroying it
        in the believer. Nor life. — This is the next thing that the Apostle
        enumerates as threatening to separate believers from the love of God. It
        includes all the dangers and difficulties they have to encounter while
        passing through this world, and carrying about with them a body of sin
        and death amidst the various temptations from prosperity or adversity to
        which they are exposed. Yet Christ is their shepherd, and the Holy
        Spirit their leader. So far from separating them from the love of God,
        life as well as death are included among the privileges which belong to
        the children of God, Corinthians 3:22.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor angels. — Some restrict this to good angels, and some to evil
        angels.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no reason why it should not include both. Mr. Stuart asks, How
        can the good angels, ‘who are sent forth to minister to such as are
        heirs of salvation ( Hebrews 1:14), be well supposed to be opposers and
        enemies of Christians?’ But how could Mr. Stuart pronounce such a
        judgment in the face of the Apostle himself on another occasion/ If ‘an
        angel from heaven preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we
        have preached unto you, let him be accursed.’ Could an angel from heaven
        be supposed a false preacher rather than a persecutor? But such
        suppositions are common in Scripture. They do not imply the possibility
        of the things supposed; and it fully justifies them, if the consequence
        would follow from the supposition, were it realized. By the expression,
        ‘nor height, nor depth,’ Mr. Stuart understands is meant neither heaven
        nor hell. Did he not observe, then, that this is inconsistent with his
        objection to explaining the term principalities and powers as referring
        to heavenly angels? If height means heaven, surely it is the inhabitants
        of the place who are meant, not the place itself. Nor principalities,
        nor powers. — This is also variously interpreted. Some confine it to
        angels, and some to civil rulers. There is no reason that it should not
        extend to the words in their widest meaning. It is true of civil powers;
        it is equally true of all angelic powers. It is as true with respect to
        principalities in heaven, as it is with respect to those in hell. Were
        all the principalities, through all creation, to use their power against
        Christians, it would not succeed. They have Christ on their side; who,
        then, can prevail against them? This justifies strong expressions in the
        exhibition of Divine truth. We are warranted by this to illustrate
        Scripture doctrine from the supposition of things impossible, in order
        the more deeply to impress the human mind with the truth inculcated.
        This fact is of great importance as to the explanation of Scripture. Nor
        things present, nor things to come. — Neither the trials nor afflictions
        in which the children of God are at any time involved, nor with which
        they may at any future period be exercised, will avail to separate them
        from Christ. There is nothing that can happen against which the
        providence of God does not secure them. What dangers should they dread
        when He says, ‘Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will
        help thee, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel’
        ‘When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
        the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the
        fire, thou shalt not be burnt; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
        For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior.’ Nothing
        does happen, nothing can happen, which, from eternity, He hath not
        appointed and foreseen, and over which He hath not complete control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 39. — Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
        to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor height, nor depth. — These expressions appear to comprise all that
        had been said of angels, principalities, and powers, including them
        altogether to give greater force to the declaration concerning them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wherever they were, or whatever other power might inhabit heaven above,
        or hell beneath, if either a part of them, or the whole in combination,
        were to assail those whom Jesus loves, it would be of no avail. A
        reference may also be made to the highest state of prosperity to which a
        man may be elevated, or the lowest degree of adversity to which he may
        be depressed — of honor or of reproach. Neither the situation of Solomon
        the king, amidst the splendors of royalty, nor that of Lazarus the
        beggar, clothed in rags and covered with sores, although both are
        dangerous in the extreme, shall separate the believer from the love of
        God. Nor any other Creature. — The Apostle here, in conclusion of his
        discourse, after his long enumeration, intending to accumulate into one
        word all possible created existence in the whole universe, adds this
        expression, which completes the climax. Any other creature, that is, any
        creature which at present or hereafter should exist, all being created
        by and for Jesus Christ, and subordinate to His power, — no such
        creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in
        Him. From all the evils above enumerated God has delivered His people,
        not that they should not suffer them, but that they should not be
        overcome by them. The love of God. — Here what was before called the
        love of Christ is called the love of God. Could such a variety of
        expressions be used if Christ were not God as well as the Father? Among
        all the uncertainties of this life, that which is certain and can never
        fail, is the love of God to His children. On this ground, Job, when
        deprived of all his earthly possessions, exclaims, ‘Though He slay me,
        yet will I trust in Him,’ Job 13:15. ‘My flesh and my heart faileth, but
        God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever,’ Psalm 73:26.
        In Christ Jesus our Lord. — The love of God is here declared to be in
        Christ Jesus, to show that it is not God’s love in general that is here
        referred to, but that covenant love with which God loves us as His
        children, His heirs, and joint heirs with His only-begotten and
        well-beloved Son. If it were simply said that God loves us, we might
        say, in reflecting on our sins, how can God love such sinful creatures
        as we are; and how can we assure ourselves of the continuance of His
        love, since we are daily sinning, and provoking Him to anger? The
        Apostle, therefore, sets forth to us Jesus Christ, who is the same
        yesterday, and to-day, and for ever, as the medium of this love, in
        order that while we see that we are sinners and worthy of condemnation
        we may regard ourselves as in Jesus Christ, in whom we are reconciled,
        and washed from our sins in His blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is this medium to which the Apostle refers when he says, ‘He hath
        made us accepted in the Beloved,’ and God ‘hath blessed us with all
        spiritual blessings in, heavenly places in Christ; ‘He hath chosen us in
        Him before the foundation of the world,’ Ephesians 1:4. As, then, Jesus
        Christ is the true object of the love of the Father, as He testified by
        the voice from heaven, so in Him He loves His people with an everlasting
        love. To Him He had given them from eternity, and has united them to Him
        in time, that He might love them in Him, and by Him. Thus the Father
        loves no man out of the Son. As the sins of men had rendered them
        enemies to God, His justice could never have permitted them to be the
        objects of His love, if He had not expiated their sins, and washed them
        in the blood of His Son. Whoever, then, is not or shall not be in
        Christ, is not loved by the Father, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
        As the Apostle John testifies that God hath given us life, and this life
        is in His Son, so the Apostle Paul here declares that God hath given us
        His love, but that this love is in Jesus Christ. Consequently, we should
        not look for its cause in our works, or in anything in ourselves, but in
        Jesus Christ alone. Its incomprehensible extent and eternal duration are
        seen in His own words, when, addressing His Father, He says, ‘And hast
        loved them, as Thou hast loved Me;’ and again, ‘Thou lovest Me before
        the foundation of the world,’ John 17:23.
      </p>
      <p>
        The love of God, then, to His people, flows entirely through Jesus
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men in general are fond of contemplating God as a God of benevolence.
      </p>
      <p>
        They attempt to flatter Him by praising His beneficence. But God’s love
        to man is exercised only through the atonement made to His justice by
        the sacrifice of His Son. Those, therefore, who rejoice Christ and hope
        to partake of God’s love through any other means than Christ’s
        all-powerful mediation, must fail of success. There is no other name
        under heaven given among men whereby a sinner can be saved. As there was
        no protection in Egypt from death by the destroying angel except in
        those houses that were sprinkled with the blood of the paschal lamb, so
        none will be saved in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
        judgment of God, except those who are sprinkled with the blood of
        atonement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order followed by the Apostle in all this discourse is very
        remarkable.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he challenges our enemies in general, and defies them all,
        saying, ‘If God be for us, who can be against us?’ Next, he shows, in
        detail, that neither the want of anything good, nor the occurrence of
        any evil, ought to trouble us. Not the want of any good, for ‘God hath
        not spared His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how, then,
        shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?’ Not the
        occurrence of any evil, for that would be either within us or without
        us. Not within us, for the evil that is within us is sin, and as to sin,
        ‘It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that
        died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of
        God, who also maketh intercession for us.’ Not anything without us, for
        it would be either in the creatures, or in God. Not in the creatures,
        for that would be ‘tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
        or nakedness, or peril, or sword.’ But ‘in all these things we are more
        than conquerors, through Him that loved us.’ Not in God, for then there
        must be variableness and change in His love. ‘Now,’ says the Apostle, ‘I
        am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
        principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
        height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
        from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.’ On this he
        rests the believer’s peace and assurance, and with these words he
        concludes his animated and most consolatory description of the victory
        and triumph of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, indeed, may the Gospel be called the wisdom of God. It harmonizes
        things in themselves the most opposite. Is it not astonishing to find
        the man, who before had declared that there was no good thing in him,
        here challenging the whole universe to bring a charge against any of the
        elect of God? With respect to every Christian, in one point of view, it
        may be asserted that there is nothing good in him; and in another, it
        may be as confidently asserted that there is in him nothing evil. How
        could Paul say of himself, after he was a partaker of the holiness of
        the Spirit of truth, that there was nothing good in him? It was as
        concerned his own corrupt human nature. On what principle could he say,
        Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It was as they are
        in Christ Jesus. This is beautifully exhibited, 1 Corinthians 1:30. God
        hath united us to Christ Jesus in such an intimate manner, that His
        obedience is our obedience; His sufferings are our sufferings; His
        righteousness is our righteousness, for He is made unto us
        righteousness. This fully explains the ground on which we stand
        righteous before God: we stand in Christ. He has taken away all our
        sins. He who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might be made the
        righteousness of God in Him. It is of the highest importance fully to
        understand our oneness with Christ. This will give the utmost confidence
        before God, while we entertain of ourselves the lowest opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides all the other strong grounds of consolation contained in this
        chapter, it incontrovertibly establishes the doctrine of the
        perseverance of the saints, which, though clearly exhibited in so many
        other parts of Scripture, is opposed by the Church of Rome, which
        teaches that believers may finally fall from the love of God, thus
        representing that love as variable and inconstant. They make the grace
        of God to depend on the will of man for its effect; and as the will of
        man is mutable, so they believe that the grace of God is likewise
        mutable; and, having ascribed to their free will the glory of
        perseverance, they have like many who call themselves Protestants, lost
        altogether the doctrine of the perseverance of believers unto eternal
        life. Closely connected with this doctrine of perseverance, is the
        believer’s knowledge of his acceptance with God, without which that of
        final perseverance, or, more properly speaking, the certainty of
        preservation by God, could impart to him no comfort. When one of these
        doctrines is mentioned in Scriptures, the other is generally referred
        to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of them are intimately connected with the Christian’s love to God,
        his joy and peace, and with his being filled with the fruits of
        righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to the praise and glory of God.
        The enemies of this doctrine insist that it sets aside the necessity of
        attending to good works. On the contrary, it establishes them, and
        obliges us to perform them, not from servile fear, but from gratitude,
        and filial love to our Heavenly Father. God combats for us against
        principalities, and powers, and all our enemies; we ought, therefore, to
        fight under His banner. The believer combats along with God, while the
        issue of the combat and all the victory is from God, and not from the
        believer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was one great object of the apostle to hold out strong consolation to
        all who had fled for refuge, to lay hold of the hope set before them,
        and to urge them to give all diligence to the full assurance of hope. In
        exhorting to the duties of the Christian life, they proceeded on the
        ground that those to whom they wrote had the knowledge of their interest
        in the mediation of Christ, of the forgiveness of their sins through His
        love, and of the enjoyment of the love of God, to whom, by that Spirit
        of adoption which they had received, they cried, ‘Abba, Father’ and from
        all their Epistles it appears that those whom they addressed enjoyed
        this assurance. Paul accordingly exhorts the believers at Ephesus not to
        grieve the Holy Spirit of God, whereby they were soaked unto the day of
        redemption, and immediately after enjoins on them the duty of forgiving
        one another, even as God, for Christ’s sake, had forgiven them. ‘Ye were
        sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord; walk as children
        of light.’ When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shalt ye
        also appear with Him in glory; mortify, therefore, your members which
        are upon the earth,’ Colossians 3:4. The Apostle Peter exhorts those to
        whom he wrote to love one another fervently, seeing they had purified
        their souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit. And the Apostle
        John enjoins on the little children, the young men, and the fathers, not
        to love the world, because their sins were forgiven; because they had
        known Him that is from the beginning, and because they had known the
        Father. The exhortations of the Apostles are in this manner grounded on
        the knowledge that those to whom they were directed were supposed to
        have of their interest in the Savior. Without this, the motives on which
        they are pressed to obedience would be unavailing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole strain of the apostolic Epistles is calculated to confirm this
        knowledge, which is referred to as the spring of that joy unspeakable
        and full of glory with which those who were addressed rejoiced, 1 Peter
        1:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their faith, then, must have been an appropriating faith, taking home to
        themselves individually, according to its measure, the promises of
        mercy, and enabling them to say each for himself, with the Apostle, ‘I
        am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I have; yet not I, but Christ
        liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the
        faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.’ No
        believer, without this persuasion that Christ gave Himself for him, and
        that he is ‘dead unto sin,’ and ‘alive unto God,’ should rest satisfied.
        If, in opposition to this, it be said that assurance of our interest in
        Christ is a gift of God, which He bestows as He sees good, it should be
        recollected that so also are all spiritual blessings; and if of these it
        is our duty diligently to seek for a continual supply and increase, it
        is our duty to seek for this personal assurance among the rest. It is
        glorifying to Christ our Savior, and highly important to ourselves. This
        assurance is what we are commanded to aim at, and to give all diligence
        to attain; and full provision is made for it in the Gospel, Hebrews
        6:11-20; 2 Peter 1:10. We enjoy this assurance of our salvation, when we
        are walking with God, and in proportion as we walk with Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full assurance of faith, in which believers are commanded to draw
        near to God, stands inseparably connected with having their hearts
        sprinkled from an evil conscience. An evil conscience accuses a man as
        guilty, as deserving: and liable to punishment, and keeps him at a
        distance from God.
      </p>
      <p>
        It causes him to regard the Almighty as an enemy and avenger, so that
        the natural enmity of the mind against God is excited and strengthened.
        On the contrary, a good conscience is a conscience discharged from
        guilt, by the blood of Christ. Conscience tells a man that the wages of
        sin is death, and that he has incurred the penalty; but when the
        atonement made by Christ is believed in, it is seen that our sins are no
        more ours, but Christ’s, upon whom God hath laid them all, and that the
        punishment due for sin, which is death, has been inflicted upon Him; the
        demands of the law have been fulfilled, and its penalty suffered. On
        this the believer rests, and his conscience is satisfied. It is thus
        purged from dead works, and this is what is called the answer of a good
        conscience toward God, 1 Peter 3:21. This answer of a good conscience
        cannot be disjoined from assurance of our acceptance with Him to whom we
        draw near; and the degree in which both this assurance, and a good
        conscience, are enjoyed, will be equal. As far, then, as the duty of a
        Christian’s possessing this assurance is denied, so far the duty of
        having the answer of a good conscience is not admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same also is true respecting the grace of hope. Hope is the anchor
        of the soul, to the attainment of the full assurance of which believers
        are commanded to give all diligence, and they are encouraged to hold
        fast the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. It is when they have
        the hope of beholding Jesus as He is that they purify themselves even as
        He is pure, 1 John 3:3. The ‘hope of salvation’ covers their heads in
        the combat in which they are engaged, which they are therefore commanded
        to put on, and wear as an helmet, 1 Thessalonians 5:8. In writing to the
        Thessalonians, the Apostle ascribes to God and the Lord Jesus Christ the
        everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace, which had been
        given to them. And he prays for the believers at Rome that the God of
        hope may fill them with all joy and peace in believing, and that they
        might abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        This good hope through grace, then, as well as a conscience purged from
        dead works — the duty of possessing which no Christian will deny — stand
        inseparably connected with the personal assurance of an interest in the
        Savior, and all of them lie at the foundation of love to God, and
        consequently of acceptable obedience to Him. We love Him when we see
        that He hath loved us, and that His Son is the propitiation for our
        sins. ‘Thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes, and I have walked in Thy
        truth,’ Psalm 26:3. ‘Lord, I have hoped for Thy salvation, and done Thy
        commandments,’ <19B9166> Psalm 119:166. In this manner was David led to
        serve God. When, according to the precious promise of our blessed Lord,
        the Spirit takes of the things that are His — the glory of His person,
        and the perfection of His work — and discovers them to us, we then know
        whom we have believed, the conscience is discharged from guilt; and
        thus, hoping in God, and having our hearts enlarged, we run the way of
        His commandments, <19B932> Psalm 119:32, and bring forth the fruits of
        the Spirit, love, joy, and peace. But how can there be love without a
        sense of reconciliation with God; and how can the fruits of joy and
        peace be brought forth till the conscience is discharged from guilt? It
        is earnestly and repeatedly enjoined on believers to rejoice in the
        Lord; but how can they rejoice in Him unless they have the persuasion
        that they belong to Him? ‘The joy of the Lord is your strength,’
        Nehemiah 8:10. ‘The end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure
        heart, and a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,’ 1 Timothy 1:5.
        Love flows from a pure heart, a pure heart from a good conscience, and a
        good conscience from true faith. The necessity of a good conscience, in
        order to acceptable obedience to God, is forcibly pointed out, Hebrews
        9:14. ‘How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
        Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
        dead works to serve the living God?’ Till this takes place, all a man’s
        doings are dead works , or, as the Apostle expresses it in the seventh
        chapter of this Epistle, ‘fruit unto death.’ An evil or guilty
        conscience leads a man to keep at a distance from God, like Adam, who,
        conscious of his guilt, hid himself among the trees of the garden. But
        when the conscience is made good, — that is, is at peace, — the heart is
        purified, and love is produced. Then, and not till then, when ascribing
        praise to the Lamb who has washed us from our sins in His own blood, and
        having a sense of reconciliation with God, and of the enjoyment of His
        favor, we serve Him in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the
        letter — not from servile fear, but with gratitude and filial affection.
        Thus, having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
        by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated for us through the
        vail, that is to say, His flesh; and having an High Priest over the
        house of God, we draw near with a true heart, in the full assurance of
        faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
        bodies washed with pure water. We enjoy the persuasion that by His mercy
        we are saved by the wishing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
        Ghost. ‘Come unto Me, and I will give you rest.’ What is this rest but
        that peace and repose of the soul which can never be found but in God?
        Then we can adopt the language of the Psalmist, ‘I will go unto God, my
        exceeding joy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Spirit of God being holy, will not produce Christian assurance
        without at the same time producing sanctification, and by this
        sanctification the persuasion is confirmed of our communion with God;
        for although our sanctification be imperfect, it is a certain mark of
        our election.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we feel a holy sadness for having offended God, we enjoy the
        blessedness of those who mourn, and are assured that we shall be
        comforted. When we hunger and thirst after righteousness, we have the
        promise that we shall be filled. This mourning for sin, and thirsting
        after righteousness, on which the Savior pronounces His blessing, can
        only proceed from the Spirit of God, and not from the desire of the
        carnal mind, which is enmity against God. The fruits of the Spirit are
        first produced by believing in Christ, trusting in Him, and regarding
        what He has done without us, and are increased and confirmed by what He
        is doing within us. Abounding in the fruits of righteousness, we make
        our calling and election sure. Keeping his commandments, we prove our
        love to our Savior, and He manifests Himself to us as He doeth not unto
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal application, or the appropriation of faith, is often signalized
        in Scripture. Moses says; ‘The Lord is my strength and my song, and He
        is become my salvation: He is my God,’ Exodus 15:2. Job says, ‘I know
        that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon
        the earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
        flesh shall I see God,’ Job 19:25. ‘I know,’ says David, ‘that God is
        for me,’ Psalm 56:9. ‘The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want,’ Psalm
        23:1. ‘The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup,’ Psalm
        16:5. ‘I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and
        my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will
        trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower,’
        Psalm 18:1. ‘I know,’ says Paul, ‘whom I have believed.’ John says, ‘We
        have known and believed the love that God hath to us.’ Peter, classing
        himself with those to whom he wrote, blesses God that he and they were
        begotten again to a lively hope of an inheritance reserved in heaven;
        and, referring to their final perseverance, he adds, that they were
        ‘kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation.’ In the hope
        of that salvation, those who received the doctrine of the Apostles
        rejoiced as soon as it was announced to them, Acts 2:41, 8:39, 16:34.
        Their joy, then, had not its source in reflection on, or consciousness
        of, their faith, or its effects, although afterwards so confirmed, but
        arose, in the first instance, from the view they had of the glory and
        all-sufficiency of the Savior, and His perfect righteousness made theirs
        by faith, resting on the Divine warrant and promise, ‘In whom we have
        boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,’ Ephesians
        3:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the assurance of sense be confirmatory of the assurance of
        faith it is not so strong as the latter. ‘Sanctification,’ says
        Rutherford, ‘does not evidence justification as faith doth evidence it,
        with such a sort of clearness as light evidences colors, though it be no
        sign or evident mark of them; but as smoke evidences fire, and as the
        morning star in the east evidenceth the sun will shortly rise; or as the
        streams prove there is a head-spring whence they issue; though none of
        these make what they evidence visible to the eye; so doth sanctification
        give evidence of justification, only as marks, signs, effects, give
        evidence of the cause. But the light of faith, the testimony of the
        Spirit by the operation of free grace, will cause us, as it were, with
        our eyes, see justification and faith, not by report, but as we see the
        sun’s light.’
      </p>
      <p>
        If it be objected that a man cannot know that he has faith without
        seeing its effects; it is replied that this is contrary to fact. When a
        thing is testified, or a promise is made to us, we know whether or not
        we believe it, or trust in it. According to this objection, when Philip
        said, ‘If thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest,’ the eunuch
        should have replied, ‘You ask me to tell you a thing I cannot know;’ but
        instead of this, he answers, ‘I believe.’ When the Lord asked the blind
        man, ‘Believest thou in the Son of God?’ he did not ask a question which
        it was impossible to answer. Does the Spirit of God cry in the hearts of
        believers, ‘Abba, Father,’ and witness with their spirits that they are
        the children of God, without their being able to know it? If, however,
        the flesh raises doubts in the believer, from the weakness of his faith,
        he should consider that the weakness of his faith does not prevent it
        from being true faith; that God accepts not the perfection but the
        reality of faith; that Jesus Christ recognized the faith of him who
        said, ‘Lord, I believe; help Thou my unbelief; ‘and that these doubts
        are not in his faith, but opposed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are in the flesh, with the believer resists, and says with Paul,
        ‘Now, if I do what I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that
        dwelleth in me.’ ‘In the first act of believing,’ says Mr. Bell in his
        work On the Covenants , ‘sinners have no evidence of grace in
        themselves: they feel nothing within but sin; they see a word without
        them as the sole foundation of faith, and on that alone they build for
        eternity. This is a point of no small importance to saints and sinners.
        Many of the modern builders are at great pains to keep their hearers
        from all confidence till they first discern the evidences of grace in
        their hearts; and, having got evidence, then, and not till then, can
        they have any just, lawful, or well-grounded confidence, — nay, they
        seem pretty plainly to intimate that a sinner’s right to Christ turns on
        something wrought in him, or done by him, and till he have evidence of
        this, he can claim no interest in Christ, nor assure himself of
        salvation by Him. According to this, Christ, the Tree of Life, is
        forbidden fruit, which the sinner must not touch till he has seen inward
        evidence. I confess I have not so learned Christ. The sinner’s right to
        Christ turns not at all upon any inward gracious qualifications, but
        purely on the Divine warrant revealed in the word. Faith is not a
        qualification in order to come to Christ, but the coming itself; it is
        not our right to Christ, but our taking and receiving Him to ourselves
        on the footing of the right conveyed by the Gospel offer.’ ‘Tis a thing
        of huge difficulty,’ says Archbishop Leighton, ‘to bring men to a sense
        of their natural misery, to see that they have need of a Savior, and to
        look out for one. But then, being brought to that, ‘tis no less, if not
        more difficult, to persuade them that Christ is He; that as they have
        need of Him, so they need no more, He being able and sufficient for
        them. All the waverings and fears of misbelieving minds do spring from
        dark and narrow apprehensions of Jesus; Christ. All the doubt is not of
        their interest, as they imagine; they who say so, and think it is so, do
        not perceive the bottom and root of their own malady. They say they do
        no whit doubt but that He is able enough, and His righteousness large
        enough, but all the doubt is, if He belong to me. Now, I say this doubt
        arises from a defect and doubt of the former, wherein you suspect it
        not. Why doubtest thou that He belongs to thee? Dost thou fly to Him, as
        lost and undone in thyself? Dost thou renounce all that can be called
        thine, and seek thy life in Him? Then He is thine. He came to seek and
        to save that which was lost .
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh I but I find so much not only former but still daily renewed and
        increasing guiltiness. Why? Is He a sufficient Savior, or is He not? If
        thou dost say He is not, then it is manifest that here lies the defect
        and mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        If thou sayest He is, then hast thou answered all thy objections of that
        kind: much guiltiness much or little, old or new, neither helps nor
        hinders, as to thy interest in Him, and salvation by Him. And for
        dispelling of these mists, nothing can be more effectual than the
        letting in of those Gospel beams, the clear expressions of His riches
        and fullness in the Scriptures, and eminently this — made of God wisdom
        and righteousness.’ The religion of the Church of Rome leaves a man
        nothing but doubts respecting his salvation. It teaches, as has been
        formerly remarked, that a Christian should believe in general the
        promises of God, while personal application of these promises, and
        assurance of God’s love, it calls presumption. This subject was one of
        the grand points of discussion between that church and the Reformers.
        But how many Protestants have forsaken the ground which their
        predecessors here occupied, and have gone over to that of their
        opponents! The doctrine of the duty of our personal assurance of
        salvation, and the persuasion of our interest in Christ, is denied by
        many, and doubts concerning this are even converted into evidences of
        faith, although they are directly opposed to it. Doubts of a personal
        interest in Christ, are evidences either of little faith or of no faith.
        ‘O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?’ If this assurance
        were built on anything except on the foundation that God Himself hath
        laid, it would indeed be eminently presumptuous. But, in opposition to
        such opinions, the Apostle John has written a whole Epistle to lead
        Christians to this assurance. ‘He that believeth on the Son of God hath
        the witness in himself. He that believeth not God hath made Him a liar:
        because He believeth not the witness which God hath witnessed concerning
        His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this is the witness, that God hath given to us eternal life; and
        this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that
        hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto
        you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye
        have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of
        God.’ ‘This assurance,’ says Archbishop Leighton, ‘is no enemy to holy
        diligence, nor friend to carnal security; on the contrary, it is the
        only thing that doth eminently enable and embolden the soul for all
        adventures and services. Base fears and doubtings, wherein some place
        much of religion, and many weak Christians seem to be in that mistake,
        to think it a kind of Holy Spiritual temper to be questioning and
        doubting. I say, then, base fears can never produce anything truly
        generous, no height of obedience, — they do nothing but entangle and
        disable the soul for every good work; perfect love casts out this fear,
        and works a sweet unperplexing fear, a holy wariness, not to offend,
        which fears nothing else. And this confidence of love is the great
        secret of comfort, and of ability to do God service. Nothing makes so
        strong and healthful a constitution of soul as pure love: it dare submit
        to God and resign itself to Him; it dare venture itself in His hand, and
        seeks no more but how to please Him. A heart thus composed goes readily
        and cheerfully unto all services, to do, to suffer, to live, to die, at
        His pleasure; and firmly stands to this, that nothing can separate from
        that which is sufficient to it, what is all its happiness, the love of
        God in Christ Jesus.’ ‘It is true that all Christians have not alike
        clear and firm apprehension of their happy and true state, and scarce
        any of them are alike at all times; yet they have all and always the
        same right to this state and to the comfort of it; and where they stand
        in a right light to view it, they do see it so, and rejoice in it. Many
        Christians do prejudice their own comfort, and darken their spirits, by
        not giving freedom to faith to act according to its nature and proper
        principles; they will not believe till they find some evidence or
        assurance, which is quite to invert the order of the thing, and to look
        for fruit without settling a root for it to grow from. Would you take
        Christ upon the absolute word of promise tendering Him to you, and rest
        on Him, this would ingraft you into life itself, for that He is; and so
        those fruits of the Holy Ghost would bud and flourish in your hearts.
        From that very believing on Him would arise this persuasion, yea, even
        to a gloriation, and an humble boasting in His love, — who shall accuse?
        who shall condemn ? who shall separate? ’ In opposition to the
        believer’s personal assurance of salvation, Satan will represent to him
        the number and enormity of his sins, and the strictness of God’s
        justice, which has often fallen on those whom He hardens. But believers
        will answer, ‘We know that to God belongeth righteousness, and unto us
        confusion of faces, but mercy and pardon belong to the Lord our God. If
        our sins ascend to heaven, His mercy is above the heavens. It is true
        that sin abounds in us; but where sin abounded grace and mercy have much
        more abounded; and the greater our misery, the greater towards us is the
        glory of the mercy of God. In entering into paradise, our Lord Jesus
        Christ has not taken with Him angels, but the spirit of a malefactor,
        that we might know that the greatest sinners are objects of His
        compassion. He came into the world to save sinners, and He calls to
        Himself those who are heavy laden with sin. He came to proclaim liberty
        to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.
        The more, then, that we feel the power of sin, the closer we cleave to
        Him. If Peter, affrighted, exclaimed, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful
        man, O Lord,” let us, on the contrary, say, Lord Jesus, we come to Thee,
        and the more so because we are sinners; for Thou hast been made sin for
        us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
        Thee. We have sinned seventy times, and seventy times have fallen again
        into sin; but God, who commands us to forgive offenses even seventy
        times seven, will many more times pardon! In comparison of His love, the
        love of man is not as a drop to the ocean.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation on which believers repel doubts concerning their
        salvation rests on the excellence of their Mediator, His love and
        compassion for them, the merit of His obedience, and their communion
        with Him. As to the excellence of their Mediator, He is the eternal Son
        of God, the Beloved of the Father, for whom they are beloved in Him, and
        His intercession for them is acceptable to God and efficacious. ‘We have
        a great High Priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of
        God.’ ‘He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
        Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.’ It rests on
        the love and compassion of Jesus. ‘For we have not an High Priest which
        cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all
        points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.’ His love to us has been
        stronger than death; and He Himself saith, ‘Greater love hath no man
        than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’ Having thus
        given Himself for us, will He reject us? Having ascended to heaven, will
        He forget us, for whom He descended to earth and for whom, as the
        forerunner, He hath again entered heaven to intercede for us, to prepare
        a place, and to receive us to Himself?
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers rest their assurance of salvation on the merit of their
        Redeemer’s obedience; for when their sins are red as crimson, they shall
        be made white as snow. Our robes have been washed in the blood of the
        Lamb, whose blood cleanseth us from all sin. It is impossible that sin
        can be more powerful to destroy us, than the grace of God and the merit
        of Jesus Christ to save us. We are condemned by the law; but, in answer
        to the law, we plead the blood of Jesus Christ, who hath borne the curse
        of the law, and who is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
        that believeth. We have been condemned by the justice of God; but to
        this justice we present the righteousness of Christ, who is ‘Jehovah our
        righteousness.’ God hath been angry with us; but in Jesus Christ He hath
        not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in
        Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the temptations of Satan, believers also oppose their union with
        Jesus Christ; for Jesus Christ and they are one. We are His members,
        bone of His bones, and flesh of His flesh; His obedience is our
        obedience; for as we are one body with Him, we appear before our God in
        Him. We are found in Him, not having our own righteousness, which is of
        the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
        righteousness which is of God by faith. By union with Him we are already
        seated together in heavenly places in Christ. As Jesus Christ has risen
        to die no more, but to live eternally, it follows that the righteousness
        which He has wrought is an everlasting righteousness, and that, being
        united to Him as His members, we derive from Him a life which cannot
        fail, so that we shall never die; for as the risen Head dies no more,
        and His life is an everlasting life, in like manner, whoever receives
        spiritual life from Him, receives a life which can never terminate.
        Hence it follows that the resurrection of Jesus Christ, assuring us of
        our justification and eternal life, is a source of the greatest joy and
        consolation. The Psalmist, accordingly, prophesying of the resurrection
        of Christ, says ‘that his heart is glad, and his glory rejoiceth.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The first words of Jesus Christ to Mary, after His resurrection, were,
        ‘Woman, why weepest thou?’ and to the other women, ‘Be not afraid;’ and
        to the disciples, ‘Why are ye troubled?’ His resurrection ought to wipe
        away the tears of His people, to tranquilize their minds, and dissipate
        their fears, by the assurance it gives of their acquittal from
        condemnation before God, and of the destruction of him who had the power
        of death. ‘The words of Jesus, above referred to,’ says an eloquent
        writer, ‘are generally applicable to the life of a Christian. He can
        look upon that rich field of privilege and of promise placed before him
        in the Bible, and can say that it is all his own. And where is the want
        that the blessed fruits of that field cannot supply, the distress which
        they cannot relieve, the wound that they cannot heal, the fear that they
        cannot quiet, or the sorrow for which they do not furnish abundant
        consolation? Where, then, is the cause of depression? Friend of Jesus,
        why weepest thou? If you have an Advocate with the Father, through whom
        you sins are all forgiven, and you are made a child of God, — and the
        Holy Ghost is given you as your Sanctifier and Comforter, — and you are
        assured of having almighty power for your support, and unerring wisdom
        for your guide, and heaven for your eternal home — what can overbalance
        or suppress the joy which naturally results from such privileges as
        these? Trials we may, we must, meet with; but can these depress us, when
        we know that our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for
        us a far more exceeding, even an eternal weight of glory? If tried by
        bodily pain, we feel more keenly the happiness of the hope which
        anticipates the time when we shall have a building of God, a house not
        made with hands, eternal in the heavens! Worldly losses will not
        overwhelm us, if we know that we are undoubted heirs of an inheritance
        that is incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. Friends may
        change, but we will be comforted by the assurance that in Christ we have
        a brother born for adversity, — nay, a friend that sticketh closer than
        a brother. There rolls between us and our Father’s house the deep and
        restless tide of this world’s corruption, through which we must of
        necessity pass, and the deeper and still more dangerous tide of the
        corruption of our hearts, and we are surrounded by enemies on every
        side; and when we feel our own weakness, we may be ready to fear lest we
        should one day fall by the hand of some of them. But every distressing
        fear is removed, when we recollect that we shall not be tempted beyond
        what we are able to bear, and that, in point of fact, there is no limit
        to our power, for we can do all things through Christ strengthening us,
        and that the life that is in us is the life of Christ, a life which no
        power can extinguish in any one of Christ’s members, any more than it
        can extinguish it in our glorious Head.’
      </p>
      <p>
        From the 28th verse to the conclusion of the chapter, the greatest
        encouragement is held out to repose all our confidence on the love of
        God in Christ Jesus, with the assured conviction that, receiving Him, we
        shall be enabled to persevere unto the end. The impossibility of
        plucking His people out of the Savior’s hand is here established in the
        most triumphant manner. Whatever objection is raised against it, is
        contrary to the power of Jesus Christ, contrary to His love, to the
        virtue of His sacrifice, and to the prevalence of His intercession, —
        contrary to the operation of the whole Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy
        Ghost, in every part of the plan of salvation. If we look upwards or
        downwards, — to heaven above, or the earth or hell beneath, — to all
        places, to all creatures, — neither any nor all of them together shall
        prevail against us. Were heaven and earth to combine, and all the powers
        of hell to rise up, they would avail nothing against the outstretched
        arm of Him who makes us more than conquerors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of Jesus, who is our Head, ascends above the heavens, and
        descends beneath the depths; and in His love there is a breadth, and
        length, and depth, and height, which passeth knowledge. ‘Thy mercy, O
        Lord, is in the heavens, and Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.
        Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; Thy judgments are a great
        deep,’ Psalm 36:5. Can anything prevail to pluck out of the hands of
        Jesus Christ those who have fled to Him as their surety, — those who are
        members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones, — those whom He
        hath purchased with His precious blood?
      </p>
      <p>
        The feelings of the believer, viewed in Christ, as described in the
        close of this chapter, form a striking contrast with what is said in the
        end of the former chapter, where he is viewed in himself. In the
        contemplation of himself as a sinner, he mournfully exclaims, ‘O
        wretched man that I am!’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the contemplation of himself as justified in Christ, he boldly
        demands, Who shall lay anything to my charge? Who is he that condemneth?
        Well may the man who loves God defy the universe to separate him from
        the love of God which is in Christ Jesus his Lord. Although at present
        the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together, although
        even he himself groaneth within himself, yet all things are working
        together for his good. The Holy Spirit is interceding for him in his
        heart; Jesus Christ is interceding for him before the throne; God the
        Father hath chosen him from eternity, hath called him, hath justified
        him, and will finally crown him with glory. The Apostle had begun this
        chapter by declaring that there is no condemnation to them who are in
        Christ Jesus: he concludes it with the triumphant assurance that there
        is no separation from His love. The salvation of believers is complete
        in Christ, and their union with Him indissoluble.
