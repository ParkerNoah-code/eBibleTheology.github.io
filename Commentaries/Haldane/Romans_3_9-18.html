      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 9. — What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
        have before proved both Jew and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here commences the second part of the chapter, in which, having proposed
        and replied to the above objections to his doctrine, Paul now resumes
        the thread of his discourse. In the two preceding chapters he had
        asserted the guilt of the Gentiles and of the Jews separately; in what
        follows he takes them together, and proves by express testimonies from
        Scripture that all men are sinners, and that there is none righteous,
        no, not one. In this manner he follows up and completes his argument to
        support the conclusion at which he is about to arrive in the 20th verse,
        which all along he had in view, namely, that by works of law no man can
        be justified, and with the purpose of fully unfolding, in verses 21, 22,
        23, and 24, the means that God has provided for our justification, which
        he had briefly announced, ch. 1:17. In the verse before us he shows
        that, although he has admitted that the advantages of the Jews over the
        Gentiles are great, it must not thence be concluded that the Jews are
        better than they. When he says ‘are we better,’ he classes himself with
        the Jews, to whom he was evidently referring; but when, in the last
        clause of the verse, he employs the same term ‘we,’ he evidently speaks
        in his own person, although, as in some other places, in the plural
        number. What then? are we better than they? — The common translation
        here is juster than Mr. Stuart’s, which is, ‘have we any preference?’
        The Jews had a preference. The Apostle allows that they had many
        advantages, and that they had a preference over the Gentiles; but he
        denies that they were better. Not at all. — By no means. This is a
        strong denial of what is the subject of the question. Then he gives the
        reason of the denial, namely, that he had before proved both Jews and
        Gentiles that they are all under sin. All not only signifies that there
        were sinners among both Jews and Gentiles, for the Jews did not deny
        this; on this point there was no difference between them and the
        Apostle; but he includes them all singly, without one exception. It is
        in this sense of universality that what he has hitherto said, both of
        Jews and Gentiles, must be taken. Of all that multitude of men there was
        not found one who had not wandered from the right way. One alone, Jesus
        Christ, was without sin, and it is on this account that the Scriptures
        call Him the ‘Just or Righteous One,’ to distinguish Him by this
        singular character from the rest of men. Under sin . — That is to say,
        guilty; for it is in relation to the tribunal of Divine justice that the
        Apostle here considers sin, in the same way as he says, Galatians 3:22,
        ‘The Scripture hath concluded (shut up) all under sin, that the promise
        by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.’ That it
        is in this sense we must understand the expression under sin and not, as
        Roman Catholic commentators explain it, as under the dominion of sin,
        evidently appears, — 1st , Because in this discussion, to be under sin
        is opposed to being under grace. Now, to be under grace, Romans 6:14,15,
        signifies to be in a state of justification before God, our sins being
        pardoned. To be under sin, then, signifies to be guilty in the eye of
        justice. 2nd , It is in reference to the tribunal of Divine justice, and
        in the view of condemnation, that Paul has all along been considering
        sin, both in respect to Jews and Gentiles. To be under sin, then, can
        only signify to be guilty, since he here repeats in summary all that he
        had before advanced. Finally, he explains his meaning clearly when he
        says, in verse 19, ‘that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world
        may become guilty before God.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 10. — As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.</p>
      <p>
        After having proceeded in his discussion, appealing to the natural
        sentiments of conscience and undeniable fact, Paul now employs the
        authority of Scripture, and alleges several passages drawn from the
        books of the Old Testament, written at different times, more clearly to
        establish the universal guilt both of Jews and Gentiles, in order that
        he might prove them all under condemnation before the tribunal of God.
        There is none righteous. — This passage may be regarded as the leading
        proposition, the truth of which the Apostle is about to establish by the
        following quotations. None could be more appropriate or better adapted
        to his purpose, which was to show that every man is in himself entirely
        divested of righteousness. There is none righteous, no, not one. Not one
        possessed of a righteousness that can meet the demands of God’s holy
        law. The words in this verse, and those contained in verses 11 and 12,
        are taken from Psalms 14: and <195301> 53, which are the same as to the
        sense, although they do not follow the exact expressions. But does it
        seem proper that Paul should draw a consequence in relation to all, from
        what David has only said of the wicked of his time? The answer is, That
        the terms which David employs are too strong not to contemplate the
        universal sinfulness of the human race. ‘The Lord looked down from
        heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did
        understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside; they are altogether
        become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.’ This
        notifies universal depravity, so that, according to the Prophet, the
        application is just. It is not that David denies that God had sanctified
        some men by His Spirit; for, on the contrary, in the same Psalm, he
        speaks of the afflicted, of whom God is the refuge; but the intention is
        to say that, in their natural condition, without the grace of
        regeneration, which God vouchsafes only to His people, who are a small
        number, the whole human race is in a state of universal guilt and
        condemnation. This is also what is meant by Paul, and it is the use, as
        is clear from the context, that he designed to make of this passage of
        David, according to which none are excepted in such a way as that, if
        God examined them by their obedience to the law, they could stand before
        Him; and, besides this, whatever holiness is found in any man, it is not
        by the efficacy of the law, but by that of the Gospel, and if they are
        now sanctified, they were formerly under sin as well as others; so that
        it remains a truth, that all who are under the law, to which the Apostle
        is exclusively referring, are under sin that is, guilty before God.
        Through the whole of this discussion, it is to be observed that the
        Apostle makes no reference to the doctrine of sanctification. It is to
        the law exclusively that he refers, and here, without qualification, he
        asserts it as a universal truth that there is none righteous — not one
        who possesses righteousness, that is, in perfect conformity to the law;
        and his sole object is to prove the necessity of receiving the
        righteousness of God in order to be delivered from condemnation. The
        passage, then, here adduced by Paul, is strictly applicable to his
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight supposes that this expression, ‘There is none righteous,’
        applies to the Jewish common people, and is an Eastern expression, which
        means that comparatively very few are excepted. There is not the shadow
        of ground for such a supposition. It is evident that both the passages
        quoted, and the Apostle’s argument, require that every individual of the
        human race be included. And on what pretense can it be restricted to
        ‘the Jewish common people’? Whether were they or their leaders the
        objects of the severest reprehensions of our Lord during His ministry?
        Did not Jesus pronounce the heaviest woes on the scribes and Pharisees?
        Matthew 23:15. Did He not tell the chief priests and elders that the
        publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before them?
        Matthew 21:31.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart also supposes that the charge is not unlimited, and justifies
        this by alleging that the believing Jews must be excepted. But it is
        clear that the believing Jews are not excepted. For though they are now
        delivered, yet they were by nature under sin as well as others; and that
        all men are so, is what Paul is teaching, without having the smallest
        reference to the Gospel or its effects. In this manner Dr. Macknight and
        Mr. Stuart, entirely mistaking the meaning of the Apostle and the whole
        drift of his argument, remove the foundation of the proofs he adduces
        that all men are sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart also appears to limit the charges to the Jews, and in support
        of this refers to the 9th and 19th verses. The 9th verse speaks of both
        Jews and Gentiles; and the purpose of the 19th evidently is to prove
        that the Jews are not excepted; while the 20th clearly shows that the
        whole race of mankind are included, it being the general conclusion
        which the Apostle draws from all he had said, from the 18th verse of the
        first chapter, respecting both Jews and Gentiles, of whom he affirms in
        the 9th verse that they were all under sin. And is it not strictly true,
        in the fullest import of the term, that there is none righteous in
        himself, no, not one? Is not righteousness the fulfilling of the law?
        ‘And do not the Scriptures testify and everywhere show that ‘there is no
        man that sinneth not’? Kings 8:46. ‘Who can say, I have made my heart
        clean, I am pure from my sin?’ Proverbs 20:9. ‘For there is not a just
        man upon earth; that doeth good and sinneth not,’ Ecclesiastes 7:20. And
        the Apostle James, including himself as well as his brethren to whom he
        wrote, declares, ‘In many things we all offend’. f15 Like Mr. Stuart,
        Taylor of Norwich in his Commentary, supposes that in this and the
        following verses to the 19th, the Apostle means no universality at all,
        but only the far greater part, and that they refer to bodies of people,
        of Jews and Gentiles in a collective sense, and not to particular
        persons. To this President Edwards, in his treatise On Original Sin , p.
        245, replies, ‘If the words which the Apostle uses do not most fully and
        determinably signify a universality, no words ever used in the Bible are
        sufficient to do it. I might challenge any man to produce any one
        paragraph in the Scripture, from the beginning to the end, where there
        is such a repetition and accumulation of terms, so strongly and
        emphatically, and carefully, to express the most perfect and absolute
        universality, or any place to be compared to it. What instance is there
        in the scripture, or indeed any other writing, when the meaning is only
        the much greater part, where this meaning is signified in such a manner
        by repeating such expressions, They are all — they are all — they are
        all — together one — all the world, joined to multiplied negative terms,
        to show the universality to be without exception, saying, There is no
        flesh — there is none — there is none — there is none — there is none
        four times over, besides the addition of no, not one — no, not one, once
        and again! When the Apostle says, ‘That every mouth may be stopped, must
        we suppose that he speaks only of those two great collective bodies,
        figuratively ascribing to each of them a mouth, and means that those two
        mouths are stopped?’ Again, p. 241, ‘Here the thing which I would prove,
        viz., that mankind, in their first state, before they are interested in
        the benefits of Christ redemption, are universally wicked, is declared
        with the utmost possible fullness and precision. So that, if here this
        matter be not set forth plainly, expressly, and fully, it must be
        because no words can do it; and it is not in the power of language, or
        any manner of terms or phrases, however contrived and heaped one upon
        another, determinably to signify any such thing.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
        after God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here applies equally to Jews and Gentiles that which he charges
        upon the Gentiles, Ephesians 4:18, ‘Having the understanding darkened,
        being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in
        them because of the blindness (or hardness) of their hearts.’ This is
        true of every individual of the human race naturally. ‘The natural man
        receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness
        unto him.’ In the parable of the sower, the radical distinction between
        those who finally reject, and those who receive the word and bring forth
        fruit, is, that they who were fruitful ‘understood’ the word, while the
        others understood it not, Matthew 13:19-23, and the new man, he who is
        born again, is said to be renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him
        that created him. The assertion, then, in this passage, requires no
        limitation with respect to those who are now believers, for they were
        originally like others. All men are naturally ignorant of God, and by
        neglecting the one thing needful, show no understanding. They act more
        irrationally than the beasts. Now that seeketh after God. — To seek God
        is an expression frequently used in Scripture to denote the acts of
        religion and piety. It supposes the need all men have to go out of
        themselves to seek elsewhere their support, their life, and happiness,
        and the distance at which naturally we are from God, and God from us, —
        we by our perversity, and He by His just wrath. It teaches how great is
        the blindness of those who seek anything else but God, in order to be
        happy, since true wisdom consists in seeking God for this, for He alone
        is the sovereign good to man. It also teaches us that during the whole
        course of our life God proposes Himself as the object that men are to
        seek, Isaiah 55:6, for the present is the time of His calling them, and
        if they do not find Him, it is owing to their perversity, which causes
        them to flee from Him, or to seek Him in a wrong way. To seek God is, in
        general, to answer to all His relative perfections; that is to say, to
        respect and adore His sovereign majesty, to instruct ourselves in His
        word as the primary truth, to obey His commandments as the commandments
        of the sovereign Legislator of men, to have recourse to Him by prayer as
        the origin of all things. In particular, it is to have recourse to His
        mercy by repentance; it is to place our confidence in Him; it is to ask
        for his Holy Spirit to support us, and to implore His protection and
        blessing; and all this through Him who is the way to the Father, and who
        declares that no man cometh to the Father but by Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
        unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sin is a wandering or departure from the right way; that is to say, out
        of the way of duty and obligation, out of the way of the means which
        conduct to felicity. These are the ways open before the eyes of men to
        walk in them; he who turns from there wanders out of the way. The
        Prophet here teaches what is the nature of sin; he also shows us what
        are its consequences; for as the man who loses his way cannot have any
        rest in his mind, nor any security, it is the same with the sinner; and
        as a wanderer cannot restore himself to the right way without the help
        of a guide, in the same manner the sinner cannot restore himself, if the
        Holy Spirit comes not to his aid. They are together become unprofitable.
        — They have become corrupted, or have rendered themselves useless; for
        everything that is corrupted loses its use. They are become unfit for
        that for which God made them; unprofitable to God, to themselves, and to
        their neighbor. There is none that doeth good, no, not one — not one who
        cometh up to the requirements of the law of God. This is the same as is
        said above, there is none righteous, and both the Prophet and the
        Apostle make use of this repetition to enhance the greatness and the
        extent of human corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they
        have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the Apostle had said in the preceding verses was general; he now
        descends to something more particular, both respecting words and
        actions, and in this manner follows up his assertion, that there is none
        that doeth good, by showing that all men are engaged in doing evil. As
        to their words, he marks in this and the following verse, all the organs
        of speech, the throat, the tongue, the lips, the mouth. All this tends
        to aggravate the depravity of which he speaks. The first part of this
        verse is taken from Psalm 5:9, and the last from <19E003> Psalm 140:3.
        Open sepulcher. — This figure graphically portrays the filthy
        conversation of the wicked. Nothing can be more abominable to the senses
        than an open sepulcher, where a dead body beginning to putrefy steams
        forth its tainted exhalations. What proceeds out of their mouth is
        infected and putrid; and as the exhalation from a sepulcher proves the
        corruption within, so it is with the corrupt conversation of sinners.
        With their tongues they have used deceit — used them to deceive their
        neighbor, or they have flattered with the tongue, and this flattery is
        joined with the intention to deceive. This also characterizes in a
        striking manner the way in which men employ speech to deceive each
        other, in bargains, and in everything in which their interest is
        concerned. The poison of asps is under their lips. — This denotes the
        mortal poison, such as that of vipers or asps, that lies concealed under
        the lips, and is emitted in poisoned words. As these venomous creatures
        kill with their poisonous sting, so slanderers and evil-minded persons
        destroy the characters of their neighbors. ‘Death and life,’ it is said
        in the Book of Proverbs, ‘are in the power of the tongue.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 14. — Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</p>
      <p>
        This is taken from Psalm 10:7. Paul describes in this and the foregoing
        verse the four principal vices of the tongue, — filthy and infected
        discourse; deceitful flatteries; subtle and piercing evil-speaking;
        finally, outrageous and open malediction. This last relates to the
        extraordinary propensity of men to utter imprecations against one
        another, proceeding from their being hateful and hating one another.
        Bitterness applies to the bitterness of spirit to which men give vent by
        bitter words. All deceit and fraud is bitter in the end, — that is to
        say, desolating and afflicting. ‘They bend their bows to shoot their
        arrows, even bitter words.’ ‘Their teeth are spears and arrows, and
        their tongue a sharp sword,’ Psalm 64:3, 57:4. ‘The tongue,’ says the
        Apostle James, ‘is set on fire of hell.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 15. — Their feet are swift to shed blood.</p>
      <p>
        After having spoken of men’s sinfulness, as shown by their words, the
        Apostle comes to that of actions, which he describes in this and the two
        following verses. This passage is taken from Isaiah 59:7, and from
        Proverbs 1:16, which describe the general sinfulness of men; the
        injustice and violence committed among them, and how ready they are to
        shed blood when not restrained either by the consideration of the good
        of society, or by fear of the laws. Every page of history attests the
        truth of this awful charge.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 16. — Destruction and misery are in their ways.</p>
      <p>
        This declaration, taken also from Isaiah 59:7, must be understood in an
        active sense, — that is to say, men labor to destroy and to ruin one
        another; proceeding in their perverse ways, they cause destruction and
        misery.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 17. — And the way of peace have they not known.</p>
      <p>
        They have not known peace to follow and approve of it; and are not
        acquainted with its ways, in which they do not walk in order to procure
        the good of their neighbor, — for peace imports prosperity, or the way
        to maintain concord and friendship. Such is a just description of man’s
        ferocity, which fills the world with animosities, quarrels, hatred in
        the private connections of families and neighborhoods; and with
        revolutions, and wars, and murders, among nations. The most savage
        animals do not destroy so many of their own species to appease their
        hunger, as man destroys of his fellows; to satiate his ambition, his
        revenge, or cupidity.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 18. — There is no fear of and before their eyes.</p>
      <p>
        This is taken from Psalm 36:1. After having followed up the general
        charge, that there is ‘none righteous, no, not one,’ by producing the
        preceding awful descriptions of human depravity, and having begun with
        the declaration of man’s want of understanding and his alienation from
        God, the Apostle here refers to the primary source of all these evils,
        with which he sums them up. There is ‘no fear of God before their eyes.’
        They have not that reverential fear of Him which is the beginning of
        wisdom, which is connected with departing from evil, and honoring and
        obeying Him, and is often spoken of in Scripture as the sum of all
        practical religion; on the contrary, they are regardless of His majesty
        and authority, His precepts and His threatenings. It is astonishing that
        men, while they acknowledge that there is a God, should act without any
        fear of His displeasure. Yet this is their character. They fear a worm
        of the dust like themselves, but disregard the Most-High, Isaiah
        51:12,18. They are more afraid of man than of God — of his anger, his
        contempt, or ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fear of man prevents them from doing many things from which they are
        not restrained by the fear of God. That God will put His fear in the
        hearts of His people, is one of the distinguishing promises of the new
        covenant, which shows that proof to this it is not found there.

        The Apostle could have collected a much greater number of passages from
        the law and the Prophets to prove what he intended, for there is nothing
        more frequent in the Old Testament than the reproaches of God against
        the Israelites, and all men, on account of their abandoning themselves
        to sin; but these form a very complete description of the reign of sin
        among men. The first of them, ver. 10, prefers the general charge of
        unrighteousness; the second, vers. 11, 12, marks the internal character
        or disorders of the heart; the third, vers. 13, 14, those of the words;
        the fourth, vers. 15, 16, 17, those of the actions; and the last, ver.
        18, declares the cause of the whole. In the first and second, we see the
        greatness of the corruption, and its universality: its greatness, in the
        extinction of all righteousness, of all wisdom, of all religion, of all
        rectitude, of all that is proper, and, in one word, of all that is good;
        its universality, in that it has seized upon the whole man, without
        leaving anything that is sound or entire. In the third, we observe the
        four vices of the tongue, which have been already pointed out, — namely
        corrupt conversation, flattery and deceit, envenomed slander, outrageous
        malediction. In the fourth, justice violated in what is most sacred —
        the life of man; charity subverted, in doing the evil which it
        prohibits; and that which is most fundamental and most necessary — peace
        — destroyed. And in the last, what is most essential entirely cast off,
        which is the fear of God. In this manner, having commenced his
        enumeration of the evils to which men are addicted, by pointing out
        their want of understanding and desire to seek Gods the Apostle
        terminates his description by exposing the source from whence they all
        show, which is, that men are destitute of the fear of God; His fear is
        not before their eyes to restrain them from evil. They love not His
        character, not rendering to it that veneration which is due; they
        respect not His authority. Such is the state of human nature while the
        heart is unchanged. From all this a faint idea may be formed of what
        will be the future state of those who shall perish, from whom the Gospel
        has been hid, — of those whose minds the God of this world has blinded,
        lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of
        God, should shine into them. Then the various restraints which in this
        life operate so powerfully, so extensively, and so constantly, will be
        taken off, and the natural depravity of fallen man will burst forth in
        all its unbridled and horrible wickedness.
