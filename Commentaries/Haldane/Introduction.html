      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        THE Epistle to the Romans was written by the Apostle Paul from Corinth,
        the capital of Achaia, after his second journey to that celebrated city
        for the purpose of collecting the pecuniary aid destined for the church
        at Jerusalem. This appears from the fifteenth chapter, where he says
        that he was going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. ‘For,’ he
        adds, ‘it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain
        contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.’ The Epistle
        appears to have been carried to Rome by Phebe, a deaconess of the church
        at Cenchrea, which was the port of Corinth; and we learn from the
        nineteenth and twentieth chapters of the Acts, and from different parts
        of the two Epistles to the Corinthians, that, after having remained
        about three years at Ephesus, Paul purposed to pass through Macedonia
        and Achaia, to receive the contributions of the Corinthians, and
        afterwards proceed to Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to the period when this Epistle was written, it is certain that it
        was at a time previous to Paul’s arrival at Rome. On this account, he
        begins by declaring to the disciples there that he had a great desire to
        see them, and to preach to them the Gospel; that he had often purposed
        this, but had hitherto always been prevented. This statement he repeats
        in the fifteenth chapter. It appears to be earlier in date than the
        Epistles to the Ephesians and Philippians, and those to the Hebrews and
        Philemon, and the Second to Timothy; for all of these were written
        during the Apostle’s first or second imprisonment at Rome, but later
        than the two Epistles to the Corinthians. It is generally supposed that
        it was written in the year 57 of the Christian era, about twenty-four
        years after the resurrection of our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding that this Epistle was written after some of the rest, it
        has been placed first in order among them on account of its excellence,
        and the abundance and sublimity of its contents. It contains, indeed, an
        abridgment of all that is taught in the Christian religion It treats of
        the revelation of God in the works of nature and in the heart of man,
        and exhibits the necessity and the strictness of the last judgment. It
        teaches the Doctrine of the fall, and corruption of the whole human
        race, of which it discovers the source and it’s greatness. It points out
        the true and right use of the law, and why God gave it to the
        Israelites; and also shows the variety of the temporal advantages over
        other men which the law conferred on them, and which they so criminally
        abused. It treats of the mission of our Lord Jesus Christ, of
        justification, of sanctification, of free will and grace, of salvation
        and condemnation, of election and of reprobation, of the perseverance
        and assurance of the salvation believers in the midst of their severest
        temptations, of the necessity of inflictions, and of the admirable
        consolations under them — of the calling of the Gentiles, of the
        rejection of the Jews and of their final restoration to the communion of
        God. Paul afterwards lays down the principal rules of Christian
        morality, containing all that we owe God, to ourselves, our neighbors,
        and to our brethren in Christ, and declares the manner in which we
        should act in our particular employments; uniformly accompanying his
        precepts with just and reasonable motives to enforce their practice. The
        form, too, of this Epistle is not less admirable than its matter. Its
        reasoning is powerful and conclusive; the style condensed, lively, and
        energetic; the arrangement orderly and clear, strikingly exhibiting the
        leading doctrines as the main branches from which depend all the graces
        and virtues of the Christian life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole is pervaded by a strain of the most exalted piety, true
        holiness, ardent zeal, and fervent charity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Epistle, like the greater part of those written by Paul, is divided
        into two general parts, — the first of which contains the doctrine, and
        extends to the beginning of the twelfth chapter; and the second, which
        relates to practice, goes on to the conclusion. The first is to instruct
        the spirit, and the other to direct the heart; the one teaches what we
        are to believe, the other what we are to practice. In the first part he
        discusses chiefly the two great questions which at the beginning of the
        Gospel were agitated between the Jews and the Christians, namely, that
        of justification before God, and that of the calling of the Gentiles.
        For as, on the one hand, the Gospel held forth a method of justification
        very different from that of the law, the Jews could not relish a
        doctrine which appeared to them novel, and was contrary to their
        prejudices; and as, on the other hand, they found themselves in
        possession of the covenant of God, to the exclusion of other nations,
        they could not endure that the Apostles should call the Gentiles to the
        knowledge of the true God, and to the hope of His salvation, nor that it
        should be supposed that the Jews had lost their exclusive pre-eminence
        over the nations. The principal object, then, of the Apostle was to
        combat these two prejudices. He directs his attention to the former in
        the first nine chapters, and treats of the other in the tenth and
        eleventh.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to what regards the second portion of the Epistle, Paul first enjoins
        general precepts for the conduct of believers, afterwards in regard to
        civil life, and finally with regard to church communion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first five chapters, the great doctrine of justification by
        faith, of which they exclusively treat, is more fully discussed than in
        any other part of Scripture. The design of the Apostle is to establish
        two things: the one is, that there being only two ways of justification
        before God, namely, that of works, which the law proposes, and that of
        grace by Jesus Christ, which the Gospel reveals, — the first is entirely
        shut against men, and, in order to their being saved, there remains only
        the last. The other thing that he designs to establish is, that
        justification by grace, through faith in Jesus Christ, respects
        indifferently all men, both Jews and Gentiles, and that it abolishes the
        distinction which the law had made between them. To arrive at this, he
        first proves that the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, are subject if the
        judgment of God; but that, being all sinners and guilty, neither the one
        nor the other can escape condemnation by their works. He humbles them
        both. He sets before the Gentiles the blind ignorance and
        unrighteousness both of themselves and of their philosophers, of whom
        they boasted; and he teaches humility to the Jews, by showing that they
        were chargeable with similar vices. He undermines in both the pride of
        self-merit, and teaches all to build their hopes on Jesus Christ alone;
        proving that their salvation can neither emanate from their philosophy
        nor from their law, but from the grace of Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first chapter, the Apostle commences by directing our attention
        to the person of the Son of God in His incarnation in time, and His
        Divine nature from eternity, as the great subject of that Gospel which
        he was commissioned to proclaim. After a most striking introduction,
        every way calculated to arrest the attention and conciliate the
        affection of those whom he addressed, he briefly announces the grand
        truth, which he intends afterwards to establish, that ‘the Gospel is the
        power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,’ because in it
        is revealed ‘THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD.’ Unless such a righteousness had
        been provided, all men must have suffered the punishment due to sin,
        seeing God hath denounced His high displeasure against all ‘ungodliness
        and unrighteousness .’ These are the great truths which the Apostle
        immediately proceeds to unfold. And as they stand connected with every
        part of that salvation which God has prepared, he is led to exhibit a
        most animating and consolatory view of the whole plan of mercy, which
        proclaims ‘glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
        towards men’.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first point which the Apostle establishes, is the ruined condition
        of men, who, being entirely divested of righteousness, are by nature all
        under sin. The charge of ‘ungodliness,’ and of consequent
        ‘unrighteousness,’ he proves first against the Gentiles. They had
        departed from the worship of God, although in the works of the visible
        creation they had sufficient notification of His power and Godhead. In
        their conduct they had violated the law written in their hearts, and had
        sinned in opposition to what they knew to be right, and to the testimony
        of their conscience in its favor. All of them, therefore, laws under the
        sentence of condemnation, which will be pronounced upon the workers of
        iniquity in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men. In the
        second chapter, a similar charge of transgression and guilt is
        established against the Jews, notwithstanding the superior advantage of
        a written revelation with which they had been favored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having proved in the first two chapters, by an appeal to undeniable
        facts, that the Gentiles and the Jews were both guilty before God, in
        the third chapter, after obviating some objections regarding the Jews,
        Paul takes both Jews and Gentiles together, and exhibits a fearful
        picture, drawn from the testimony of the Old Testament Scriptures, of
        the universal guilt and depravity of all mankind, showing that ‘there is
        none righteous, no, not one,’ and that all are depraved, wicked, and
        alienated from God. He thus establishes it as an undeniable truth, that
        every man in his natural state lies under the just condemnation of God,
        as a rebel against Him, in all the three ways in which He had been
        pleased to reveal Himself, whether by the works of creation, the work of
        the law written on the heart, or by the revelation of grace. From these
        premises he then draws the obvious and inevitable conclusion, that by
        obedience to law no man living shall be justified; that so far from
        justifying, the law proves every one to be guilty and under
        condemnation. The way is thus prepared for the grand display of the
        grace and mercy of God announced in the Gospel, by which men are saved
        consistently with the honor of the law. What the law could not do, not
        from any deficiency in itself, but owing to the depravity of man, God
        has fully accomplished. Man has no righteousness of his own which he can
        plead, but God has provided a righteousness for him. This righteousness,
        infinitely superior to that which he originally possessed, is provided
        solely by grace, and received solely by faith. It is placed to the
        account of the believer for his justification, without the smallest
        respect either to his previous or subsequent obedience. Yet so far from
        being contrary to the justice of God, this method of justification,
        ‘freely by His grace,’ strikingly illustrates His justice, and
        vindicates all His dealings to men. So far from making the law void, it
        establishes it in all its honor and authority. This way of salvation
        equally applies to all, both Jews and Gentiles — men of every nation and
        every character; ‘there is no difference,’ for all, without exception,
        are sinners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle, in the fourth chapter, dwells on the faith through which
        the righteousness of God is received, and, in obviating certain
        objections, further confirms and illustrates his doctrine, by showing
        that Abraham himself, the progenitor of the Jews, was justified not by
        works but by faith, and that in this way he was the father of all
        believers, the pattern and the type of the justification of both Jews
        and Gentiles. And in order to complete the view of the great subject of
        his discussion, Paul considers, in the fifth chapter, two principal
        effects of justification by Jesus Christ, namely, peace with God and
        assurance of salvation, notwithstanding the troubles and afflictions to
        which believers are exposed. And because Jesus Christ is the Author of
        this Divine reconciliation, he compares Him with Adam, who was the
        source of condemnation, concluding with a striking account of the
        entrance of sin and of righteousness, both of which he had been
        exhibiting. He next shows the reason why, between Adam and Jesus Christ,
        God caused the law of Moses to intervene, by means of which the extent
        of the evil of sin, and the efficiency of the remedy brought in by
        righteousness, were both fully exhibited, to the glory of the grace of
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        These five chapters disclose a consistent scheme in the Divine conduct,
        and exhibit a plan of reconciling sinners to God, that never could have
        been discovered by the human understanding. It is the perfection of
        wisdom, yet in all its features it is opposed to the wisdom of this
        world f1 .
      </p>
      <p>
        As the doctrine of the justification of sinners by the imputation of the
        righteousness of Christ, without regard to their works, which manifests,
        in all their extent, the guilt, the depravity, and the helplessness of
        man, in order to magnify grace in his pardon, might be charged with
        leading to licentiousness, Paul does not fail to state this objection;
        and solidly to refute it. This he does in the sixth and seventh
        chapters, in which he proves that, so far from setting aside the
        necessity of obedience to God, the doctrine of justification stands
        indissoluby connected with the very foundation of holiness and
        obedience. This foundation is union with the Redeemer, through that
        faith by which the believer is justified. On the contrary, the law
        operates, by its restraints, to stimulate and call into action the
        corruptions of the human heart, while at the same time it condemns all
        who are under its dominion. But, through their union with Christ,
        believers are delivered from the law; and, being under grace, which
        produces love, they are enabled to bring forth fruit acceptable to God.
        The law, however, is in itself holy, and just, and good. As such, it is
        employed by the Spirit of God to convince His people of sin, to teach
        them the value of the remedy provided in the Gospel, and to lead them to
        cleave unto the Lord, from a sense of the remaining corruption of their
        hearts. This corruption, as the Apostle shows, by a striking description
        of his own experience, will continue to exert its power in believers so
        long as they are in the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general conclusion from all that had gone before, the believer’s
        entire freedom from condemnation through union with his glorious Head,
        and his consequent sanctification, are both asserted in the eighth
        chapter, neither of which effects could have been accomplished by the
        law. The opposite results of death to the carnal mind, which actuated
        man in his natural state, and of life to the spiritual mind, which he
        receives in his renovation, are clearly pointed out; and as the love of
        God had been shown in the fifth chapter to be so peculiarly
        transcendent, from the consideration that Christ died for men, not as
        friends and worthy objects, but as ‘without strength,’ ‘ungodly,’
        ‘sinners,’ ‘enemies,’ so here the natural state of those on whom such
        unspeakable blessings are bestowed is described as ‘enmity against God.’
        The effects of the inhabitation of the Holy Spirit in those who are
        regenerated are next disclosed, together with the glorious privileges
        which it secures. Amidst present sufferings, the highest consolations
        are presented to the children of God, while their original source and
        final issue are pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contemplation of such ineffable blessings as he had just been
        describing, reminds the Apostle of the mournful state of the generality
        of his countrymen, who, though distinguished in the highest degree by
        their external privileges, still, as he himself had once done, rejected
        the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as the doctrine he had been inculcating seemed to set aside the
        promises which God had made to the Jewish people, and to take from them
        the Divine covenant under which they had been placed, Paul states that
        objection, and obviates it, in the ninth chapter, — showing that, on the
        one hand, the promises of spiritual blessings regarded only believers,
        who are the real Israelites, the true seed of Abraham; and, on the
        other, that faith itself being an effect of grace, God bestows it
        according to His sovereign will, so that the difference between
        believers and unbelievers is a consequence of His free election, of
        which the sole cause is His good pleasure, which He exercises both in
        regard to the Jews and the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing, then, had frustrated the purpose of God; and His word had taken
        effect so far as He had appointed. The doctrine of God’s sovereignty is
        here fully discussed; and that very objection which is daily made, ‘why
        doth He yet find fault,’ is stated, and for ever put down. Instead of
        national election, the great subject in this chapter is national
        rejection, and the personal election of a small remnant, without which
        the whole nation of Israel would have been destroyed; so devoid of
        reason is the objection usually made to the doctrine of election, that
        it is a cruel doctrine. In the end of the ninth chapter, the Apostle is
        led to the consideration of the fatal error of the great body of the
        Jews, who sought justification by works and not by faith. Mistaking the
        intent and the end of their law, they stumbled at this doctrine, which
        is the common stumbling-stone to unregenerate men.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the tenth chapter, Paul resumes the same subject, and by new proofs,
        drawn from the Old Testament, shows that the righteousness of God, which
        the Jews, going about to establish their own righteousness for their
        justification, rejected, is received solely by faith in Jesus Christ,
        and that the Gospel regards the Gentiles as well as the Jews; and if
        rejected by the Jews, it is not surprising, since this had been
        predicted by the prophets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews thus excluded themselves from salvation, not discerning the
        true character of the Messiah of Israel as the end of the law, and the
        Author of righteousness, to every believer. And yet, when they reflected
        on the declaration of Moses, that to obtain life by the law, the perfect
        obedience which it demands must in every case be yielded, they might
        have been convinced that on this ground they could not be justified; on
        the contrary, by the law they were universally condemned. The Apostle
        also exhibits the freeness of salvation through the Redeemer, and the
        certainty that all who accept it shall be saved. And since faith comes
        by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, the necessity of preaching
        the Gospel to the Gentiles is inferred and asserted. The result
        corresponded with the prediction. The righteousness which is by faith
        was received by the Gentiles, although they had not been inquiring for
        it; while the Jews, who followed after the law of righteousness, had not
        attained to righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mercies of God, as illustrated by the revelation of the
        righteousness which is received by faith, was the grand subject which
        had occupied Paul in the preceding part of this Epistle. He had
        announced at the beginning that he was ‘not ashamed of the Gospel of
        Christ; because it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
        believeth — to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.’ This great truth
        he had undertaken to demonstrate, and he had done so with and the
        authority and force of inspiration, by exhibiting, on the one hand, the
        state and character of man; and, on the other, the depth of the riches
        both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the prosecution of this subject, the Apostle had shown that the wrath
        of God is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men;
        and, by arguments the most irresistible, and evidence that could not be
        gainsaid, he had brought in both Jews and Gentiles as guilty and
        condemned sinners, justly obnoxious to the vengeance of Heaven. Had the
        Almighty been pleased to abandon the apostate race of Adam, as He did
        the angels, to perish in their sins, none could have impeached His
        justice, or arraigned the rigor of the Divine procedure. But in the
        unsearchable riches of the mercies of God, He was pleased to bring near
        a righteousness, by which His violated law should be magnified, and a
        multitude whom no man can number rescued from destruction. This
        righteousness is revealed in the Gospel, — a righteousness worthy of the
        source from which it flows, — a righteousness which shall for ever abase
        the pride of the creature, and bring glory to God in the highest. The
        mercies of God are thus dispensed in such a way as to cut off all ground
        for boasting on the part of those who are justified. They are, on the
        contrary, calculated to exalt the Divine sovereignty, and to humble
        those in the dust who are saved before Him who worketh all things
        according to the counsel of His own will, and, without giving any
        account of His matters, either justifies or condemns the guilty
        according to His supreme pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eleventh chapter, the Apostle finishes his argument, and in a
        manner concludes his subject. He here resumes the doctrine of the
        personal election of a remnant of Israel, of which he had spoken in the
        ninth chapter, and affirms, in the most express terms, that it is wholly
        of grace, which consequently excludes as its cause every idea of work,
        or of merit, on the part of man. He shows that the unbelief of the Jews
        has not been universal, God having still reserved some of them by His
        gratuitous election, while as a nation He has allowed them to fall; and
        that this fall has been appointed, in the wise providence of God, to
        open the way for the calling of the Gentiles. But in order that the
        Gentiles may not triumph over that outcast nation, Paul predicts that
        God will one day raise it up again, and recall the whole of it to
        communion with Himself. He vindicates God’s dealings both towards Jews
        and Gentiles, showing that, since all were guilty and justly condemned,
        God was acting on a plan by which, both in the choice and partial
        rejection, as well as in the final restoration of the Jews, the Divine
        glory would be manifested, while in the result, the sovereign mercies of
        Jehovah would shine forth conspicuous in all His dealings toward the
        children of men. A most consolatory view is accordingly given of the
        present tendency and final issue of the dispensations of God, in
        bringing in the fullness of the Gentiles, and in the general salvation
        of Israel. And thus, also, by the annunciation of the reception which
        the Gospel should meet with from the Jews, first in Rejecting it for a
        long period, and afterwards in embracing it, the doctrine of the
        sovereignty of Him who hath mercy on whom He will have mercy, and
        hardeneth whom He will, is further displayed and established. Lost in
        admiration of the majesty of God, as discovered in the Gospel, the
        Apostle prostrates himself before his Maker, while, in language of
        adoring wonder, he summons all whom he addresses to unite in ascribing
        glory to Him who is the first and the last, the beginning and the end,
        the Almighty.

        From this point, Paul turns to survey the practical results which
        naturally flow from the doctrine he had been illustrating. He was
        addressing those who were at Rome, ‘beloved of God, called saints;’ and
        by the remembrance of those mercies of which, whether Jews or Gentiles,
        they were the monuments, he beseeches them to present their bodies a
        living sacrifice to God, whose glory is the first and the last end of
        creation. In thus demanding the entire surrender or sacrifice of their
        bodies, he enforces the duty by designating it their reasonable service.
        Nothing can be more agreeable to the dictates of right reason, than to
        spend and be spent in the service of that God, whose glory is
        transcendent, whose power is infinite, whose justice is inviolable, and
        whose tender mercies are over all His works. On this firm foundation the
        Apostle establishes the various duties to which men are called, as
        associated with each other in society, whether in the ordinary relations
        of life, or as subjects of civil government, or as members of the Church
        of Christ. The morality here inculcated is the purest and most exalted.
        It presents nothing of that incongruous medley which is discernible in
        the schemes of philosophy. It exhibits no traces of confusion or
        disorder. It places everything on its right basis, and in its proper
        place. It equally enjoins our duty towards God and our duty towards man;
        and in this it differs from all human systems, which uniformly exclude
        the former, or keep it in the background. It shows how doctrine and
        practice are inseparably connected — how the one is the motive, the
        source, or the principle — how the other is the effect; and how both are
        so united, that such as is the first, so will be the last. According to
        our views of the character of God, so will be our conduct. The
        corruption of morals, which degraded and destroyed the heathen world,
        was the natural result of what infidels have designated ‘their elegant
        mythology.’

        The abominable character of the heathen gods and goddesses were at once
        the transcript and the provocatives of the abominations of their
        worshippers. But wherever the true God has been known, wherever the
        character of Jehovah has been proclaimed, there a new standard of morals
        has been erected; and even those by whom His salvation is rejected are
        induced to counterfeit the virtues to which they do not attain. True
        Christianity and sound morals are indissolubly linked together; and just
        in proportion as men are estranged from the knowledge and service of
        God, so shall we find their actions stained with the corruptions of sin.

        Where in all the boasted moral systems of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,
        Cicero, Epictetus, Seneca, or the rest of the Greek and Roman
        philosophers, shall be found anything comparable to the purity and
        beauty of the virtues enjoined by Paul in the closing chapters of this
        Epistle? Even modern writers on Ethics, when departing from the only
        pure standard of virtue, discover the grossest ignorance and
        inconsistency.

        But Paul, writing without any of the aids of human wisdom, draws his
        precepts from the fountain of heavenly truth, and inculcates on the
        disciples of Jesus a code of duties, which, if habitually practiced by
        mankind, would change the world from what it is a scene of strife,
        jealousy, and division — and make it what it was before the entrance of
        sin, a paradise fit for the Lord to visit, and for man to dwell in.
