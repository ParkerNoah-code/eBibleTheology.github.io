      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        THIS chapter consists of three parts. The first part extends to the 8th
        verse inclusively, and is designed to answer and remove some objections
        to the doctrine previously advanced by the Apostle. In the second part,
        from the 9th to the 20th verses, it is proved, by the testimonies of
        various scriptures, that the Jews, as well as the Gentiles, are involved
        in sin and guilt, and consequently that none can be justified by the
        law. The third part commences at verse 21, where the Apostle reverts to
        the declaration, ch. 1:17, with which his discussion commenced, and
        exhibits the true and only way of justification for all men, by the
        righteousness of God imputed through faith in Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1 — What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
        circumcision?
      </p>
      <p>
        If the preceding doctrine be true, it may be asked, What advantage hath
        the Jew over the Gentile; and what profit is there in circumcision, if
        it does not save from sin? If, on the contrary, the Jews, on account of
        their superior privileges, will be held more culpable before the
        tribunal of Divine justice, as the Apostle had just shown, it appears
        obviously improper to allege that God has favored them more than the
        Gentiles. This objection it was necessary to obviate, not only because
        it is specious, but because it is important, and might, in regard to the
        Jews, arrest the course of the Gospel. It is specious; for if, in truth,
        the advantages of the Jews, so far from justifying them, contribute
        nothing to cause the balance of Divine judgment to preponderate in their
        favor — if their advantages rather enhance their condemnation — does it
        not appear that they are not only useless, but positively pernicious? In
        these advantages, then, it is impossible to repose confidence. But the
        objection is also important; for it would be difficult to imagine that
        all God had done for the Jews — His care of them so peculiar, and His
        love of them so great, — in short, all the privileges which Moses exalts
        so highly — were lavished on them in vain, or turned to their
        disadvantage. The previous statement of the Apostle might then be
        injurious to the doctrine of the Gospel, by rendering him more odious in
        the eyes of his countrymen, and therefore he had good reasons for fully
        encountering and answering this objection. In a similar way, it is still
        asked by carnal professors of Christianity, Of what use is obedience to
        the law of God or the observance of His ordinances, if they do not save
        the soul, or contribute somewhat to this end?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — Much every way; chiefly, because that unto them were committed
        the oracles of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here repels the foregoing objection as false and unfounded.
        Although the privileges of the Jews cannot come into consideration for
        their justification before the judgment-seat of God, it does not follow
        that they were as nothing, or of no advantage; on the contrary, they
        were marks of the peculiar care of God for that people, while He had, as
        it were, abandoned all the other nations. They were as aids, too, which
        God had given to deliver them from the impiety and depravity of the
        Gentiles; and, by the accompanying influences of His Spirit, they were
        made effectual to the salvation of many of them. Finally, the revelation
        made to the Jews contained not only figures and shadows of the Gospel,
        but also preparations for the new covenant. God had bestowed nothing
        similar on the Gentiles: the advantage, then, of the Jews was great.
        Much every way. — This does not mean, in every sense; for the Apostle
        does not retract what he had said in the preceding chapter, namely, that
        their advantages were of no avail for justification to the Jews
        continuing to be sinners, — for, on the contrary, in that case they only
        enhanced their condemnation; but this expression signifies that their
        advantages were very great, and very considerable. Chiefly, because that
        unto them were committed the oracles of God. — The original denotes
        primarily , which is not a priority of order, but a priority in dignity
        and advantage; that is to say, that of all the advantages God had
        vouchsafed to them, the most estimable and most excellent was that of
        having entrusted to them His oracles. The word here used for oracles
        signifies the responses or answers given by an oracle; and when the
        Scriptures are so designated, it implies that they are altogether, in
        word, as well as in sense, the communications of God. By these oracles
        we must understand, in general, all the Scriptures of the Old Testament,
        especially as they regarded the Messiah; and, in particular, the
        prophecies which predicted His advent. They were oracles, inasmuch as
        they were the words from the mouth of God Himself, in opposition to the
        revelation of nature, which was common to Jews and Gentiles; and they
        were promises in respect to their matter, because they contained the
        great promise of sending Jesus Christ into the world. God had entrusted
        these oracles to the Jews, who had been constituted their guardians and
        depositories till the time of their fulfillment, when they were to be
        communicated to all, Isaiah 2:3; and through them possessed the high
        character of the witnesses of God, Isaiah 43:10, 44:8, even till the
        time of their execution, when they were commanded to be communicated to
        the whole world, according to what Isaiah 2:3, had said, — ’For out of
        Sin shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
        These oracles had not, however, been entrusted to the Jews simply as
        good things for the benefit of others, but also for their own advantage,
        that they might themselves make use of them; for in the oracles the
        Messiah — who was to be born among them, and among them to accomplish
        the work of redemption — was declared to be the proper object of their
        confidence, and through them they had the means of becoming acquainted
        with the way of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why were these oracles given so long before the coming of the
        Messiah? It was for three principal reasons: — First , To serve as a
        testimony that, notwithstanding man’s apostasy, God had not abandoned
        the earth, but had always reserved for Himself a people; and it was by
        these great and Divine promises that He had preserved His elect in all
        ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, These oracles were to characterize and designate the Messiah
        when He should come, in order that He might be known and distinguished;
        for they pointed Him out in such a manner that He could be certainly
        recognized when He appeared. On this account Philip said to Nathaniel,
        John 1:45, ‘We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the
        Prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph’ Thirdly ,
        They were to serve as a proof of the Divine origin of the Christian
        religion; for the admirable correspondence between the Old Testament and
        the New is a clear and palpable demonstration of its divinity. It is,
        moreover, to be observed that this favor of having been constituted the
        depositories of the sacred oracles was peculiar to the Jews, and one in
        which the Gentiles did not at all participate. This is what the Apostle
        here expressly teaches, since he considers it as an illustrious
        distinction conferred upon his nation, a pre-eminence over all the
        kingdoms of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why, again, does the Apostle account the possession of these oracles
        their greatest advantage? Might not other privileges have been
        considered as equal, or even preferable, such as the glorious miracles
        which God had wrought for the deliverance of the Israelites; His causing
        them to pass through the Red Sea, in the face of all the pride and power
        of their haughty oppressor; His guiding them through the sandy desert by
        a pillar of fire by night, and of cloud by day; His causing them to hear
        His voice out of the fire, when He descended in awful majesty upon
        Sinai; or, finally, His giving them His law, written with His own
        finger, on tables of stone? It is replied, the promises respecting the
        Messiah, and His coming to redeem men, were much greater than all the
        others. Apart from these, all the other advantages would not only have
        been useless, but fatal to the Jews; for, being sinners, they could only
        have served to overwhelm them with despair, in discovering, on the one
        hand, their corruption, unmitigated by the kindness of Jehovah, and, on
        the other, the avenging justice of God. In these circumstances, they
        would have been left under the awful impossibility of finding any
        expiation for their sins. If, then, God had not added the promises
        concerning the Messiah, all the rest would have been death to them, and
        therefore the oracles which contained these promises were the first and
        chief of their privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make
        the faith of God without effect?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not the objection of a Jew, but, as it might readily occur, is
        supposed by the Apostle. It is not ‘But what,’ as Dr. Macknight
        translates the first words, it is ‘For that.’ The Apostle answers the
        objection in stating it. ‘For what if some have not believed;’ that is,
        ‘the unbelief of some is no objection to my doctrine.’ ‘Will their
        unbelief destroy the faithfulness of God?’ This repels, and does not, as
        Dr. Macknight understands it, assert the supposition. The meaning is,
        that the unbelief of the Jews did not make void God’s faithfulness with
        respect to the covenant with Abraham. Though the mass of his descendants
        were unbelievers at this time, yet many of them, both then, as the
        Apostle asserts, ch. 11:2, and at all other times, were saved in virtue
        of that covenant. Paul, then, here anticipates and meets an objection
        which might be urged against his assertion of the pre-eminence of the
        Jews over the Gentiles, testified by the fact that to them God had
        confided His oracles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objection is this, that since they had not believed in the Messiah,
        whom these oracles promised, this advantage must not only be reckoned of
        little value, but, on the contrary, prejudicial.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reply to this objection, the Apostle, in the first place, intimates
        that their unbelief had not been universal, which is tacitly understood
        in his only attributing unbelief to some; for when it is said that some
        have not believed, it is plainly intimated that some have believed. It
        does not, indeed, appear that it would have been worthy of the Divine
        wisdom to have given to one nation, in preference to all others, so
        excellent and glorious an economy as that of the Old Testament, to have
        chosen them above all others of His free love and good pleasure, and to
        have revealed to them the mysteries respecting the Messiah, while, at
        the same time, none of them should have responded to all this by a true
        faith. There is too much glory and too much majesty in the person of
        Jesus Christ, and in His work of redemption, to allow it to be supposed
        that He should be revealed only externally by the word, without profit
        to some, Isaiah 55:10,11.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all ages, before as well as since the coming of the Messiah, although
        in a different measure, the Gospel has been the ministration of the
        Spirit. It was fitting, then, that the ancient promises, which were in
        substance the Gospel, should be accompanied with a measure of that
        Divine Spirit who imprints them in the hearts of men, and that, as the
        Spirit was to be poured out on all flesh, the nation of the Jews should
        not be absolutely deprived of this blessing. This was the first answer,
        namely, that unbelief had not been so general, but that many had
        profited by the Divine oracles; and consequently, in respect to them at
        least, the advantage to the Jews had been great. But the Apostle goes
        farther; for, in the second place, he admits that many had fallen in
        incredulity, but denies that their incredulity impeached the
        faithfulness of God. Here it may be asked whether the Apostle refers to
        the Jews under the legal economy who did not believe the Scriptures, or
        to those only who, at the appearing of the Messiah, rejected the Gospel?
        The reference, it may be answered, is both to the one and the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it may be said, How could unbelief respecting these oracles be
        ascribed to the Jews, when they had only rejected the person of Jesus
        Christ? For they did not doubt the truth of the oracles; on the
        contrary, they expected with confidence their accomplishment; they only
        denied that Jesus was the predicted Messiah. It is replied, that to
        reject, as they did, the person of Jesus Christ, was the same as if they
        had formally rejected the oracles themselves, since all that was
        contained in them could only unite and be accomplished in His person.
        The Jews, therefore, in reality rejected the oracles; and so much the
        more was their guilt aggravated, inasmuch as it was their prejudices,
        and their carnal and unauthorized anticipations of a temporal Messiah,
        which caused their rejection of Jesus Christ. Thus it was a real
        disbelief of the oracles themselves; for all who reject the true meaning
        of the Scriptures, and attach to them another sense, do in reality
        disbelieve them, and set up in their stead a phantom of their own
        imagination, even while they profess to believe the truth of what the
        Scriptures contain. The Apostle, then, had good reason to attribute
        unbelief to the Jews respecting the oracles, but he denies that their
        unbelief can make void the faith, or rather destroy the faithfulness, of
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the faithfulness of God some understand the constancy and
        faithfulness of His love to the Jews; and they suppose that the meaning
        is, that while the Jews have at present fallen into unbelief, God will
        not, however, fail to recall them, as is fully taught in the eleventh
        chapter. But the question here is not respecting the recall of the Jews,
        or the constancy of God’s love to them, but respecting their
        condemnation before His tribunal of strict justice, which they attempted
        to elude by producing these advantages, and in maintaining that if these
        advantages only led to their condemnation, as the Apostle had said, it
        was not in sincerity that God had conferred them. ‘This objection alone
        the Apostle here refutes. The term, then, faith of God, signifies His
        sincerity or faithfulness, according to which He had given to the Jews
        these oracles; and the Apostle’s meaning is, that the incredulity of the
        Jews did not impeach that sincerity and faithfulness, whence it followed
        that it drew down on them a more just condemnation, as he had shown in
        the preceding chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — God forbid: yea, let and be true, but every man a liar; as it
        is written, that Thou might be justified in Thy sayings, and might
        overcome when Thou art judged.
      </p>
      <p>
        God forbid. — Literally, let it not be, or far be it, a denial
        frequently made by the Apostle in the same way in this Epistle. It
        intimates two things, namely, the rejecting of that which the objection
        would infer, not only as what is false, but even impious; for it is an
        affront to God to make His faithfulness dependent on the depravity of
        man, and His favor on our corruption. Though the privileges of the Jew,
        and the good which God had done for him, terminated only in his
        condemnation, by reason of his unbelief, it would be derogatory to the
        Almighty to question His faithfulness, because of the fault of the
        unprincipled objects of these privileges. The Apostle also wished to
        clear his doctrine from this calumny, that God was unfaithful in His
        promises, and insincere in His proceedings. Let God be true, but every
        man a liar. — The calling of men, inasmuch as it is of God, is faithful
        and sincere; but the fact that it produces a result contrary to its
        nature and tendency, is to he attributed to man, who is always deceitful
        and vain. If the Jews had not been corrupted by their perversity, their
        calling would have issued in salvation; if it has turned to their
        condemnation, this is to be attributed to their own unbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must therefore always distinguish between what comes from God and
        what proceeds from man: that which is from God is good, and right, and
        true; that which is from man is evil, and false, and deceitful. Mr.
        Tholuck grievously errs in his Neological supposition, that this
        inspired Apostle ‘utters, in the warmth of his discourse, the wish that
        all mankind might prove covenant-breakers, as this would only tend to
        glorify God the more, by being the occasion of manifesting how great is
        His fidelity.’ This would be a bad wish; it would be desiring evil that
        good might come. It is not a wish. Paul states a truth. God in every
        instance is to be believed, although this should imply that every man on
        earth is to be condemned as a liar. As it is written, That thou mightest
        be justified in Thy sayings, and mightest overcome when Thou art judged.
        — This passage may be taken either in a passive signification, when Thou
        shalt be judged, or in an active signification, when Thou shalt judge.
        In this latter sense, according to the translation in Psalm 51:4, the
        meaning will be clear, if we have recourse to the history referred to in
        the Second Book of Samuel, ch. 12:7, 11, where it is said that Nathan
        was sent from God to David. In that address, God assumed two characters,
        the one, of the party complaining and accusing David as an ungrateful
        man, who had abused the favors he had received, and who had offended his
        benefactor; the other, of the judge who pronounces in his own cause,
        according to his own accusation. It is to this David answers, in the 4th
        verse of the Psalm: — ’Against thee, Thee only have I sinned, and done
        this evil in Thy sight, that Thou mightest be justified when thou
        speakest.’ As if he had said, Thou hast good cause to decide against me;
        I have offended Thee; I am ungrateful; Thou hast reason to complain and
        to accuse me; Thou hast truth and justice in the words which Thy prophet
        has spoken from Thee. He adds, that Thou mightest be clear when Thou
        judgest; that is to say, as my accuser Thou wilt obtain the victory over
        me, before Thy tribunal, when Thou pronouncest Thy sentence. In one
        word, it signifies that whether in regard to the found of that sentence
        or its form, David had nothing to allege against the judgment which God
        had pronounced in His own cause, and that he fully acknowledged the
        truth and justice of God. Hence it clearly follow that when God pleads
        against us, and sets before us His goodness to us, and, on the other
        hand, the evil return we have made, it is always found that God is
        sincere and true towards us, but that we have been deceivers and
        unbelieving in regard to Him, and therefore that our condemnation is
        juSt. This is precisely what the Apostle proposed to conclude against
        the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
        God had extended to them His favors, and they had requited them only by
        their sins, and by a base incredulity. When, therefore, He shall bring
        them to answer before His judgment-seat, God will decide that He had
        been sincere in respect to them, and that they, on the contrary, had
        been wicked, whence will follow their awful but just condemnation. Paul
        could not have adduced anything more to the purpose than the example and
        words of David on a subject altogether similar, nor more solidly have
        replied to the objection supposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer of the Apostle will lead to the same conclusion, if the
        passive sense be taken, Thou shalt be judged. Though so eminent a
        servant of God, David had been permitted to fall into his foul
        transgressions, that God might be justified in the declarations of His
        word, which assert that all men are evil, guilty and polluted by nature,
        and that in themselves there is no difference. Had all the eminent
        saints whose lives are recorded in Scripture, been preserved blameless,
        the world would have supposed that such men were an exception to the
        character given of man in the word of God. They would have concluded
        that human nature is better than it is. But when Abraham and Jacob,
        David and Solomon, and Peter and many others, were permitted to manifest
        what is in human nature, God’s word is justified in its description of
        man. God ‘overcomes when He is judged;’ that is, such examples as that
        of the fall of David prove that man is what God declares him to be.
        Wicked men are not afraid to bring God to their bar, and impeach His
        veracity, by denying that man is as bad as He declares. But by such
        examples God is justified. The passive sense, then, of the word ‘judge’
        is a good and appropriate meaning; and the phrase acquitting, or
        clearing, or overcoming may be applicable, not to the person who judges
        God, but to God who is judged. This meaning is also entirely to the
        Apostle’s purpose. Let all men be accounted liars, rather than impugn
        the veracity of God, because, in reality, all men are in themselves
        such.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever, then, the Divine testimony is contradicted by human testimony,
        let man be accounted a liar.
