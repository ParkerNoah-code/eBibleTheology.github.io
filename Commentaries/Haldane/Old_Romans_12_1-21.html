      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 12:1-21</p>
      <p>
        HERE we enter on the second division of this Epistle, where Paul,
        according to his accustomed method, enforces the duties of believers, by
        arguments dependent on his previous exhibition of the grand and
        influential doctrines of the Gospel. These doctrines, as well as all the
        commandments of God, may be summed up in one word, namely, in\parLOVE.
        By the view which they present of the goodness, the forbearance, and the
        long-suffering of God, believers are daily led to repentance, while the
        contemplation of the Divine compassion and philanthropy is calculated to
        beget reciprocal confidence and child-like affection. ‘We have known and
        believed,’ says the Apostle John, ‘the love that God hath to us.’ ‘We
        love Him because He first loved us.’ This love of God does not exclude
        reverential fear and filial devotion; of which, on the contrary, it is
        the principle and the foundation — while both together unite in the
        spirit of adoption to inspire the cry, ‘Abba, Father!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that
        ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
        which is your reasonable service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brethren. — The Apostle addresses the believers at Rome as his brethren,
        as standing on the same level with himself regarding acceptance with
        God. I beseech you. — We may here remark the difference between the
        endearing manner of address often used by inspired Apostles, and the
        haughty, overbearing tone of Popish antichristian tyranny. Those whose
        authority was avouched by mighty signs and wonders, whose very word was
        command, strive frequently to express commands as entreaties. Therefore.
        — This may have reference to what had been said in the foregoing chapter
        respecting the Gentiles and the Jewish nation in general, to whom, as
        being part of the elect remnants, some of those addressed belonged; or
        rather, as he now enters on the second division of the Epistle, Paul
        here refers to those grand doctrines of the Gospel which, in the
        preceding part of it, he had been unfolding, denominating the whole of
        them, as forming together the great plan of salvation, the mercies of
        God. By the mercies of God. — The word mercies or compassions is here
        used in the plural number, because it refers to the different instances
        before enumerated of Divine compassion. In the foregoing chapter, the
        Apostle had been declaring the mercies of God in the calling and
        restoration both of the Gentiles and the Jews, verse 31. But the whole
        of his preceding discourse contained a most striking and encouraging
        display of the mercies of God to all believers, in their election and
        predestination to eternal life, their calling, their deliverance from
        condemnation, their justification, their union with the Lord Jesus
        Christ, and communion with God, with the enjoyment of all the
        unspeakable blessings of the new covenant. Christians are here urged to
        devote themselves to the service of God by the consideration of these
        mercies because they present the strongest motives to obedience. How
        different is the mind of the Apostle from the mind of the world on this
        subject! The wisdom of this world rejects the grace of the Gospel,
        because it is thought to lead to licentiousness. The interests of
        morality are supposed to be better secured when salvation is suspended
        on men’s good works, than when it is represented as flowing from the
        Divine compassion. But Paul presents the mercies of God to the mind of
        believers, as the most powerful incitement to devote themselves to His
        service. In the remainder of the Epistle, we find him as strenuous in
        pressing the duty of holiness and personal obedience, as in the previous
        part of it, in insisting on those truths on which obedience is founded.
        This ought to convince of their error those who, misunderstanding the
        doctrine which the Apostle teaches, imagine that it is inconsistent with
        attention to the peculiar duties of Christianity. It will, however, be
        seen that the persons who seem to fear that his doctrine tends to
        licentiousness, are equally opposed to the strictness of his precepts,
        the observance of which they speak of as impracticable. That represent
        your bodies. — There is no necessity, with Mr. Stuart and the majority
        of commentators, to understand the term ‘bodies’ as denoting both soul
        and body. It is of the body that the Apostle here speaks, and it is not
        proper to extract out of his language more than it contains. The
        expression evidently makes a distinction between themselves and their
        bodies. Those addressed are entreated to present their bodies, and the
        body is here considered as the sacrifice. This, indeed, cannot be done
        without the soul, yet this is not the thing expressed. This shows the
        importance of serving God with the body as well as with the soul. Every
        member of the body is to be employed in the service of God. Many, when
        they use their members sinfully, attempt to excuse themselves, and found
        a plea for pardon, by alleging that they have a good heart. But we see
        from this passage that God requires the service of the body as well as
        that of the mind. Besides, an exclusive reference to the body comports
        better with the figure of offering a sacrifice. The apostle seems to
        summon attention peculiarly to our actions or outward deportment, which
        are of so great importance to the Christian life. But, in addition to
        this, if we extend the expression further, and include in it the whole
        man, we lose the beauty of the connection in the 2nd verse, which
        relates particularly, and likewise exclusively, to the state and frame
        of the mind. Sacrifice. — This term is used figuratively. It intimates
        that there are now no proper sacrifices. The sacrifice of Jesus on the
        cross has put an end to sacrifices. The sacrifice of the mass, then, is
        an invention of man, and an abomination to God. It is also observable
        that even figuratively it is not the Lord’s Supper, but the service of
        the body, that is here called a sacrifice. The phraseology that
        afterward prevailed, by which the table whereon the bread and wine were
        placed was called the altar, has no countenance in the word of God, even
        as a figure of speech. Living sacrifice. — This is called a living
        sacrifice, in distinction from the sacrifices of the law, in which the
        animal offered was put to death. The phraseology is quite similar to the
        phrases living bread and living way. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight, then, entirely errs when he explains the phrase as signifying
        ‘an excellent sacrifice,’ from the circumstance that animals were
        brought alive to the altar. Formerly those believers thus called on to
        offer their bodies a living sacrifice were dead in trespasses and sins,
        and had yielded their members as servants to iniquity; but now they were
        quickened, and risen with Christ, to walk in newness of life. And as the
        sacrifices were wholly devoted to God, so believers ought to be wholly
        consecrated to His service, preserving their bodies pure as temples of
        the Holy Ghost, and remembering that they themselves are living stones,
        built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
        sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Holy. — It was necessary
        that the sacrifices of the law should be holy, or free from everything
        that would render them ceremonially unclean. In like manner, the bodies
        of the saints must be holy as well as their souls. They must not be
        employed in the service of sin, else they cannot be fit to be presented
        to the Lord. Acceptable unto God. — The Jewish sacrifices, even if
        offered according to the law, now ceased to be acceptable to God, since
        they were abolished by the coming of their antitype, the lamb of God.
        But the preparation of the bodies of believers is a service that is
        always well pleasing to God. This and other such things as are obviously
        appointed are the only sacrifices acceptable to God. The sacrifice of
        the mass not being appointed by God, and actually subversive of the
        sacrifice of the cross, instead of being agreeable to God, must be
        odious in His sight. Your reasonable service. — This evidently refers to
        the distinction between the service of the Jews by sacrifices and
        ceremonial worship, and the service of Christians. Sacrificial worship,
        and, in general, the whole ceremonial ritual of the Jews, were not
        worship according to reason. It is, indeed, reasonable to worship God in
        whatever way He prescribes; but had not man fallen, he would not have
        been required to worship by such ceremonies as the Jewish law enjoined.
        Sacrificial worship is not in itself rational, and was appointed by God
        not for its own excellence, but from its adaptation to prefigure the
        good things to come. Many commentators appear to have mistaken the true
        meaning of this phrase, from an ill-grounded fear that it is
        disrespectful to the Divine appointments to suppose that they are not in
        themselves rational. This, however, is an important and obvious truth.
        Sacrificial service was appointed only as a shadow, and when abolished,
        is classed by the Apostle among ‘the weak and beggarly elements.’ But to
        worship God with our bodies is as rational as to worship Him with our
        souls. Such worship, then, is called reasonable worship or service, as
        distinguished from the Jewish ritual. Mr. Locke imagines that it is
        opposed to the irrational worship of the heathen. But to this the
        contrast is not exclusively confined; for it is evident that the
        sacrifices of the pagans were of the same kind as those of the Jews. If
        the nature of the one kind of sacrifices was irrational, so also must be
        the other. The difference between the heathen sacrifices and those of
        the Jews did not consist in the things offered, but in the object of the
        offerings. The one was appointed of God, and was accepted of God: the
        other was not only not appointed by God, but was an act of homage to
        devils. Agreeably to this view, it may be asserted with the utmost
        confidence, that sacrifices are of Divine appointment, and not an
        invention of men. They are not in themselves rational, and no abuse of
        reason would have led to such a practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by
        the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
        acceptable, and perfect will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And be not conformed to this world. — ’ World’ here denotes the people
        or inhabitants of the world. But there is no allusion, as Dr. Macknight
        supposes, to the heathen world. The same exhortation is as applicable to
        men in every age, even since so large a portion of the world has assumed
        the name of Christian, as it was to the pagan Roman empire. The wicked
        are called the world, not, as Dr. Macknight imagines, as the whole is
        put for a part, but on the principle that the righteous are
        comparatively so few. As the nation of Israel was so small in number as
        not to be counted among the nations, so are the people of God among the
        inhabitants of the earth. They are not counted in the world. ‘We know,’
        says the Apostle John, ‘that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
        wickedness.’ By conformity to the world is meant assimilation to the
        people of the world; or the sentiments, conduct, and customs by which
        they are distinguished.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the character of those who are dead in trespasses and sins, that
        they walk ‘according to the course of this world,’ acting conformably to
        those maxims which regard only the present life; and they ‘who mind
        earthly things’ are described as the enemies of the cross of Christ; but
        the conversation of believers, as being pilgrims and strangers, is in
        heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        This prohibition, however, respects those things only that are sinful,
        and does not require singularity in the Christian in anything that is
        not contrary to the law of Christ. Pride may be indulged in the
        singularities of austerity, as well as in the imitation of fashionable
        folly. A sound Christian mind will have no difficulty in making the
        necessary discrimination on this subject. Transformed. — This word
        signifies the change of the appearance of one thing into that of
        another. It is used by the fabulous writers to signify the change or
        metempsychosis of animals into trees, or of men into the appearance of
        other animals. This term denotes the entire change that passes on a man
        when he becomes a Christian. He is as different from what he was before,
        as one species of animal is from another. Let not men be so far the
        dupes of self-deception as to reckon themselves Christians, while they
        are unchanged in heart and life. ‘If any man be in Christ, he is a new
        creature (or creation); old things are passed away, behold, all things
        are become new.’ If there be not a radical difference between their
        present state and that in which they were by nature, they have no title
        to the character of Christians. This shows that, in general, it is not
        difficult to discriminate Christians from the world. If the change be as
        great as the word of God here teaches, what difficulty can there be, in
        most cases, in judging of the character of those who profess
        Christianity? It is not the heart we are called to judge. If the person
        be metamorphosed, as the word originally implies, from a state of nature
        to a conformity with Christ, it will certainly appear, and the state of
        the heart will be evident from the life. As there are degrees in this
        transformation, although all Christians are transformed when they are
        born again, yet they ought to be urged, as here, to a further degree of
        this transformation. Renewing of your mind . — It is not the conduct
        merely, but the heart itself, of the Christian that is changed; and it
        is from the renewal of the mind that the conduct is also renewed. The
        transformation or change that passes on the man who becomes a believer
        of the Gospel, is not one produced by enthusiastically imaginations,
        monkish austerity, or a spirit of legalism, endeavoring to attain
        salvation by good works. It is produced by the renewing of the mind, and
        by that only. Many persons become for a time changed in conduct from
        various motives, who are not changed in heart by the Spirit of God, and
        the truth believed respecting the person and work of the Lord Jesus
        Christ. But such changes are generally temporary, and though they should
        continue for life, they are of no value in the sight of God. That change
        of life which the Lord will approve, is a change produced by the
        renovation of the mind, in the understanding, the affections, and the
        will. That ye may prove. The word in the original signifies both to
        prove and to approved, but we cannot so properly say approve what is the
        will of God. The passage seems to assert that to find out and
        discriminate the will of God with respect to those things that He
        requires and forbids, it is necessary to be renewed in the mind. Calvin
        well remarks, ‘If the renewal of our mind is necessary for the purpose
        of proving what the will of the Most High is, we may hence see how much
        this mind is opposed to God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, nothing can be more true than that these renewal of the mind is
        necessary for a successful inquiry into every part of the will of God.
        The natural man is in everything opposed to the mind of God. Good — The
        will of God is here distinguished as good; because, however much the
        mind may be opposed to it, and how much soever we may think that it
        curtails our pleasures, and mars our enjoyments, obedience to God
        conduces to our happiness. To follow His law is even in this world
        calculated to promote happiness. Acceptable. — That which the Lord
        enjoins is acceptable to Him, and surely this is the strongest motive to
        practice it. Nothing else is acceptable to Him, however specious it may
        appear to human wisdom. All injunctions that proceed merely from men in
        Divine things are unacceptable to God. He approves of nothing but
        obedience to His own commands. All the injunctions, then, that men
        submit to, in obedience to the mandates of the Church of Rome, are
        unacceptable to God. They are abomination in His sight. Perfect will of
        God. — The will of God as exhibited in His word is perfect. Nothing can
        be added to it, nothing can be taken from it; yet that monstrous system
        of Antichristianity which has so long, in the name of Christ, lorded it
        over the world, has added innumerable commands to those of Christ, and
        even taken away many of His laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
        is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
        think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man
        the measure of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        For appears to indicate the reason why those who were addressed should
        in all things ascertain the will of God. By introducing a particular
        instance of the importance of this duty, Paul enjoins the necessity of
        giving heed to his exhortation. It is the will of God that His people
        should make a just estimate of their own gifts, and not from ignorance
        overvalue themselves and despise others. I say, by the grace given unto
        me. — Although Paul sometimes addresses believers, as in the beginning
        of this chapter, in the humblest and most affectionate style, yet at
        other times, as in these words, he employs that tone of authority which
        was the prerogative of an Apostle. He calls on them to attend to his
        words, as remembering that he did not speak of himself; but, as he
        elsewhere expresses it, ‘as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in
        Christ.’ The grace given unto me. — This grace or favor bestowed upon
        Paul, is the of force of an Apostle. But it is not correct to say that
        grace in this place signifies apostleship. The apostleship was a grace
        or favor; but favor or grace is not apostleship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grace or favor includes, but by no means signifies, that office,
        although it is one of the innumerable gifts conferred by grace. To
        explain grace as signifying office, as is often done, is an instance of
        that unsound criticism that makes a word specifically designate whatever
        its general meaning includes, which, though in this instance it may be
        harmless is productive of much false interpretation. To every man that
        is among you. — The Epistle was addressed to all in the church at Rome,
        and consequently they were all included in the exhortation that follows.
        When, therefore, the Apostle addresses them here individually, it shows
        that the dissuasive refers to a thing to which all of them were
        naturally much inclined. With this, fact corresponds. All men are prone
        to overvalue themselves; and therefore to each of them Paul thus
        pointedly brings home the exhortation. Not to think of himself more
        highly than he ought to think. — In the two foregoing verses the Apostle
        had been enjoining the duty of entire devotedness to God, both in body
        and soul. Nothing could tend more powerfully to render his exhortation
        ineffectual, or stand more in the way of the performance of those duties
        on which, in the following part of the Epistle, he was about to
        expatiate, than high-mindedness in those whom he addressed. According,
        therefore, to the example of our Lord, both in His Sermon on the Mount,
        and when inviting sinners to come to Him, Paul begins here by
        inculcating humility. He warns each of them not to form a higher opinion
        of himself than his faith in God warranted. To this all are naturally
        prone; but there is an opposite error, assuming the semblance of
        obedience to this exhortation, which ought equally to be avoided. This
        is an affectation of humility by speaking of one’s self contemptuously.
        This species of hypocrisy ought to be avoided. When an author speaks of
        his poor abilities, and tells us he is the most unfit man for the work
        he has undertaken, he is generally insincere; but if not insincere, he
        must be unwise; for God never requires us to exercise a talent which He
        has not bestowed on us. Think soberly. — Christians are here directed to
        make a sound and moderate estimate of their own gifts, which will
        preserve them from both extremes, — on the one hand, from overrating,
        and, on the other, from unduly depreciating, their attainments or
        talents. According as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
        — God hath given us here, by the Apostle, a standard by which we may
        measure ourselves. Of the term ‘faith’ in this place, various
        explanations are given; but that it simply means faith in its usual
        acceptation throughout the Scriptures, as this is the most obvious, so
        it appears to be its true import.
      </p>
      <p>
        By faith we are united to the Savior, and by faith is received out of
        His fullness all that is imparted to us by God. The measure, then, of
        faith, with which each believer is blessed, whether strong faith or
        weak, great faith or little, indicates with certainty both his real
        character before God, and his relative standing among other believers.
        According, therefore, to his faith, as evidenced by his works, every
        Christian ought to estimate himself: The man who has the greatest faith
        is the highest in the school of Christ. We here also learn that not only
        faith, but every degree of it, is the gift of God; for men believe
        according as God hath dealt to each of them the measure of faith; and
        ‘unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the
        gift of Christ.’ By the consideration of the manner in which the Apostle
        thus enforces his admonition, the believer will both be moderated in his
        own esteem, and also in his desire for the esteem of others. He will
        consequently be much less exposed to encounter what may inflame his
        pride, or tend to his discouragement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
        not the same office; The Apostle here illustrates the union and
        connection of believers, by the figure of the wonderful structure of the
        human body. Every member has its proper place in the body, and its
        proper function to perform, and every member is valuable according as it
        is useful in the body. But no member is useless. For the smallest and
        least honorable is useful. But this does not imply, as Mr. Stuart
        understands it, that there is no superiority of value among the members.
        This is contrary to obvious fact, and contrary to the nature of the
        figure here employed. One member of the human body is more useful, and,
        as Paul says to the Corinthians, more honorable than another; but the
        least honorable is useful, and to be treated with respect. ‘To show,’
        says Mr. Stuart, ‘that no one has any reason to set up himself as
        superior to others, the Apostle now introduces the admirable comparison
        of the body of Christ, i.e., the Church, with the human body.’

      <p>
        Surely it is not to teach us that all the members of the body of Christ
        are equally valuable, that the Apostle introduces the comparison. Such a
        comparison would be very ill chosen; for among the members of the body
        there is a great variety in their relative scale of importance. Who
        would not rather lose a joint of his finger than his eye? But while one
        member is more important than another in the human body, as well as in
        the body of Christ, every member is important; every member has its
        peculiar function, which contributes to the good of the whole, and which
        the most honorable members are not adapted to perform. The eye is a more
        important member than the foot, but the eye could not perform for the
        good of the body that function which the foot performs. The eye,
        therefore, as well as every other member of the body, ought to honor the
        foot, according to the value of the services it is adapted to perform.
        Office. — This does not mean office in a restricted sense, because every
        member of the body has such an office. It means office in its general
        sense of function.
      </p>

        Ver. 5. — So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
        remembers one of another.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we, being many, are one body. — This is not to be restricted to one
        church, as to the church at Rome, to which it was written, but refers to
        the Church of Christ, which embraces His people of all ages, and of all
        countries. The feeblest disciple, even he who of the whole number is
        least instructed in his Master’s will, has still his place in the body,
        and his use in that place. Whatever church, then, refuses to receive any
        Christian for want of knowledge of any part of the will of Christ, acts
        against the spirit of this passage. It is wrong either to refuse
        admission to Christ’s known people, or to admit His known enemies. In
        Christ. — Not, as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight understands it, ‘under Christ.’ It is not by our being under
        Christ that our union is effected with one another, but by being in
        Christ. Members one of another. — By being united in Christ, believers
        become members of one another, that is, they are united to each other,
        as all the members of the body are united. The most remote members are
        united by their union with the body. The hands and the feet have
        fellowship through the intervening members. Hence Christians ought to
        love one another as parts of themselves. As the Apostle says, no man
        ever hated his own body; and he that loveth his wife loveth himself. For
        a like reason, a Christian, when loving his fellow-Christians, is loving
        himself. It is thus that Christians, in the Church of Christ, taken
        individually, are many, and are together one body in Christ, having the
        Spirit of Christ, and all of them are members one of another. This
        consideration ought to operate powerfully to unite them. There is a
        sectarian partiality, ‘distinct from this, too often found among the
        professors of Christianity. But as the union of Christians, here
        represented by that of the members of the human body, respects none but
        real Christians, and as it respects all such, whether they be eternally
        united in Christian fellowship with us or not, we ought to cultivate
        love to them as to the disciples of Christ, of whatever name, and
        cherish this love to them, on the ground of their union with Christ. We
        ought to unite with the Apostle in praying ‘Grace be with all them that
        love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
        given to us whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the
        proportion of faith; Having then gifts differing according to the grace
        that is given to us. — Upon this Dr. Macknight observes: — ’As the grace
        of apostleship signifies the office of an apostle graciously conferred,
        so the grace here said to be given to the Romans may mean the particular
        station and office in the Church assigned to individuals by Christ.’ But
        the word grace has neither the one signification nor the other. It is
        that favor by which Christ confers His gifts on the members of His body.
        Office in the Church belongs to few of them, but they all possess gifts
        or talents by which they may be useful to the body. Many of the gifts
        possessed when the Apostle wrote, were gifts miraculously bestowed; but
        even at that time they were not all such.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the word gifts includes those gifts that are given in providence, or
        conferred by constitution, talent, birth, education, and other
        circumstances, as well as the extraordinary gifts immediately conferred
        by the Holy Spirit. Riches and natural eloquence are gifts, as well as
        the miraculous ability to speak in languages not previously learned.
        Christians, then, should consider everything they possess as a gift
        bestowed by God, which they should cultivate and use to His glory, and
        for which they are accountable. If a Christian misspends his money, his
        time, his abilities, his influence, or any talent which God has
        conferred on him, he is not misspending his own, but, is misspending
        what is entrusted to him by God. He is unfaithful in his trust. Whether
        prophecy. — Prophecy strictly signifies the foretelling of future
        events. But it seems also to be extended to denote any message from God,
        whether relating to things present or to come, and, in the New
        Testament, to refer to the exposition of Scripture. Calvin, after
        remarking that ‘some mean by prophecy the power of prediction which
        flourished in the Church at its commencement,’ afterwards observes, ‘I
        prefer the opinion of those commentators who take the word in a more
        extended sense, and apply it to the peculiar gift of explaining
        revelation, according as any one executes with skill and dexterity the
        office of an interpreter in declaring the will of God. Prophecy,
        therefore, at this period, is nothing else in the Christian Church than
        the proper understanding of Scripture, and a peculiar faculty of
        explaining the same; since all the ancient prophecies, and all the
        oracles of God, were contained in Christ and His Gospel. For Paul
        understood it in this sense, 1 Corinthians 14:5, when he said, ‘I would
        that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that you prophesied’ ‘We know
        in part, and we prophesy in part,’ 1 Corinthians 13:9. For it does not
        appear that Paul was only desirous in this passage to recount those
        admirable graces by which Christ ennobled His Gospel at the beginning,
        but rather gives a statement of ordinary gifts, which certainly remain
        in the church. Proportion of faith. — They were to speak according to
        the extent of their information or measure of faith. This passage does
        not appear to relate to that principle of interpretation which is called
        the analogy of faith. This is a canon of Scripture interpretation which
        has no doubt been abused; but when rightly applied, as the word of God
        must be consistent with itself, it seems both reasonable and useful.
        Since the time of Dr. Campbell of Aberdeen, who keenly opposed this
        principle, it has been generally renounced by expositors of Scripture;
        yet, when viewed in a proper light, it is by no means liable to the
        exceptions made to it. The objections which Dr. Campbell brings against
        it are fully obviated in Dr. Carson’s late work, entitled, Examination
        of the Principles of Biblical Interpretation of Ernesti; Ammon, Stuart,
        and other Philologists, pp. 103-108. f58 Ver. 7. — Or ministry, let us
        wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or ministry . — The word in the original is that which appropriately
        designates the office of the deacon. If it refers to office, it must
        refer to this officer. For though ministry equally applies to Apostles,
        and all who serve in the Gospel, yet appropriately it refers to one
        office; and when it is applied to others, it is with circumstances that
        make the reference obvious. Indeed, what is here said applies to all
        offices as well as to that of the deacon; but this should not influence
        us so as to prevent our ascertaining its immediate reference. There is
        no necessity here to restrict the word to an official meaning, for it
        will apply to every one who devotes himself to the interests of the body
        of Christ. As Howard, the philanthropist, was to humanity, so may many
        Christians be to the Church of Christ, — at least, to that part of it
        with which they are more immediately connected. He that teacheth on
        teaching. — Fitness to teach is a gift of the Head of the Church, which
        all who teach ought to possess, and without which no appointment of any
        one can make Him a minister of Christ. They who possess the gift of
        teaching ought to employ it diligently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
        do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth
        mercy, with cheerfulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        He that exhorteth. — This means to excite to duty and dissuade from sin,
        and requires a peculiar talent. Mr. Stuart supposes that the teacher and
        exhorter were different officers; but it is quite obvious that the
        Apostle is not distinguishing offices, but gifts. Every gift does not
        require a different office. Many of the gifts required no office at all.
        No opinion can be more groundless, than that the gifts imply each a
        separate office in the Church. He that giveth. — This is usually
        supposed to refer to the deacon; but as the Apostle is not speaking of
        the distinction or number of offices, and as the word used is not so
        restricted, there is no just ground thus to limit the passage. It
        includes the deacon, but is not confined to him. Mr. Stuart, however, is
        not justified in saying that the word ‘properly means to impart among
        others what belongs to one’s self; to give to others.’ It is not
        essential to the word whether the gift proceeds from the giver as the
        owner, or merely as the steward. The gifts conferred by the Apostles
        were not their own; yet Paul applies the word ( Romans 1:11) to the
        communication of a spiritual gift through his hands to the Church. But
        to prove that the word here extends to those who gave of their own
        substance, it is not required that the word cannot apply to official or
        vicarious alms. It is enough that the word is one of a general meaning,
        and applies to the giving of one’s own. Why should it be confined to
        official giving, when there is nothing restrictive in the word or in the
        circumstances? Why should it be confined to the deacon, when the Apostle
        is not at all treating of office, but of gifts possessed by unofficial
        as well as official persons. With simplicity. — This means singleness of
        view It guards against ostentation or love of praise, on account of
        which the Pharisees gave their alms. The word is sometimes used to
        signify liberality, and is so understood here by Mr. Stuart. This
        meaning is not unsuitable, but still the other is more appropriate In
        all cases Christians need the caution to give with simplicity, but it
        would not be possible for some to give with what is generally understood
        by liberality. He that ruleth. — Mr. Stuart labors hard, but
        unsuccessfully, to make it appear that this word does not here apply to
        presiding or ruling in the Church, but to assisting the poor by
        hospitality, like Phebe. The word is usually applied to presiding in the
        church; and when it is used without a regimen, the most obvious meaning
        must be supplied to fill up the ellipsis.
      </p>
      <p>
        That this will confine it to ruling in the church admits of no question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presiding or ruling in the church is here considered, not with a view to
        its distinction from other offices, but with respect to the gift that
        fits for it. ‘Some are of opinion,’ says Dr. Macknight, ‘that the
        president was one appointed to superintend those who were employed in
        distributing the church’s alms.’ There can be no doubt that the word
        would apply to a president of any kind. But to believe that it signifies
        here such presidents, when it is appropriated to other presidents in the
        church, and when there is no evidence that there were any presidents of
        the kind supposed, is building without a foundation. With diligence. —
        The ruler is to attend to his office with earnestness and diligence It
        is the duty of all to spend and to be spent in the service of their
        Lord. Showeth mercy. — This signifies the giving of money, or anything,
        for the support of poor brethren; or applies to every instance in which
        mercy was to be shown to the afflicted, whether the affliction arose
        from poverty, sickness, or any other calamity. With cheerfulness. —
        Mercy must be shown, not only so as to indicate that it is voluntary,
        but also with cheerfulness, which shows that is a pleasure. This spares
        the feelings and soothes the sorrows of the afflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil,
        cleave to that which is good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let love be without dissimulation. — There seems to be here an indirect
        allusion to those hollow pretensions of love so generally manifested in
        society. Men pretend to have the greatest love to each other, when they
        not only have no love at all, but when they may really be under the
        influence of a contrary disposition. Calvin well observes on this
        passage. ‘It is difficult to give a view of the ingenuity with which a
        large portion of mankind assume the appearance of that love which they
        really do not possess. For they not only deceive others, but impose upon
        themselves, while they endeavor to believe that they entertain a very
        considerable share of love, even for those whom they not only treat with
        neglect, but in reality renounce and despise. Paul therefore declares
        that only to be genuine love which is free from all dissimulation and
        guile; and every person can best Judge for himself whether he entertains
        any feeling in the innermost recesses of his heart opposed to this noble
        and lasting affection.’ Christians ought to be careful that, while they
        use to each other the endearing language of brethren, they feel the
        sentiments and perform the actions which this language imports. ‘Above
        all things,’ says the Apostle Peter, ‘have fervent charity (love) among
        yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.’ Believers
        ought to throw the mantle of love over the numerous faults into which
        their brethren may fall, in their conduct towards them, and thus to hide
        them from their eyes, forgiving their faults, even as God, for Christ’s
        sake, hath forgiven them, Ephesians 4:32. Abhor that which is evil;
        cleave to that which is good. — With respect to this, Calvin observes,
        ‘The words following in the context, good and evil, have not a general
        meaning; but by evil is intended that malicious iniquity which injures
        any person; and by good, that kindness by which are afforded to others
        aid and assistance.’ But it rather appears that the words in this place
        are to be viewed as to what is bad and good in general. We ought not
        only to avoid doing what is evil, but to accustom ourselves to abhor it,
        as the vilest and most offensive of things are abhorred To what which is
        good we ought to cling with all our hearts. Christians are not to be
        satisfied with abstaining from what is evil, and practicing what is
        good.
      </p>
      <p>
        The affections of their minds should be in unison with their duty; they
        should hate as well as avoid what is sinful, and love as well as
        practice what is good. We thus learn that we are accountable to God for
        the state of our minds, as well as for our external conduct. We should
        not only not practice, but not love evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
        honor preferring one another; Be kindly affectioned one to another with
        brotherly love. — This appears to indicate; that in brotherly love
        believers ought to have that affection for one another which nature
        displays among those who are brothers in the flesh. Brotherhood in
        Christians ought not to be a mere name, but a reality, evinced by the
        affections of a relationship of kindred. All Christians are brethren;
        they are born of one Father, who hath taught them to say, ‘Our Father,
        who art in heaven.’ He who loves the Father, loves the Brethren.
        ‘Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God; and every
        one that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of
        Him.’ In honor preferring one another. — Among those who derive the same
        meaning from these words, there is a great variety in their method of
        expressing it. Calvin, with many others, understood it as our
        translators, that each in honor prefer his brother to himself, agreeably
        to other texts of Scripture. But the word signifies, in general, to lead
        before, and has a great variety of applications. The meaning here seems
        to be, that in showing mutual respect they ought each to strive to take
        the lead. This is a thing in which they may lawfully strive with one
        another. While the men of the world are striving to outstrip each other
        in everything that respects ambition, Christians are to refrain from
        following their example; but they are permitted and enjoined to strive
        with one another in the indication of mutual respect. Dr. Macknight
        understands the passage to mean, ‘In every honorable action go before,
        and lead on one another.’ But it seems forced to understand ‘honor’ as
        signifying every honorable action. The word appears to have a limited
        reference to the honor to be shown to one another by the brethren. — ’In
        lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than himself,’
        Philippians 2:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the
        Lord; Not slothful in business. — It does not appear that the word in
        the original can bear to be translated business. It denotes eagerness,
        earnestness, zeal, urgency, etc. The meaning appears to be, that in
        doing everything with respect to things both temporal and spiritual
        believers are not to be slothful or indulge in indolence; but in every
        duty to use exertion and manifest earnestness. Fervent in Spirit. — A
        fervent spirit is the reverse of sloth, and always prompts to diligence
        and vigor of action. Christians ought to possess such a spirit in doing
        all their business, especially in the things of the Lord. Earnestness in
        doing good, says Calvin, requires a zeal and ardor, lighted up in our
        breasts by the Spirit of God, Acts 18:25. Serving the Lord — Christians
        are here exhorted to consider themselves as the servants or slaves of
        the Lord Jesus Christ. They are so in the fullest sense of the word as
        concerns Christ’s right to them, and authority over them, and the duty
        of their being solely devoted to Him. They have none of the disagreeable
        feelings of slavery, because Christ’s service is their delight, their
        honor, and their interest. Though the precept applies generally, yet it
        appears to have a particular reference, from the connection to the duty
        of fervency of spirit which precedes it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians should consider themselves as wholly and at all times the
        servants of the Lord, and, remembering that His eye is ever upon them,
        do all things as in His presence. It is not merely in acts of worship,
        or on particular occasions, that they are to be considered as serving
        Him, but in all their lives and all their actions. They are in their
        worldly employments and engagements to do all with a view to the
        authority of their Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in eating and drinking, they are exhorted by the Apostle to act for
        the glory of God. If Christians would keep this at all times before
        their minds, how much would their happiness be increased! For we may be
        assured that an increase in our obedience to our heavenly Master will
        always be accompanied with an increase of true happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant
        in prayer; Again and again it is enjoined on believers to rejoice in the
        Lord — in the contemplation of His person, His offices, His power, His
        love, and in their union with Him. Here, in the midst of exhortations to
        attend to various duties, they are commanded to rejoice in hope. Hope is
        founded on faith, and faith on the Divine testimony. Hope, then,
        respects what God has declared in His word. We are here exhorted to
        exercise hope with respect to future glory, and to rejoice in the
        contemplation of the objects of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        What can be better calculated to promote joy than the hope of obtaining
        blessings so glorious in a future world? Were this hope kept in lively
        exercise, it would raise believers above the fear of man and a concern
        for the honors of this world. It would also enable them to despise the
        shame of the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objects, then, of the believer’s hope are the spiritual and
        celestial: blessings which are yet future, to which his eyes should
        constantly be directed, and which are calculated to fill him with the
        greatest joy. It is not the prospect of terrestrial possessions in which
        he is to rejoice, but of a house eternal in the heavens. ‘In Thy
        presence is fullness of joy; at Thy right hand there are pleasures for
        evermore.’ It is that glorious communion with Jesus Christ of which the
        Apostle speaks, when he says, ‘Having a desire to depart, and to be with
        Christ; which is far better.’ It is that state in which believers shall
        be like Him, for they shall see Him as He is. ‘As for me, I will behold
        Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with Thy
        likeness.’ It is the hope of righteousness for which through the Spirit,
        believers wait, Galatians 5:5. This hope is founded on the unchangeable
        promise of God — on His promise accompanied by His oath — on the blood
        of Christ with which He has sealed His promise — on Him who was not only
        dead, but is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
        maketh intercession for His people. This hope, then, is both sure and
        steadfast, and entereth into that within the vail, whither the
        forerunner, even Jesus, is for us entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        This description of hope, as an anchor both sure and steadfast, confutes
        the erroneous doctrine of Roman Catholics, who maintain, as has been
        formerly observed, that the hope of the Gospel is a doubtful conjecture,
        instead of a firm expectation of future blessedness. They insist that
        the believer ought to be always in doubt as to his salvation; that he
        cannot know whether God loves or hates him; and that all the assurance
        he can have of His salvation can never go beyond conjecture. Is this,
        then, the anchor both sure and steadfast which enables the believer to
        remain firm amidst the storms and agitations of this unsettled world?
        Can he rejoice in a hope so uncertain and unstable? That Roman Catholics
        should thus reduce to doubt and uncertainty that hope which the believer
        is commanded to maintain perfectly ( 1 Peter 1:13), is not to be
        wondered at, since it is partly on their own merits, and on the
        satisfaction and sufferings of their saints, that their hope is founded,
        and not exclusively on the blood of Christ. The believer is here
        commanded to rejoice in hope; and if he consider that he is bound to
        apply to himself the other injunctions contained in this portion of the
        word of God, and to act upon them, he ought equally to regard it as his
        duty to obey this injunction, and to remember that, if he is not obeying
        it, it is an indication that all is not right with him. The same
        conclusion may also be drawn, if he is not walking according to that
        other express command in chapter sixth, to reckon himself to be deed
        indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hope of the glory of God, in which the Apostle here affirms that
        Christians ought to rejoice, is provided as an important part of the
        believer’s armor, — an helmet to cover his head, to defend him against
        the attacks of his spiritual enemies, 1 Thessalonians 5:8. It supports
        him when ready to be cast down. ‘Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and
        why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet
        praise Him who is the health of my countenance and my God.’ It soothes
        the bitterness of affliction when the believer is resting on the
        promises of God. In prosperity it elevates his affections, and, fixing
        his expectation on the glory that shall be revealed, disengages him from
        the love of this world. ‘My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God;
        when shall I come and appear before God?’ It comforts him in the
        prospect of death; and he says, with his Savior, ‘My heart is glad, and
        my glory rejoiceth, my flesh also shall rest in hope.’ His spirit at
        death ascends to mingle with the spirits of just men made perfect, while
        his body enters the grave as a place of rest, waiting for its glorious
        resurrection, and the day when he shall sing that song of triumph. ‘O
        death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory?’ It is the
        prayer of the Apostle, ch. 15:13, that the God of hope would fill His
        people with all joy and peace in believing, that they may abound in
        hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. Patient in tribulation. —
        Since Christians have such a good hope through grace, they ought to be
        patient under their afflictions. Nothing is better calculated to enable
        us to bear calamities than the hope of a happy result.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what can equal the prospects of the Christian when he has passed
        through the furnace and been tried as gold? His afflictions are not only
        necessary for his trial, and honorable to God, but they are for his own
        eternal advantage. The light afflictions of the righteous, which are but
        for a moment, work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight
        of glory. The trial of their faith is much more precious than that of
        gold, though it be tried with fire, and shall be found unto praise and
        honor and glory in the day of Christ. Afflictions are sent by God to His
        people to increase their patience. On account of remaining sin, they are
        their portion while in the body. ‘In the world ye shall have
        tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.’
        Continuing instant in prayer. — The Christian is to ‘pray without
        ceasing.’ No duty can be well performed without this. It is especially
        necessary in the time of affliction. ‘Paul also,’ says Calvin, ‘not only
        excites us to prayer, but expressly requires performance; because our
        warfare is unceasing, and we are daily attacked by various assaults,
        which champions even of the greatest bravery are unable to support
        without an occasional supply of new vigor. Unceasing continuance in
        prayer is the best remedy against fatigue.’ It is impossible that
        believers can discharge the various duties which are here enforced,
        without having their eyes constantly directed to their heavenly Father,
        and without receiving from Him the will and the capacity necessary for
        their discharge Our Lord’s parable of the unjust judge, Luke 18:1,
        contains the strongest encouragement to perseverance and importunity in
        prayer. The Lord commands His disciples to pray always, on account of
        the power of their spiritual enemies, who are constantly seeking their
        destruction. The Apostle also exhorts believers to pray always with all
        prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and to watch thereunto with all
        perseverance; to continue in prayer, and watch in the same with
        thanksgiving; in everything giving thanks, for this is the will of God
        in Christ Jesus; and to be careful for nothing, but in everything, by
        prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, to let their requests be
        made known unto God. If a Christian undertakes anything whatever without
        prayer, he is neglecting his duty and not acting up to his privileges.
        In that matter he is not walking with God, whose ears are open to the
        prayers of the righteous. On occasions, even, when there is not a moment
        to deliberate, and when an immediate decision is indispensable, there is
        still time for prayer and for receiving an answer, Nehemiah 2:4,8.
      </p>
      <p>
        The believer, too, should ever address his heavenly Father with full
        confidence that his prayers will be heard, not perhaps according to his
        wishes, but in a way that in the issue will be more advantageous. ‘This
        is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according
        to His will, He heareth us. And if we know that He hear us whatsoever we
        ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him
        ‘Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may
        be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do
        it.’ ‘Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.’ ‘And all
        things whatsoever ye shall ask in Prayer, believing, ye shall receive.’
        If the believer asks and does not receive, it is because he asks amiss
        he does not ask in faith, he asks for things that are not proper, he
        asks while he is indulging in sin. ‘The sacrifice of the wicked is an
        abomination to the Lord; but the prayer of the upright is His delight.’
        If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,’ Psalm
        66:18. Here, however, it is proper to remark that there is a great
        difference between iniquity prevailing in the heart, and iniquity
        regarded in the heart. In the last case we cannot draw near with
        acceptance. God will not accept our prayers, because in that case we
        cannot draw near with ‘a true heart.’ But in the former case, of
        iniquity prevailing in the hearts we may draw near in the full assurance
        of faith, of which we see an example in the case of David. ‘Iniquities,’
        he says, ‘prevail against me;’ but he immediately adds, ‘As for our
        transgressions, Thou shalt purge them away,’ Psalm 65:3.

        Ver. 13. — Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to
        hospitality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Distributing to the necessity of saints. — Rather ‘communicating to the
        necessities of the saints.’ The poor brethren are thus made joint
        partakers of the substance of their richer brethren; the rich make their
        poor brethren participators with them in their substance, by giving them
        what is necessary to supply their wants. ‘Observe,’ says Calvin, ‘the
        propriety of the expression. The apostle thus intimates that we ought to
        supply the wants of our brethren with as much care as if we were
        assisting ourselves.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It may here be observed that this precept proves most clearly that there
        was no general custom among the first Christians of a community of
        goods. Had this been the case, the rich would not have been commanded to
        communicate to the necessities of the saints. It ought also to be noted
        that it is to the necessities of the saints that communication is to be
        made, not to their indolence. ‘This we commanded you, that if any would
        not work neither should he eat.’ So far from its being the duty of
        Christians to support the idle, it would be a breach of one of the laws
        of Christ’s kingdom. Saints. — It may also be observed that, while we
        are to do good unto all men, the poor saints are the peculiar care of a
        church of Christ. These are to be fed as children of the family who are
        unable to support themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here also, we may see the character of the members of the first
        churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were such only as appeared to be saints and godly in Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term saints signify those who are separated for the service of God —
        sanctified in Christ Jesus. This appellation belongs to all the people
        of God without distinction, and not to a particular class or part of
        them exclusively, such as to the Apostles. The Apostles were indeed
        saints, and so were Noah, Abraham, Moses, and all the Prophets. If this
        title were indiscriminately applied to all who are sanctified in Christ
        Jesus, — that is, to every Christian, — as in the apostolical Epistles,
        it could not be misunderstood; but its exclusive application to Apostles
        and some others besides, leads to the supposition that all Christians
        are not saints. This application is one of the engines of the Man of
        Sin, by which he deceives.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any plead for it as a proper distinction, it is sufficient to advert
        to the saying of Paul, ‘We have no such custom, neither the churches of
        God,’ 1 Corinthians 11:16. Here the reference is to the approved customs
        of the churches acting under the immediate guidance of the Apostles,
        which consequently are equivalent to direct precept. We find no such
        custom in the Scriptures, in which Prophets and Apostles name
        themselves, and each other, without this distinction. Given to
        hospitality. — This does not mean, as it is generally now applied,
        social intercourse and conviviality among neighbors, but it means the
        receiving and entertaining of strangers at a distance from their own
        habitations. This was a duty of peculiar necessity in the primitive
        times, when inns and places of entertainment were unusual. But it is a
        duty still; and the change of times and customs cannot set aside any of
        the precepts of our Lord Jesus Christ. Christians ought hospitably to
        receive their brethren coming from a distance, and to assist them in
        their business. We are here directed not only to practice hospitality,
        but, according to the import of the original, to follow or pursue it.
        Christians are to seek opportunities of this manifesting love to their
        brethren. In another place the Apostle enforces the same duty: ‘Be not
        forgetful to entertain strangers; for thereby some have entertained
        angels unawares.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 14. — Bless them which persecute you; bless, and curse not.</p>
      <p>
        Bless them which persecute you. — Calvin justly cautions us against
        endeavoring to find a certain order in these precepts. It is their
        import, and not their connection with each other, that we ought to
        ascertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes there may be a relation; at other times there is entire
        independence. The precept here given cannot be obeyed in its genuine
        sense by any who are not born again of the incorruptible seed of the
        word; and even to such it is a difficult duty. In proportion to their
        progress in the Divine life, will there be in them a difference with
        respect to their attainments in that heavenly spirit which enables them
        to comply with this injunction. But none can justly be looked on as
        Christians, who do not in some measure possess this spirit, and practice
        this precept. If this be so, how few are the genuine disciples of
        Christ! ‘None,’ says Calvin, ‘can boast himself to be a son of God, or
        glory in the name of a Christian, who has not in part put on this mind,
        which was in the Lord Jesus, and does not daily wrestle against and
        oppose the feeling of enmity and hatred. The law of God is in all
        respects a law of love, and the precept here enjoined contains a
        peculiar characteristic of Christianity, in the exhibition of which
        Christians are imitators of their heavenly Father. Our Lord Jesus Christ
        gave a signal example of obedience to this rule, when on the cross He
        prayed to his Father for the pardon of those by whom He was crucified.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Stephen, the first martyr, in imitation of his Divine Master, died
        in calling on His name, and praying for his murderers. This precept
        teaches Christians in what manner, when reviled or persecuted, they
        ought to act to their persecutors.’ ‘Being defamed,’ says the Apostle,
        ‘we entreat.’ The repetition of the precept in the following clause adds
        to the energy of the expression. Bless and curse not. — Paul repeats the
        precept to bless, on account of its importance, and its applicability to
        men in general, in connection with a command to curse no man. How does
        this condemn the Church of Rome, which so frequently manifests its
        antichristian character by cursing its enemies, and allowing its priests
        to curse from the altar those who give them offense. How many are there,
        who, calling themselves Christians openly and without shame utter
        maledictions on those who irritate them!
      </p>
      <p>
        How few abstain from imprecations of every kind and degree! f59 Ver. 15.
        — Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep.
      </p>
      <p>
        This precept has no doubt a peculiar importance with respect to the
        brethren, but it is applicable in general. We ought to sympathize with
        our fellow-creatures in their happiness and afflictions. The meaning of
        the precept is quite obvious. The prosperity of others ought to inspire
        us with joy. Their affliction ought to affect us with sorrow. Even the
        very semblance of this duty among the people of the world has a
        beneficial influence on society, heightening the joy of prosperity, and
        lessening the pain of adversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things
        but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be of the same mind one toward another. — This precept refers rather to
        unanimity, cordiality, and harmony in transacting all the business of
        the Church, than to oneness of mind as to the truth. With respect to
        faith, it is the word of God with which believers are to be in
        accordance, and not with the opinions of each other. Besides, this
        often-repeated precept is always introduced with others of a practical
        nature. Oneness of belief in everything, even the least part of the
        revelation of God, is of importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This, however, cannot be effected but by a full knowledge of the Divine
        word. The injunction is most important, and cautions against a captious
        spirit respecting the affairs of the church with which we are connected,
        or our intercourse one with another. Dr. Macknight has entirely mistaken
        the import of this passage, making it refer to what precedes. ‘Be of the
        same hospitable, forgiving, sympathizing disposition towards one another
        as towards strangers and persecutors.’ Mind not high things. — Men in
        general are aspiring to things above them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great efforts of life are to obtain high rank or commanding station
        in the world. Christians are here cautioned against setting their minds
        on high things. Nothing can be more opposed to progress in the Divine
        life, than the evil against which we are here warned. In proportion as
        Christians indulge it, they make their bed among thorns, turning away
        their eyes from the glory of their future inheritance. Condescend to men
        of low estate. — The word here translated condescend signifies to be led
        away with; and that which is rendered men of low estate may with equal
        propriety be rendered low or humble things; and in this way the clause
        is an antithesis to the one preceding. ‘Not thinking of high things,’
        says Calvin, ‘by which he means that a Christian ought not to aspire, in
        an ambitious manner, after those things by which he may surpass others,
        nor indulge in haughty feelings, but meditate rather upon modesty and
        meekness; for our excellence, in the presence of God, consists in these
        virtues, not in pride or the contempt of our brethren. This precept is
        properly added to the former; for nothing breaks the unity mentioned by
        the Apostle more completely than the exalting of ourselves, and our
        aspiring to something still more elevated, with a view to attain a
        higher situation. I take the word humble in the neuter gender, that the
        antithesis may be more complete.’ Be not wise in your own conceits. — ’
        This sentence,’ says Calvin, ‘connects with the preceding part of the
        context; for nothing inflates the mind more than a high opinion of our
        own wisdom and prudence.’ Self-conceit is an evidence of weakness of
        mind and of ignorance. So far as it manifests itself among Christians,
        it evidences low attainments in the knowledge of the things of God, and
        is most destructive to the harmony of a church, and the improvement of
        the individual under its influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in
        the sight of all men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recompense to no man evil for evil. — It is natural to every man to
        return evil for evil. Those of the most indolent and passive
        dispositions are not without feelings of revenge. Nothing but the faith
        of Christ will enable any man to overcome this disposition. But faith
        will overcome it; and every man who believes in Christ most labor to
        overcome it in his heart, as well as in his practice. If Christians are
        tried by this test, the pretensions of the great bulk of those who usurp
        the name will be found groundless. Provide things honest in the sight
        off all men. — We are not to do our work to be seen of men, but we are
        to be careful that all our works are done so as to avoid anything that
        would bring a reproach upon the Gospel. We ought not only to abstain
        from what we know to be wrong, but we ought sedulously to avoid just
        suspicion, 1 Thessalonians 5:22. Sometimes Christians say that if they
        have a good conscience, they care not what any one thinks of them. But
        this is contrary to this precept. If we are falsely charged, we may
        commit ourselves to Him who judgeth righteously. But, so far as in our
        power, we are not only to avoid what is improper, but to avoid the blame
        or suspicion of what is improper. In Paul himself we see an example of
        solicitude in this respect. ‘Providing for honest things, not only in
        the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men,’ 2 Corinthians
        8:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
        with all men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such is the state of human nature, that offenses must needs come, and
        here the Apostle, in his exhortation, proceeds on the fact of the
        difficulty of living at peace with all. The believer is,
        notwithstanding, constantly to aim at this, and to pursue it even when
        it seems to fly from him. He ought particularly to guard against giving
        occasion to any just subject of complaint against him. To live at peace
        with all men, as far as is attainable, without sacrificing duty, is not
        only duty, but for his happiness. To pursue peace, then, is to fly from
        misery. It is impossible to be happy in disturbance, and broils, and
        enmities; but it may sometimes be impossible for Christians to obtain
        peace. When this is the case, they must submit to it as one of the
        greatest afflictions; but we ought to recollect that it is God who
        giveth us peace with men, and to seek it from Him with ardent prayer, as
        well as from men, by unremitting endeavors after it. When deprived of
        it, we ought also to inquire whether there be not a cause of this in
        ourselves; for when a man’s ways please the Lord, He maketh even his
        enemies to be at peace with him. Calvin justly cautions us ‘not so to
        affect the security of the favor and esteem of men, as to refuse to
        incur, for the sake of Christ, the hatred of any human being, when
        necessary.’ As some Christians may be naturally of a contentious
        disposition, so others may, from a selfish desire of having the favor
        and good opinion and praise of men, be inclined to keep out of view
        whatever is most offensive in the religion of Christ. Such persons may
        congratulate themselves on the possession of a spirit of peace, but it
        is only a spirit of cowardice and selfishness, a spirit of worldly
        indifference to the glory of God and the salvation of men. We are never
        to seek to maintain peace, either with the world or with Christians, by
        the sacrifice of any part of Divine truth. A Christian must be willing
        to be unpopular, that he may be useful and faithful. To whatever obloquy
        or opposition it may expose him, he ought earnestly to contend for the
        faith which was once delivered unto the saints.

        Ver. 19. — Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
        unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith
        the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves. — As by the law in the members we
        are most strongly urged to take revenge on those who injure us, the
        Apostle introduces this dissuasive against indulging this corrupt
        principle, with the most endearing address. Christians will constantly
        have opportunities of exercising themselves in obedience to this
        exhortation.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are innumerable occurrences calculated to provoke and excite them
        to retaliation. But they will find that to abstain from avenging their
        own cause will essentially promote their happiness. It is a painful
        thing to think of injuries, and it is most for our peace and happiness
        to forget them, and commit ourselves to the Lord. How opposite is this
        from the principles of the men of the world, and what are called the
        laws of honor, in obedience to which a man will, in cold blood, he; said
        his own life and that of his neighbor on account of some contemptuous
        expression or trivial injury! What gross ignorance does it manifest to
        consider any man a Christian, who is always prepared to act in this
        manner, and who would regard it as an affront if the contrary were
        supposed! Give place unto wrath. — Calvin, Dr. Macknight, and Mr. Stuart
        understand this of the wrath of God; but notwithstanding what the latter
        has alleged in confirmation of this, the common view of the passage is
        unquestionably the just one. No principle of language will justify the
        ellipsis that makes wrath in this connection designate the wrath of God
        or the Divine wrath. Among the various applications of the phrase ‘Give
        place,’ one of them is, to retire from the place, that it may be
        occupied by another, Luke 14:9. The person here referred to gives the
        place that he occupied to another, and retires to another place. This
        meaning, then, is quite in accordance with that of the common
        explanation of this passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give place to wrath, that is, leave the place, and let wrath occupy it;
        or give place, as a man would do if attacked by a wild beast, stepping
        aside to let it rush by. Mr. Stuart, indeed, alleges that the other
        interpretation ‘is rendered nearly certain by the quotation which
        immediately follows,’ which he supposes would be wholly inapposite if
        wrath be understood as referring to the wrath of the enemy. This
        argument, however, is without force. The meaning objected to is quite
        consistent with the quotation. ‘Take not revenge yourselves, my
        brethren, but retire from the contest, for it is not you but God who has
        a right to take vengeance.’ It is a good reason why we should not take
        vengeance, that it is God’s prerogative to take vengeance. For it is
        written, Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. — It belongs
        to God, and He will repay it. Those threatenings of the vengeance of God
        which we find in the writings of the Prophets, and especially in the
        Book of Psalm, are not to be viewed as proceeding from the angry spirit
        of the writers, but from the Holy Ghost who dictated them, who hates,
        and will come out of his place to punish, all workers of iniquity. If
        any man dare to take into his own hands the vengeance which belongeth to
        God, it will recoil upon himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this it is evident that God will avenge the injuries done to His
        people. What, then, shall be the punishment of those who employ
        themselves in persecuting, injuring, reproaching, and slandering the
        disciples of Christ. We are not, however, to understand this precept as
        prohibiting Christians from appealing to the magistrate in case of
        injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calvin, indeed, justly observes, that it prohibits us from applying to
        the magistrate from a principle of revenge. It is quite true that to
        appeal to the magistrate out of a principle of revenge is indulging
        revenge as much as if we took revenge with our own hands. But it is
        often right to appeal to the laws of our country in order to secure the
        peace of society, and defend ourselves and others from similar injuries.
        To act on the principle avowed by some, that it is wrong to apply to the
        power of the civil magistrate, is not only mistaking this precept, but
        is contrary to the fundamental principle on which society rests. In many
        cases it would be highly sinful not to punish evil-doers. If the
        magistrate ought not to bear the sword in vain, the subject ought to
        assist him in executing vengeance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
        give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his
        head.
      </p>
      <p>
        If thine enemy hunger, feed him. — A Christian must be an enemy to no
        man, but he cannot prevent others from being enemies to him; but instead
        of revenging their injuries, he is bound to do good to them. Conduct so
        opposite to nature can never be genuinely effected by the natural man.
        It is only to be effected by the power of God through faith. It is the
        fruit of the new birth only. We are not to understand this precept as
        always to be fulfilled by the giving of meat and drink; but meat and
        drink are taken as an indication that in every possible instance good
        will is to be manifested. Shalt heap coals of fire. — Dr. Macknight,
        with many others, makes this refer to the custom of fusing metals, and
        supposes that it recommends this line of conduct as the most effectual
        way to soften or melt the enemy to repentance. This, however, is a
        meaning made for the words, instead of being extracted from them. Mr.
        Stuart makes it imply pain, but thinks that it is not the pain of
        punishment, but of shame or contrition. This is equally remote from the
        obvious meaning of the expression. Besides, it is equally unwarrantable
        to do anything with a view to occasion the pain of contrition, as to
        occasion the pain of punishment. We should desire the contrition of our
        enemy for his good, and not that he may endure suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vain to force the words of the Holy Spirit. They evidently assert
        that the conduct recommended will have the effect of increasing the
        punishment of the enemies of God’s people; and though they should not
        rejoice in this effect as causing misery, yet they should hereby be led
        to adore the manifestation of Divine justice. Besides, this ought to be
        a warning to their enemies to abandon their wicked conduct, and finally
        to escape the fearful consequences which they cannot avoid if they
        persevere in their enmity. They ought to be informed of this part of the
        Divine pleasure. There can be no doubt that such conduct from the Lord’s
        people, if it does not overcome their enemies, will eventually add to
        their guilt and punishment. We should beware not to explain away the
        words of Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 21. — Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
      <p>
        Be not overcome of evil. — Christians are here exhorted not to suffer
        themselves to indulge a spirit of wrath or resentment from the
        provocations of their enemies. In the world they will experience evil on
        the part of others, but they ought never to allow themselves to be drawn
        into the commission of evil and to be overcome by it. To yield to anger
        is to be conquered by an enemy. Men in general suppose that to resent an
        injury is only to show a proper spirit. But in the estimation of God it
        is the opposite, and manifests defeat. He acts as the Christian, who
        yields not to anger, but remains without wrath under insult and ill
        treatment. When the Lord commanded the disciples to forgive their
        offending brethren, perceiving the difficulty of acting in this manner,
        they immediately prayed, ‘Lord, increase our faith.’ No prayer could be
        more suitable, and nothing more necessary for the performance of this
        duty. Overcome evil with good. — This implies that the injurious person
        may, by repeated acts of kindness, be won over from his enmity. This,
        indeed, frequently happens, and there is hardly a case in which it will
        not have some effect. But whatever may be the success, we ought always
        to make the trial. If our efforts shall be lost on our enemy, they will
        not be lost with respect to ourselves. Our Christian character will be
        more perfected, our happiness will be increased, our ways will be
        pleasing to the Lord, and our reward will be sure. Persons who cannot be
        overcome with good must be in the most awful state of hardened
        wickedness, and their punishment will be dreadful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the above remarkable portion of Scripture, we learn the true tendency
        of the doctrine of salvation wholly by grace, established in a manner so
        powerful in the preceding part of this Epistle, by which men are created
        in Christ Jesus unto good works. How beautiful is it, and how sublime
        when displayed in all its practical effects in the duties which flow
        from it, as here described! We may search all the works of the most
        admired writers, and, so far as they have not borrowed from the fountain
        of inspired truth, we shall find in them nothing comparable to the
        elevated maxims contained in this chapter. Especially we shall not
        discover the faintest shadow of resemblance to the motives by which
        these duties are here inculcated. If the heavens declare the glory of
        God, and the firmament showeth forth His handiworks, — if the invisible
        things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen by the
        things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that the
        heathen are without excuse, — how much more clearly do the Scriptures
        proclaim their Divine origin, and the majesty of their Author! God hath
        magnified His word above all His name, <19D802> Psalm 138:2.
