      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 4:1-25</p>
      <p>
        THIS chapter beautifully connects with all that precedes it. In the
        first chapter the Apostle had announced that ‘the righteousness of God’
        was revealed in the Gospel, which is on that account the power of God
        unto salvation to every one that believeth. He had shown at great length
        that this way of salvation was necessary for man, proving by an appeal
        to fact, and then to Scripture, that both Jews and Gentiles were guilty
        before God, and that, consequently, no one could be justified by his own
        obedience. He had afterwards reverted to this righteousness which God
        had provided in His Son. In this fourth chapter he strikingly
        illustrates these truths, by first obviating the objection that might be
        offered by the Jews respecting their great progenitor Abraham, whose
        character they held in such veneration. This would lead them to suppose
        that he must be an exception to the Apostle’s doctrine, by furnishing an
        example of one justified by works. Having refuted this objection in the
        particular case of Abraham, and confirmed the truth of what he had
        advanced by the testimony of David, Paul makes use of the history of
        Abraham himself to prove what he had previously asserted, and to show
        that in the matter of justification before God there was no exception,
        and no difference between Jews and Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chapter consists of four parts. In the first, the Apostle, by
        referring, as has just been observed, to the history of Abraham and the
        authority of David, illustrates his doctrine of justification by faith.
        Nothing could be so well calculated to convince both Jewish and Gentile
        believers, especially the former, how vain is the expectation of those
        who look for justification by their own works. Abraham was a patriarch
        eminently holy, the head of the nation of Israel, the friend of God, the
        father of all who believe, in whose seed all the nations of the world
        were to be blessed. David was a man according to God’s own heart, the
        progenitor of the Messiah, His great personal type, and a chosen and
        anointed king of Israel. If, then, Abraham had not been justified by his
        works, but by the righteousness of God imputed to him through faith, and
        David, speaking by the Spirit of God, had declared that the only way in
        which a man can receive justification is by his sin being covered by the
        imputation of that righteousness, who could suppose that it was to be
        obtained by any other means? By these two references, the Apostle
        likewise shows that the way of justification was the same from the
        beginning, both under the old and the new dispensation. This he had
        before intimated, in saying that both the law and the Prophets bore
        witness to the righteousness of God, which is now manifested, and which
        is upon all them that believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the other three parts of this chapter, Paul shows, first, that
        circumcision, to which the Jews ascribed so much efficacy, contributed
        nothing to Abraham’s justification, and that the righteousness imputed
        to him was bestowed before his circumcision, with the express intention
        of proving that righteousness should be imputed to all who believe
        though they be not circumcised. In the next place, he proves that the
        promise of the inheritance made to Abraham was not through obedience to
        law, but through that righteousness which is received by faith; and that
        the whole plan of justification was arranged in this manner, in order
        that the blessing conveyed through faith by the free favor of God might
        be made sure to all the seed of Abraham, — that is, to ‘the children of
        the promise,’ Romans 9:8, whether Jews or Gentiles. And, lastly Paul
        describes Abraham’s faith, and states the benefit resulting from its
        exhibition to believers, for whose sake chiefly his faith was recorded.
        It is particularly to be noticed that not a word is said respecting
        Abraham’s sanctification, although his whole history, after leaving his
        own country, furnishes so remarkable an example of a holy walk and
        conversation. All that is brought into view is his faith. It is thus
        shown that neither moral nor ceremonial, neither evangelical nor legal
        works, are of any account whatever in the act of justification, or
        contribute in any degree to procure that blessing. The whole of this
        chapter is particularly calculated to make a deep impression on the
        Jews; and no doubt the day is approaching, and probably near at hand,
        when they will read it with much interest, and derive from it signal
        benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1 — What shall we then say that Abraham, our father as pertaining
        to the flesh, hath found?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the third chapter the Apostle had replied to the objections which
        might be offered to what he had before advanced respecting the Jews.
        First, it might be inquired if, as appeared from his doctrine, the Jew
        could not be saved by their distinguished privileges connected with the
        law, or by observing the rite of circumcision, what advantage did they
        possess over others, and what profit had they from circumcision? Second,
        on the supposition of their being transgressors, it was asked, if their
        sin was the means of condemning the righteousness of God, was it not
        unjust to punish them as sinners? Lastly, if all that had been said was
        true, what were they better than others? After obviating all these
        objections, and proving from the character of the Jews, and of all other
        men as delineated in the Scriptures, the impossibility of their
        justification by the works of law, Paul had exhibited the only way in
        which sinners could be justified before God, and had shown that it was
        effected in such a way that all boasting on the part of man is excluded.
        Another objection might now naturally present itself to the Jews in
        connection with the case of Abraham, who had received the ordinance of
        circumcision from God Himself, and whose eminent piety they held in such
        veneration. It might be asked what, according to the Apostle’s doctrine,
        could be said regarding him: what had he found, or obtained? Did not he
        obtain justification in these ways? Such is the objection which the
        Apostle introduces in this and the following verse, and answers fully in
        both its parts. Abraham our father. — In the course of this chapter
        Abraham is again and again denominated, in a spiritual sense, the father
        of all believers; but in this place, in which the argument from his
        circumcision and holy character refers chiefly to the Jews, to whom much
        of what is said in the preceding chapter relates, it appears that he is
        here spoken of as the natural progenitor of the Jewish nation. The
        expression our is therefore to be considered as referring to the Jews,
        with whom, as being a Jew, the Apostle here classes himself, and not to
        believers generally, whether Jews or Gentiles, as in other verses of
        this chapter. That it is thus to be understood does not appear, however,
        from the expression pertaining to the, flesh, since it is not joined
        with that of father in the original. The order there is, ‘Abraham our
        father hath found as pertaining to the flesh.’ As pertaining to the
        flesh. — That is, by circumcision, of which the Apostle had spoken, ch.
        2; or by any work or privilege, Philippians 3:4.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression, to the flesh, should rather be translated by the flesh,
        as the word here translated as pertaining to, is rendered, ch. 2:7, and
        in many other passages. Circumcision especially was the token of the
        covenant which contained all the promises that God had made to Abraham,
        saying, ‘My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting
        covenant.’ Could it be supposed that this rite, so solemnly enjoined and
        collected with such privileges, and his other good works, had no
        procuring influence in Abraham’s justification? Such is the objection
        which it is supposed in this first verse would occur to the Jews, and is
        therefore stated by the Apostle, which he fully answers in the sequel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to
        glory; but not before God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term ‘works’ is here explanatory of the word flesh in the first
        verse, signifying any works, whether moral or ceremonial. If Abraham
        were justified on account of his works, as the Jews believed, it must be
        admitted that he had something to boast of, contrary to what the Apostle
        had just before declared, that all boasting on such grounds is excluded,
        whose doctrine, consequently, must be set aside. Than this, no objection
        that could be offered would appear to the Jews more forcible; it was
        therefore important to advert to it. Being, however, entirely
        groundless, the Apostle at once repels it, and replies to the question
        previously proposed, respecting circumcision, or any work or privilege,
        in that prompt and brief manner of which we see an example at the end of
        the 8th verse of the former chapter. He answers, But not before God.
        Abraham had no ground of boasting before God, not having been justified
        either by the observance of the rite of circumcision, or by any other
        work of obedience which he had performed; and this Paul fully proves in
        the sequel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
        covered unto him for righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having denied in the foregoing verse that Abraham was justified, or had
        any ground of boasting, either on account of his circumcision or his
        obedience, Paul next supports his denial by an appeal to Scripture,
        which was calculated to carry stronger conviction to the Jews than all
        things else he could have alleged. His proof is drawn from the
        historical records of the Old Testament, and thus he sets his seal to
        its complete verbal inspiration, quoting what is there recorded as the
        decision of God; yet some who profess to receive the Bible as the word
        of God, deny that portion of it to be inspired! His meaning, then, by
        the question, What saith the Scripture? is, that God Himself, by His own
        word, has decided this matter; for the fact is there declared that
        Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
        This quotation is taken from Genesis 15:6, where the promise to Abraham
        is recorded that his seed should be innumerable as the stars of heaven,
        being the renewal of the promise, Genesis 12:2, when he was called out
        of his own country. It thus comprehended the truth announced to him at
        different times, that all the nations of the world should be blessed in
        his seed, that is, in the Messiah, Galatians 3:16.
      </p>
      <p>
        That promise referred to the one made to our first parents after the
        fall, in which was included the hope of redemption to be accomplished by
        the Deliverer of mankind, who was to spring from him, as God declared to
        Abraham. The above passage, then, according to Paul, proves that the
        righteousness of God is received by faith, and is an example of the
        testimony that is rendered to it by the law. It refutes the opinion of
        those who, misunderstanding the manner in which the Apostle James
        expresses himself, affirm that a man is first justified only by faith,
        but afterwards by works which flow from faith. And it was counted to him
        for righteousness, rather, unto righteousness. — It is not instead of
        righteousness, as this translation for righteousness has led many to
        suppose. By faith a man becomes truly righteous. Faith is the recipient
        of that righteousness by which we are justified. Unto righteousness is
        the literal rendering, as the same word in the original is so often
        translated in this discussion, as where it is said, ch. 1:16, the Gospel
        is the power of God unto salvation; and ch. 3:22, even the righteousness
        of God which is unto all; and so in innumerable other places, but
        especially in a passage precisely parallel to the one before us, ch.
        10:10, ‘For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.’ This is
        the signification of the phrase in the verse before us, which ought to
        have been translated in the same way. The expression ‘unto
        righteousness’ is elliptical, and signifies unto the receiving of
        righteousness. In the different French translations, the meaning of the
        original is properly expressed à justice;’ that is, to, or unto
        righteousness; and in the same way in the Vulgate, ‘ad justitiam,’ to
        righteousness; and in this meaning is fixed down definitely by the
        verses immediately succeeding, where the Apostle introduces a passage
        from the Psalm in illustration of the manner in which Abraham and his
        spiritual seed are justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        That faith is not itself the justifying righteousness, is demonstrably
        evident from the phraseology of many passages that speak of faith and
        righteousness in the same place. ‘Even the righteousness of God, which
        is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe.’
        Here righteousness is supposed to be one thing, and faith to be another.
        Can language more expressly show that righteousness and faith are two
        different things, for two different purposes, though always found united
        in the same persons, and both equally necessary? Righteousness is what
        we want in order to justification; faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, as
        testified in the Gospel, is the means through which we receive this
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believing, then, is not the righteousness, but it is the means through
        which we become righteous. In like manner, in Romans 10:10, above
        quoted, the Apostle says, ‘For with the heart man believeth unto
        righteousness.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Here it is necessarily implied that faith is not righteousness, but that
        it in the means through which we receive righteousness. Nothing, then,
        can be a greater corruption of the truth than to represent faith itself
        as accepted instead of righteousness, or to be the righteousness that
        saves the sinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is not righteousness. Righteousness is the fulfilling of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse, connected with the following, proves, like the 28th verse of
        the foregoing chapter, that faith is opposed to works, and not
        considered as a work in the matter of justification. Yet many speak of
        the excellence of Abraham’s faith in such a way as to represent the
        patriarch to be saved by faith as a work — as the most excellent of all
        works. Mr. Tholuck advances many observations on this subject that are
        altogether unscriptural, discovering most erroneous views of the Gospel.
        He quotes various passages from Philo, which he calls ‘beautiful,’ in
        which Philo extols faith as ‘the queen of virtues,’ ‘the price of every
        blessing;’ and adds, ‘and well is it said that faith was counted to him
        (Abraham) for righteousness.’ Here Philo exhibits faith as the
        righteousness by which Abraham was justified — the price of that
        blessing. Mr. Tholuck says, ‘ Dikaiosu>nh (righteousness) denotes here
        subjective holiness. God looked upon Abraham’s childlike submission as
        if it were real holiness, and attached value to it alone.’ A greater
        perversion of Scripture, or a sentiment more directly opposed to the
        meaning of the passage and to all the Apostle is proving in the context,
        and has been laboring to prove throughout the whole of his previous
        discussion from the 16th verse of the first chapter, as well as
        subversive of the grand doctrine of justification, cannot be imagined.
        If Abraham was justified by faith as a ‘price, ’ or ‘as righteousness,’
        — an expression which Mr. Tholuck employs again and again, — then he was
        justified by faith as a work, ‘as if it were real holiness,’ and God is
        thus represented as attaching a value to faith which does not belong to
        it! In opposition to such unscriptural and fallacious statements, which
        at once make void the law and the Gospel, we are here taught that
        Abraham was not justified by faith, either as a price, or as a virtue,
        or as if it were really righteousness, but as the appointed medium of
        receiving righteousness, even the righteousness of God. This fundamental
        error of Mr. Tholuck and Mr. Stuart, and long ago of Socinus, that
        faith, although it is really not righteousness, is reckoned by God as
        righteousness, is most dishonorable to the character of God, and
        derogatory to His holy law. That law, which is a transcript of His own
        unchangeable nature, can acknowledge nothing as its fulfillment but
        perfect conformity to all its requirements. Nor did the Gospel come to
        pour dishonor upon it by modifying its demands, or to substitute another
        law for it, making faith meritorious. And besides, the nature of faith
        will not admit of this, for it excludes boasting. It implies a fleeing
        out of one’s self, and our own performances, — it consists in looking to
        another as the bestower of eternal salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight has a long note on this verse, which is also directly
        opposed to the Apostle’s doctrine of justification. ‘In judging
        Abraham,’ he says, ‘God will place on the one side of the account his
        duties, and on the other his performances . And on the side of his
        performances he will place his faith, and by mere favor will value it as
        equal to a complete performance of his duties, and reward him as if he
        were a righteous person.
      </p>
      <p>
        But neither here, nor in Galatians 3:6, is it said that Christ’s
        righteousness was counted to Abraham. In both passages the expression
        is, Abraham believed God, and it, viz., his believing God, was counted
        to him for righteousness. — Further, as it is nowhere said in Scripture
        that Christ’s righteousness was imputed to Abraham, so neither is it
        said anywhere that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers.’
        These statements, affirming that God, in judging Abraham, will place on
        the one side of the account his duties, and on the other his
        performances, and by mere favor will value faith as equal to a complete
        performance of his duties, argue most deplorable ignorance of the whole
        plan of salvation. The assertion, that it is nowhere said in Scripture
        that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to believers, is directly
        contrary to fact. It is contradicted by the whole strain of Scripture
        relating to the subject, and expressly by the Apostle Peter, in his
        address to them that have obtained like precious faith with us, in the
        righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ, <610101> Peter 1:1.
        (This is the literal rendering.) And also by the Prophet Jeremiah 23:6,
        by whom Jesus Christ is called the Lord our righteousness. But by such
        groundless assertions does Dr. Macknight misrepresent the character of
        God, and labors to banish from the Bible the doctrine of the imputation
        of Christ’s righteousness, without which, consistently with the
        perfections of God and the demands of the law, there could be no
        salvation. He misunderstands, too, the meaning of the expression, for
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Now to him that worketh in the reward not reckoned of grace,
        but of debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some understand this as implying working perfectly — doing all that a
        man is bound to do. But this is contrary to the meaning: it applies to
        work of any kind, and excludes all working of every kind or degree. No
        reward can be said to be of grace that is given for work of any
        description. Abraham did not obtain righteousness by faith as a good
        disposition, or by counting that disposition above its value. Had
        Abraham been justified by faith as an act or disposition worthy of
        approbation, or by anything whatsoever that he had done, he would have
        been justified by works, and might have boasted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that
        justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        But to him that worketh not. — This is entirely misunderstood by Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight and Mr. Stuart, as if it meant, according to Dr. Macknight,
        ‘one who does not work all that he is bound to do;’ or according to Mr.
        Stuart, ‘the sinner who has not exhibited perfect obedience.’ It means,
        however, what it literally expresses, namely, that the person who is
        justified does not work at all for his justification. It is not that he
        does not perform all the works that he ought, but that for justification
        he does nothing. It is true that he works, but not for justification.
        Mr. Tholuck, who likewise misunderstands in this place the whole of the
        Apostle’s argument, seems to think that the case of Abraham is only an
        analogy, and not an example of justification by faith. But Abraham’s
        faith respected the Messiah, whose day he saw afar off, and by His
        righteousness he was justified. Justifieth the ungodly. — If the
        expression, ‘to him that worketh not,’ needed any explanation, this term
        — the ungodly — would place its meaning beyond all doubt. The term
        ungodly is applied throughout the Scriptures to wicked men, Romans 5:6;
        1 Timothy 1:9; 1 Peter 4:18; 2 Peter 2:5, 3:7; Jude 4, 15. Men are
        ungodly in themselves, though, as soon as they are justified, they cease
        to be ungodly. They are ungodly till they believe; but in the moment
        that they receive the gift of faith, they are thereby united to the
        Savior, and are instantly invested with the robe of righteousness, and
        also partake, according to the measure of their faith, of all those
        other graces that are received out of His fullness.
      </p>
      <p>
        They then pass from death to life, — a transition in which there is no
        medium; they are turned from darkness to light, and from the power of
        Satan unto God; for till then, being without Christ, they are the
        children of the devil. They cannot at the same time be both dead and
        alive — under the power of God, and under the power of the devil; they
        must in every instant of their existence be either under the one or the
        other. In that moment, then, in which they believe, they are justified;
        and to justify, signifies not to treat men as if they were just or
        righteous, though they are not so, but because they are in truth
        righteous by imputation, really righteous, the law having been fulfilled
        in them, ch. 8:4. In this Professors Tholuck and Stuart most grossly
        err. To justify, with them, is not to acquit as being perfectly
        righteous, but to hold men to be righteous when they are not righteous.
        The expression, justifieth the ungodly, Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight says, ‘does not imply that Abraham was an ungodly person when
        he was justified; the Apostle’s meaning is, justifieth Him who had been
        ungodly.’ This is making, not explaining Scripture. It entirely sets
        aside the Apostle’s declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is much to be regretted that it should be necessary to introduce the
        name of Mr. Scott in connection with such writers as Macknight, Stuart,
        and Tholuck. As an expositor of Scripture, he deserves to be spoken of
        in terms very different from any of them; but an impartial regard for
        the interest of truth requires that his very erroneous remarks on the
        passage last referred to should not pass unnoticed. Mr. Scott’s note, in
        his Commentary on this expression, ‘justifieth the ungodly,’ is
        incorrect, and his ideas on the subject are confused, Contrary to the
        Apostle, he asserts that a man is not ‘absolutely ungodly at the time of
        his justification.’ It is true, as has been observed, that the moment a
        man is justified, he is godly; but the question is, if he be godly or
        ungodly in the moment which precedes his justification? If he be godly
        before, then the words of the Apostle are false; and the contrary, that
        God justifies the godly, would be true. But Mr. Scott’s views on this
        point are very erroneous, as appears from his remarks on Cornelius, in
        his note preceding the verse before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, ‘Even the proposition, Good works are the fruits of faith, and
        follow after faith, in Christ, though a general truth, may admit of some
        exception, in such cases as that of Cornelius.’ This contradicts the
        12th and 13th articles of his church, to which he appears to refer; but
        what is of more consequence, his statement explicitly contradicts the
        whole tenor of the Holy Scriptures, and of the plan of redemption. The
        case of Cornelius forms no exception, nor does it contain even the
        shadow of an exception to the truth declared in the verse we are
        considering. Mr. Scott closes his note on Acts 10:1,2, by remarking,
        ‘Perhaps these observations may assist the reader in understanding this
        instructing chapter, which cannot easily be made to accord with the
        exactness of systematically writers on these subjects.’ Now there is not
        the smallest difficulty in showing that all which that chapter contains
        is in exact accordance with every other part of Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Scott, after some further remarks on the justification of the
        ungodly, says, ‘Nay, the justified believer, whatever his holiness or
        diligence may be, never works for this purpose, and he still comes
        before God as ungodly in this respect.’ This is incorrect. He always
        comes as a sinner; that is, as one who is daily, hourly, and every
        moment sinning. And when he comes so, he comes as he is; for this is
        truth. But he is not ungodly after he believes, which is a character
        belonging only to the enemies of God. The Christian, then, cannot in any
        respect come in such a character, for he cannot come in a character that
        is no longer his. There is an essential difference between coming to God
        as a sinner, and coming to Him as ungodly. ‘Abraham,’ Mr. Scott
        subjoins, ‘several years before, by faith obeyed the call and command of
        God, and therefore could not be, strictly speaking, altogether ungodly,
        when it was said, “He believed God, and it was counted to him for
        righteousness;” so that the example of Abraham alone is a full and clear
        refutation of the construction by some put upon this text, that men are
        altogether and in every sense ungodly and unregenerate at the time when
        God justifies them, — a sentiment of most dangerous tendency.’ The
        assertion of the Apostle is, that God justifies the ungodly, which can
        have no other meaning than that men are ungodly in the moment that
        precedes their justification. It is truly astonishing that the example
        of Abraham should be referred to as a full and clear refutation of the
        plain and obvious construction of this assertion of the Apostle, which
        it never can be of dangerous tendency implicitly to believe. The danger
        lies in not receiving it, and in raising difficulties and objections
        which obscure and neutralize a declaration, the meaning of which is so
        clear and manifest. This must always have the effect, as in the case
        before us, of leading into most palpable error, inconsistency, and
        misrepresentation of the Divine testimony. If Abraham was godly before
        the time when it was recorded that he believed God, and it was counted
        to him for righteousness, he was also a believer before that time, and
        justified before that time, although his justification was then first
        recorded. The limitations, therefore, ‘strictly speaking,’ and
        ‘altogether ungodly,’ which Mr. Scott introduces, are entirely
        misplaced. He was not ungodly at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        To intimate, as Mr. Scott does, that Abraham was not a justified
        believer till the period when it is recorded that his faith was counted
        to him for righteousness, is to say that a man may exercise strong
        faith, and obey God, and walk in communion with Him, long before he is
        justified, which is to overturn the doctrine of justification. But no
        such confusion and discrepancies are to be found in the Scriptures.
        When, in the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews, the Apostle illustrates
        his declaration in the end of the tenth chapter, that the just shall
        live by faith, he affirms that ‘By faith, Abraham, when he was called to
        go out into a place, which he should after receive for an inheritance,
        obeyed.’ If, then, faith justifies, as the Apostle is there showing,
        Abraham was justified by faith when he ‘departed as the Lord had spoken
        to him,’ Genesis 12:4, many years before the time of the declaration
        recorded in Genesis 15:6. On the whole, there is not a spark of
        godliness in any man before he is united to Christ; and the moment he is
        united to Him, he is for ever justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 4th and 5th verses before us, the distinction between receiving a
        reward for works, and receiving it through faith, is clearly
        established. In the first case, a man receives what is due to him as his
        wages; in the second, all comes in the way of favor. Here also faith and
        works are directly opposed to each other. To preserve the doctrine of
        these verses from abuse, it is only necessary to recollect that works
        are denied as having anything to do in justification, but that they are
        absolutely necessary in the life of the believer. ‘Works,’ says Luther,
        ‘are not taken into consideration when the question respects
        justification. But true faith will no more fail to produce them than the
        sun can cease to give light. But it is not on account of works that God
        justifies us.’ ‘We offer nothing to God,’ says Calvin; ‘but we are
        prevented by His grace altogether free, without His having any respect
        to our works.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Men are prone to magnify one part of the Divine counsel, by disparaging
        or denying another, which to their wisdom appears to stand in opposition
        to it. Some speak of faith in such a manner as to disparage works;
        others are so zealous for works as to disparage faith; while some, in
        order to honor both, confound them together. The Apostle Paul gives
        every truth its proper value and its proper place. In this Epistle he
        establishes the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and speaks not
        of the fruits of faith till the fifth chapter. But these fruits he shows
        to be the necessary result of that faith which justifies.
      </p>

        Ver. 6. — Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
        whom God imputeth righteousness without works.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the blessing of the pardon of sin cannot be separated from our being
        viewed as perfectly righteous in the sight of God, Paul further confirms
        his doctrine by a reference to the <193201> 32nd Psalm, which gives the
        meaning of David’s words. In this manner one part of Scripture is
        employed to open and explain what is said in another part. Imputeth. —
        The same word in the original, which in verses 3, 4, 5, is rendered
        counted or reckoned, is here rendered imputed. All of them bear the same
        meaning, of placing to the believer’s account the righteousness of Jesus
        Christ, called in ch. 5:19 His ‘obedience.’ ‘Here we see,’ says Calvin,
        ‘the mere cavil of those who limit the works of the law within
        ceremonial rites, since what before were denominated works of the law
        are now called works simply, and without an adjunct. The simple and
        unrestricted language occurring in this passage, which all readers must
        understand as applying indifferently to every kind of work, must for
        ever conclude the whole of this dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        For nothing is more inconsistent than to deprive ceremonies alone of the
        power of justifying, when Paul excludes works indefinitely.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression ‘imputeth righteousness without works,’ is important, as
        it clearly ascertains that the phrase ‘for righteousness, literally unto
        righteousness, signifies unto the receiving of righteousness. It
        signifies receiving righteousness itself, not a substitute for
        righteousness, nor a thing of less value than righteousness, which is
        accounted or accepted as righteousness. In Dr. Macknight’s note,
        however, on verse 3rd, already quoted, where he is laboring to prove
        that faith is countedFOR righteousness, or, according to Mr. Stuart and
        Mr. Tholuck,AS righteousness, he affirms, as has been observed, that God
        values faith as equal to complete performance of duty, and that it is
        nowhere said in Scripture that Christ’s righteousness is imputed to
        believers. The verse before us contains no explicit refutation of these
        unscriptural statements, which subvert not only the whole of the
        apostle’s reasoning on the doctrine of justification, but the whole
        doctrine of salvation. The righteousness here said to be imputed is that
        righteousness to which Paul had all along been referring, even the
        righteousness of God on account of the revelation of which the Gospel is
        the power of God unto salvation, and which, as has been noticed above,
        is by the Apostle Peter called the righteousness of our God and Savior
        Jesus Christ, in which believers have obtained precious faith. That the
        apostle refers in the verse before us to this righteousness which
        fulfills the law, is evident, if we look back to what he says in the
        21st verse of the preceding chapter, and to what he continues to say
        respecting it onwards to this 6th verse, and to the effect he here
        ascribes to it . If any one can suppose that all this is insufficient to
        settle the question, I shall produce an argument which is unanswerable,
        and which all the ingenuity of man is unable to gainsay It must be the
        righteousness of God (or the righteousness of Christ, which is the same)
        that is here spoken of BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER RIGHTEOUSNESS ON EARTH.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say with the above writers, that the God of truth values anything ‘as
        equal to the complete performance of duty,’ which is not so in reality,
        is to give a most unworthy, not to say a blasphemous, representation of
        His character. Far different are the following sentiments of Dr. Owen in
        his treatise On Justification. ‘ The sinner is not accepted as if he
        were righteous, but because in Christ Jesus he is so. The majesty of the
        law is not sacrificed; its requirements are fulfilled in their exceeding
        breadth; its penalty is endured in all its awfulness. And thus, from the
        meeting of mercy and loving-kindness with justice and judgment, there
        shines a most excellent glory, of which the full demonstration to men,
        and angels, and all the rational creatures of God, shall fill up the
        cycles of eternity.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart comes far short of the truth when he represents the Apostle
        as here confirming his doctrine by the case of David, as a second
        example or single instance. David is appealed to by Paul, not in respect
        to his own justification, but as to the doctrine which he taught with
        respect to this subject in one of his Psalm, where he speaks as he was
        moved by the Holy Ghost. He is here teaching how all are justified, who
        ever were, or ever shall be justified. It is, then, much more than a
        second example. It is the declaration of God himself, who spoke by the
        mouth of His servant David, Acts 4:25. The effect of Mr. Stuart’s
        misunderstanding the expression, ‘the righteousness of God,’ ch. 1:17,
        and 3:21, and ascribing to it the signification of ‘the justification
        which God bestows,’ is, in his explanation of the verse before us, as in
        so many other places, abundantly evident. Although compelled here to
        attach to the original word its proper meaning of righteousness, instead
        of ‘justification,’ the vagueness of the meaning he had, as above, so
        erroneously ascribed to it, leaves an opening for explaining it to be a
        fictitious righteousness belonging to faith itself, instead of a real
        righteousness, namely, the righteousness of Christ received by faith.
        ‘Here,’ he says, ‘and elsewhere in this chapter, where the same
        phraseology occurs, it is evident that the word is not to be understood
        in the sense of justification, which is the most common meaning of it in
        our Epistle.’ So far from this being its most common meaning, it is not
        even once its meaning out of no fewer than thirty-six times in which it
        occurs in this Epistle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart’s views on the all-important subject of justification, are
        not only completely erroneous and unscriptural, but such as they are, he
        holds them in a manner so confused and indistinct, that he alternately
        asserts and contradicts what he has advanced. He one while speaks of
        faith as ‘not of itself such an act of obedience to the Divine law, as
        that it will supply the place of perfect obedience.’ ‘Nor has it,’ he
        adds, ‘any efficacy in itself, as a meritum ex condigno to save men; it
        is merely the instrument of union to Christ, in order that they may
        receive a gratuitous salvation,’ p. 176. At other times, he speaks as if
        faith were accepted at a rate much above its value, and that the
        justification of a sinner is gratuitous because of such acceptance.
        ‘Their faith,’ he says, ‘was gratuitously reckoned as equivalent to the
        dikaiosu>nh (righteousness) demanded by the law.’ Here faith itself is
        made the ground of justification, and taken at a value far above its
        intrinsic worth. But faith is in no point of view equivalent to the
        obedience the law requires. It is Christ’s obedience that is taken as an
        equivalent to an obedience to the law; and for the best of all reasons,
        because it is an equivalent. The value of faith is, that by the Divine
        appointment it is the medium of union with Christ. If it be true that
        faith is ‘merely’ an instrument of union to Christ, in order that we may
        receive a gratuitous salvation, as, in one of these passages, Mr. Stuart
        asserts, how is it that faith was gratuitously reckoned as equivalent to
        the righteousness demanded by the law? If faith be accepted as an
        equivalent to righteousness, then it cannot be merely the medium of
        connecting us with Christ. He observes, p. 177, ‘To say, was counted
        (namely, their faith) for justification, would make no tolerable sense;
        but to say, was counted as complete obedience, would be saying just what
        the Apostle means to say, viz., that the believer is gratuitously
        justified.’ And again, he affirms that faith ‘is counted as
        righteousness,’ p. 172. Here and in other places the imputation of
        Christ’s righteousness for the justification of a sinner is excluded by
        Mr. Stuart, as it is by Dr. Macknight. Mr. Stuart’s self-contradictions,
        contained in his Commentary, are noticed in the following term sin the
        American theological magazine, called The Biblical Repertory, of July
        1833, where it is reviewed. ‘Respected sir, you admit what you deny, and
        deny what you admit, in such rapid succession, your readers are
        bewildered.’
      </p>
      <p>
        According, then, to these statements, righteousness, that is, the
        righteousness of Christ, which does indeed fulfill the demands of the
        law, is not imputed to the believer for justification — although this is
        explicitly asserted in the text, when it is said, ‘God imputeth
        righteousness,’ for on earth, as has been observed there is no other
        righteousness — while faith, which does not fulfill so much as one of
        its demands, is reckoned as equivalent to all its demands; and besides,
        righteousness is thus counted to a man as belonging to him, which ‘in
        reality does not belong to him.’ And this, we are told by Mr. Stuart, is
        ‘just what the Apostle means to say.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul affirms that God is just when He justifies him that believeth. But,
        according to Mr. Stuart, in thus representing God as counting for a
        reality what is a mere figment, and counting ‘something’ to a man ‘which
        does not belong to him,’ not a trace of anything that has even the
        semblance of justice in a sinner’s justification is left. And on these
        grounds, salvation is asserted by him to be ‘gratuitous!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart considers that the mercy of God, for Christ’s sake, accepts
        believers as just, while they are not so in reality. This overturns the
        Gospel and the justice of the Divine character. It destroys both law and
        Gospel. If a man is not truly just, God cannot account him just, nor
        treat him as just. Why cannot Mr. Stuart see believers perfectly just in
        Jesus Christ, their head and substitute? But this is what might be
        expected from one who cannot see the human race guilty in Adam. It is
        quite natural, then, that he should not see believers righteous in
        Christ. According to Mr. Stuart, God is not a just God in saving
        sinners, for He acquits as just those whom He knows to be unjust. He
        represents God as an unjust God in punishing the innocent, for He visits
        with suffering and death infants, who are supposed innocent of Adam’s
        sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the doctrine of the Apostle, when a sinner is justified, it
        is by the imputation of righteousness — not a fictitious, but a real
        righteousness. The believer, in his union with Christ, is viewed as
        perfectly righteous, because in truth he is so, for the righteousness of
        God is ‘upon him,’ ch. 3:22; Jehovah is his righteousness, Jeremiah
        23:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is therefore just in justifying him; and in the day of judgment the
        Great Judge will pronounce him ‘righteous,’ Matthew 25:37-46, and award
        to him ‘a crowd of righteousness,’ according to the strictest justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gift of this righteousness, with the justification it brings along
        with it, is indeed perfectly gratuitous, and the manner of bestowing it
        is gratuitous — freely by grace; but ‘grace reigns through
        righteousness,’ Romans 5:21, — in that way which meets every demand of
        law and justice. This last is a most important declaration, with which
        the Apostle closes his discussion on the doctrine of justification; but
        important as it is, Mr. Stuart has altogether mistaken its meaning, and
        misrepresented it in the same way as he has misrepresented the
        corresponding expression at the opening of this discussion, ch. 1:17.
        Had he understood it, he would not have perverted the Apostle’s
        reasoning as he has done, and propounded sentiments respecting the
        all-important doctrine of justification which annihilate the glory of
        that redemption in which righteousness and peace have kissed each other,
        — sentiments which compromise the justice, and dishonor the character of
        God. ‘Faith,’ says Mr. Bell, in his View of the Covenants , p. 226,
        ‘rests upon Christ alone It in effect excludes itself as a work in the
        matter of justification. It is not a thing upon which a sinner rests; it
        is his resting on the Surety. Therefore, that man who would bring in his
        faith as a part of his justifying righteousness before God, thereby
        proves that he has no faith in Jesus Christ. He comes as with a lie in
        his right hand; for such is the absurdity, that he trusts in the act of
        faith, not in its object, — i.e., he believes in his faith, not in Jesus
        Christ. Having taken Christ, as he pretends, he would have that very act
        whereby he received Him sustained at the Divine tribunal as his
        righteousness. Thus Christ is bid to stand at a distance, and the
        sinner’s own act is by himself bid to come near in the case of
        justification. This is nothing else but works under another name. It is
        not faith, for that necessarily establishes grace.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
        whose sins are covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse, in connection with the preceding, shows that sins are not
        forgiven, except in a way in which righteousness is imputed. Anciently,
        the high priest was appointed to bless the people, Numbers 6:24, as the
        type of Jesus Christ, who, as the Great High Priest, imparts a real
        blessedness. ‘Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in
        Christ.’ In Him it was promised that all nations should be blessed. When
        about to ascend into heaven, He lifted up His hands and blessed His
        disciples; and at the last day He will, from the throne of His glory,
        pronounce all His people the blessed of His Father. On that day, and not
        till then, shall any of them be able fully to comprehend all that is
        implied in this term in the verse before us. Blessed are they. — ’
        Blessed is he’ (the man), says David ‘whose transgression is forgiven.’
        David speaks of one person, but Paul speaks of many. This alteration
        which the Apostle makes should not be overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work of redemption being now finished, the Apostle is commissioned
        by the Holy Ghost, who dictated the words, thus to include for their
        encouragement the whole mystical body of Christ, — all that are His,
        whether Jews or Gentiles. Covered — This appears to be in allusion to
        the mercy-seat, which covered the law. Sins must be covered before they
        can be forgiven. There must be a way in which this is done according to
        justice. This way is by the blood of Christ; and he that is dead with
        Him is justified from sin, Romans 6:7. His sins are for ever covered, as
        being cast into the depths of the sea, Micah 7:19. They are blotted out
        with the, Savior’s blood. ‘I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy
        transgressions for Mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins,’
        Isaiah 43:25. He is saved from the guilt of sin immediately on his
        believing. The righteousness of the Savior being imputed to the sinner,
        none of his own unrighteousness can attach to him; the imputation of
        both cannot take place. There is a full remission of his past sins, and
        none which he shall afterwards commit shall be judicially laid to his
        charge, Romans 8:33. Being stripped of the filthy garments, and clothed
        with a change of raiment, Zechariah 3:4, as certain as God is
        unchangeable, it shall never be taken off him. ‘He hath clothed me with
        the garments of salvation; He hath covered me with the robe of
        righteousness,’ Isaiah 61:10. ‘I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
        remember their sin no more,’ Jeremiah 31:34. ‘As far as the east is from
        the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us, <19A312>
        Psalm 103:12. ‘Wearied at length,’ says Luther, ‘with your own
        righteousness, rejoice and confide in the righteousness of Christ.
        Learn, my dear brother, to know Christ, and Christ crucified, and learn
        to despair of thyself and to the Lord this song: — Lord Jesus! Thou art
        my righteousness, but I am Thy sin. Thou hast taken what belonged to me;
        Thou hast given me what was Thine. Thou becamest what Thou wert not in
        order that I was not myself.’
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 8. — Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</p>
      <p>
        Righteousness is imputed when sin is not imputed, for we here see that
        the man to whom sin is not imputed is blessed. As Jesus was accursed,
        Galatians 3:13, when the sins of His people were imputed to Him, so they
        are blessed when His righteousness is imputed to them. Justification, or
        the judgment of God by which He renders us ‘blessed,’ consists of two
        acts, by one of which He pardons our sins, by the other He gives us the
        kingdom. This appears in the sequel of this chapter, where we see that
        the justification of Abraham includes the promise of making him heir of
        the world, ver. 13; and this truth the Apostle establishes not only in
        the person of Abraham, but also extends it to all the people of God,
        ver. 16. In the eighth chapter of this Epistle, where Paul joins
        together the Divine calling and justification, he also connects
        justification and glorification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards he adds, ‘What shall we then say to these things? If God be
        for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but
        delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give
        us all things’ The expression, God is for us, marks the effect of
        justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not said, God is not against us, as should be said if
        justification was only the pardon of sin; but God is for us, — which
        signifies that He not only pardons but blesses us, giving us a right to
        the kingdom. He not only delivers us from being children of wrath, but
        adopts us into His family, and makes us His own children. When He
        discharges us from the pains of the second death, He destines us to the
        glory of heaven. The words that follow, respecting the delivering up of
        His Son, and freely giving us all things, clearly import these two great
        acts of pardon and blessing. The same is also declared by the Prophet
        Malachi 3:17, ‘And they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that
        day when I make up My jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth
        his own son.’ Justification, then, corresponds to the righteousness of
        God, by the imputation of which it is received. By that righteousness
        the penalty of the law is fulfilled, which secures the pardon of sin,
        and also the precept on account of which the inheritance is awarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or
        upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to
        Abraham for righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle having fully established the truth, that a man is justified
        by faith without works, now reverts to the allusion made to circumcision
        at the beginning of this chapter, in demanding what Abraham had obtained
        as pertaining to the flesh. He now shows, in the most decisive manner,
        that Abraham had not obtained justification by means of circumcision,
        since he was justified before he was circumcised. And, proceeding to
        prove what he had affirmed, ch. 3:30, that justification is not confined
        to the Jews, he asks if the blessedness he had spoken of comes only to
        those who are circumcised, or to the uncircumcised also. It was the more
        necessary to decide this question, because the Jews not only believed
        that justification depended, at least in part, on their works, but that
        the privileges of the people of God were inseparably connected with
        circumcision. In the sequel Paul shows that justification has no
        necessary connection with, or dependence on, circumcision. For we say. —
        This is not the language of an objector, as Mr. Stuart supposes; it is
        the position which the Apostle lays down for the purpose of establishing
        his conclusion. The fact that faith was counted to Abraham unto
        righteousness, is the groundwork on which he builds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
        uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
        How was it? or in what circumstances was righteousness counted to him? —
        This question, with the affirmation which follows, determines that
        Abraham’s justification by faith was previous to circumcision, and
        therefore circumcision could not be its cause. If righteousness was
        imputed to him before he was circumcised, then circumcision is not
        necessary to justification. It may come on Gentiles as well as on Jews.
        This is founded on the history of Abraham, recorded in the Old
        Testament, who was in a state of justification before Ishmael’s birth,
        many years antecedent to the appointment of circumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
        righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he
        might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not
        circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also . f24
        If, then, Abraham was justified in uncircumcision, for what purpose, it
        might be asked, was he circumcised? It is replied, that he received
        circumcision, which was appointed as a figure or sign of his paternity,
        literally with respect to a numerous seed, and spiritually of all
        believers. It intimated that He in whom all the families of the earth
        should be blessed, was to spring from Abraham. This blessedness is
        described by David as consisting, in the imputation of righteousness
        without works. But this was not all: circumcision was not only a sign,
        but a seal of that righteousness which was imputed to Abraham through
        faith while he was uncircumcised.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not mean, as is generally understood, that it was a seal of
        Abraham’s faith. This is not said. It is said that it was a seal of the
        ‘righteousness’ of the faith which he had; that is, a seal of that
        righteousness itself, namely, the righteousness of God, which he had
        received by his faith. It was a seal, assurance, or pledge that the
        righteousness , by the imputation of which, through his faith, he was
        justified, although not then in existence, should in its appointed
        period be brought in . Circumcision, then, being such a seal or pledge,
        and as the appointment of Abraham as the father of Christ, by whom this
        righteousness was to be introduced, included his being the father of the
        line from which Christ was to spring, it was to be affixed to his
        posterity, and not to cease to be so till the thing signified was
        accomplished. Here, it would appear, we learn the reason why this seal
        was to be affixed on the eighth day after birth. On the eighth day, the
        first day of the week, when Jesus, the seed of Abraham, arose from the
        dead, that righteousness, of which circumcision was a seal or pledge,
        was accomplished. In reference to this, and to the change respecting the
        Sabbath from the seventh to the eighth day, in consequence of His
        resurrection, when our Lord brought in the everlasting righteousness,
        and entered into His rest, the eighth day is in many ways distinguished
        throughout the Old Testament. That he might be the father , etc. — In
        order to his being the father. This, mark, then, was a sign of Abraham’s
        being the father of all believers, both Jews and Gentiles, to all of
        whom this righteousness was to be imputed. As it was a seal of the
        righteousness which he had received by the faith which he had in a state
        of uncircumcision, it implied that righteousness would be imputed to
        believers in the same state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
        circumcision only, but unto also walk in the steps of that faith of our
        father Abraham, which he had, being yet uncircumcised.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that there is a sense in which Abraham is a father of some
        of his descendants, in which he is not a father to others. To those of
        them who walk in the steps of his faith, he is a spiritual father. While
        all Abraham’s children were circumcised, he was not equally the father
        of them all. It was only to such of them as had his faith that he was a
        father in what is spiritually represented by circumcision. As it is
        said, ‘They are not all Israel which are of Israel; neither, because
        they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children; but in Isaac shall
        thy seed be called; that is, they which are the children of the flesh,
        these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are
        counted for the seed,’ Romans 9:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also established by our Lord Himself, who denied that the
        unbelieving Jews were the children of Abraham, John 8:39. He was,
        however, not only the father of his believing children, who were
        circumcised, but of all, in every nation, who walk in the steps of his
        faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believing Gentiles are therefore said to be grafted, contrary to nature,
        into a good olive tree, Romans 11:24; and to be Abraham’s seed,
        Galatians 3:29.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — For the promise, that he should be the heir of the word, was
        not to Abraham, or to his seed, through law, but through the
        righteousness of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here continues to prove that the blessing of justification is
        received through faith, and not in any other way. Heir of the world —
        The promise to Abraham included three things, — 1. That the promised
        seed of the woman should descend from him; 2. That all nations should be
        blessed in that seed; 3. That, as a pledge of all this, he and his seed
        should inherit the land of Canaan. ‘And I will give unto thee, and to
        thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land
        of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.’ Canaan, however, was but an
        emblem of the heavenly country, of which last only Abraham could have an
        everlasting possession; for he was a stranger on the earth, and Canaan
        was to him ‘a strange country,’ Hebrews 11:9.
      </p>
      <p>
        This he understood it to be, and accordingly to the former he looked
        forward as what was substantially promised, Hebrews 11:13,16. This was
        ‘that world,’ as it is designated by our Lord, Luke 20:35, — a
        possession so often called an inheritance, Hebrews 9:15; 1 Peter 1:4, of
        which not only Abraham, but also his spiritual posterity, were
        constituted heirs. They were to inherit all things, Revelation 21:7; and
        although the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain, yet all
        things are theirs, 1 Corinthians 3:21-23. Abraham, however, being the
        father or first heir according to that promise, he might properly, by
        way of distinction, be called ‘the heir,’ and on the same ground, the
        father of many nations, being the father of all God’s people; as is
        likewise promised in the covenant, which is so often referred to in this
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression ‘heir’ has a manifest relation to the title of children,
        which is given to the people of God in their adoption. It is on this
        account that Paul joins them together, — ’If children, then heirs, heirs
        of God, and joint heirs with Christ,’ Romans 8:17; by which he teaches
        that they have not only a right to the good things that God confers, but
        that they have right in virtue of their adoption, and not of their
        works. The birthright of a child, which gives him a right to the good
        things of his father, and distinguishes him from those who may gain them
        by their services, resembles the privilege conferred by the free and
        gratuitous adoption of God of His children. In conferring the right in
        this way, every pretension to merit is excluded; and as God, in the law,
        had rendered inheritances inalienable, such also is the inviolable
        stability of the inheritance which God confers. The grandeur of this
        inheritance is represented in Scripture by the appellations of a
        kingdom, Luke 12:32; of a crown, 2 Timothy 4:8; and of a throne,
        Revelation 3:21. Or to his seed — The covenant, in all its promises, and
        in its fullest extent, in reference to spiritual blessings, was
        established in Christ, who was emphatically and eminently Abraham’s
        seed, Galatians 3:16; and in Him, with all His members, who are the
        spiritual seed of Abraham, of whom the natural seed were typical, as the
        land of Canaan was typical of the heavenly inheritance. The promise to
        the seed was, that all nations should be blessed in Him, and this
        promise was made to Abraham also, as it implied that the Messiah was to
        be Abraham’s seed. The promise to Christ included all the children that
        God had given Him, who are in Him, and one with Him. These are all
        ‘joint heirs with Jesus Christ,’ Romans 8:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many are spoken of before Abraham as the children of God; but we do not
        read that the first promise respecting the seed, Genesis 3, was repeated
        to any of them. Though, in the time of Enos, men began to call
        themselves by the name of the Lord; though Enoch walked with God; though
        Noah was an heir of the righteousness which is by faith; though Jehovah
        was the God of Shem — it is not said that the promise of the seed was
        renewed to them. But to Abraham it was expressly renewed; and hence we
        see the reason why he is so frequently alluded to in the New Testament,
        and spoken of as the father of believers. Through the law. — Literally
        through law without the article. The Apostle had shown above that the
        blessing of righteousness came upon Abraham before he was circumcised,
        and here he shows that the promise that he should be the heir of the
        world was not made to him on account of any works of law, but through
        the righteousness received by faith. In this way Paul follows out his
        argument in proof that justification and the blessings connected with it
        were not the consequence either of circumcision or of personal
        obedience, but were received through faith. But through the
        righteousness of faith. — The righteousness of faith is an elliptical
        expression, meaning the righteousness which is received by faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the only way in which the promise, in order to prove effectual,
        could be given. ‘If there had been a law given which could have given
        life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the
        Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of
        Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.’ It was therefore to
        receive its accomplishment only by virtue of, and through the
        communication of, the righteousness received by faith. This is that
        righteousness which was counted or imputed to Abraham, when, upon the
        promise being made to him of a numerous seed, he believed in the Lord,
        Genesis 15:6. The inheritance comes solely in virtue of this
        righteousness to those who by it are ‘made righteous. ’ ‘They shall be
        called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He may be
        glorified,’ Isaiah 61:3. ‘Thy people shall be all righteous, they shall
        inherit the land for ever,’ Isaiah 60:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14, 15. — For if they which are of law be heirs, faith is made
        void, and the promise made of none effect: for the law worketh wrath:
        for where no law is there is no transgression.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it is said, ‘If they which are of law,’ that is, who by obeying the
        law of God be heirs, the case is supposed, as in ch. 2:13, 26, 27,
        though not admitted, which would be contrary to the whole train of the
        Apostle’s argument. If, however, possession of the inheritance come by
        obedience to law, then the obtaining it by faith is set aside, and
        consequently, as by works of law no man can be justified, the promise is
        made of none effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is entirely consistent with all the Apostle had said before
        respecting the manner in which the blessedness of Abraham had come upon
        him, solely by the imputation of righteousness received by faith,
        irrespective of any works of his. For the law worketh wrath. — It is
        indeed the nature of every law to afford opportunity of transgression.
        But this does not make it work wrath. It is law which is transgressed
        that works wrath. The Apostle had shown that by obedience to law no man
        can be justified, since all men are transgressors, and that the wrath of
        God is revealed against all unrighteousness; and this is what here he
        again declares. Such is the state of human nature, that the law of God,
        which all men transgress, so far from justifying them, can only work
        wrath, or punishment; for no law makes provision for the exercise of
        mercy, but requires perfect obedience to all its commands, and when this
        is not yielded, denounces wrath on every transgressor. For where no law
        is, there is no transgression. — This is the reason why the law works
        wrath. It gives occasion to transgress, and transgression brings wrath.
        And this, the Apostle asserts, is the nature of law in general. Where
        there is law, there is occasion or room for transgression. Where there
        is no law, there can be no breach of law. If a man could be placed in a
        situation without law, he would not be exposed to wrath as guilty; for
        as sin is the transgression of the law, so no transgression could be
        charged on him. This assertion, then, is equivalent to affirming that,
        considering the character of man, where law is there must be
        transgression, and only where there is no law there is no transgression,
        as it is said, ch. 5:13, ‘Sin is not imputed where there is no law.’
        From all this it follows, that if the fulfillment of the promise was
        dependent on man’s obedience to the law, the obtaining of the
        inheritance by faith would be made void, and so the promise would become
        of no effect; thus the possibility of obtaining the inheritance would be
        destroyed altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
        end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is
        of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is
        the father of us all, Having affirmed, in the end of the 13th verse,
        that the promise of the inheritance was not through obedience to law,
        but through the righteousness received by faith, and having in the 14th
        and 15th verses shown that it would not be obtained through obedience to
        law, Paul here proceeds to state why faith was appointed to be the way
        through which it should be carried into effect. Therefore it is of
        faith, that is might be by grace. — Since, then, the promise of the
        inheritance, that is, of eternal salvation, could not be fulfilled
        through obedience to law, it was appointed that it should be fulfilled
        through faith, because in this way it is effected by grace. A reward
        must be reckoned either of grace, or of debt, on account of works
        performed; and these cannot be combined. For ‘if by grace, then it is no
        more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace; but if it be of works,
        then is it no more grace; otherwise work is no more work,’ Romans 11:6.
        As the reward, then, could not be bestowed through the works of the law,
        of which every man is a transgressor, and which, therefore, could only
        work wrath to him, it must be conferred by grace through faith, which
        can in nowise be considered as meritorious, but is the gift of God, and
        simply receives His righteousness, opposed through the whole of this
        discussion to the works of man of every description. In this way, then,
        the promise is bestowed by grace. This accords with the whole plan of
        salvation, that regards man as a sinner, and according to which, as had
        been shown, ch. 3:27, boasting is excluded, and he is saved, not of
        works, but by grace through faith, Ephesians 2:8. In no other way, then,
        but through faith, could salvation have been by grace. Had it been
        bestowed in part or in whole as the reward of one good thought, it would
        not have been by grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul had before declared that they who have obtained the righteousness
        of God by faith are justified freely by His grace; and now he affirms
        that salvation is through faith, for this very purpose, that it might be
        by grace. To the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed. —
        The fulfillment of the promise to Abraham and to his seed not being
        grounded on obedience to law, which, in the case of every man, would
        have made it void, and as its fulfillment was determined by God, He has
        rested its accomplishment wholly on grace — His own gratuitous favor,
        which cannot be frustrated. Grace selects its objects, and its only
        motive is in God Himself The way, then, in which the promise was to be
        accomplished, depending on the sovereign will of God, who hath said, ‘My
        counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure,’ Isaiah 46:10, and
        whose gifts and calling are without repentance, was rendered secure, and
        the promise could not be made void by the unworthiness or mutability of
        man. Not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of
        the faith of Abraham. — The promise, then, was made sure by the grace of
        God, through faith, to all Abraham’s spiritual seed, not only to such as
        were ‘of the law,’ namely, his natural offspring under the legal
        dispensation, denominated in verses 9 and 12 the circumcision, but also
        to all of every nation who, though uncircumcised, possess his faith. To
        himself and to all of them it is accomplished through the righteousness
        of faith. Here it is worthy of observation, that none are supposed to be
        Abraham’s spiritual seed, or heirs as his seed, except believers,
        whether they ‘be his descendants or Gentiles. Who is the father of us
        all. — That is, the spiritual father both of Jewish and Gentile
        believers. He is equally in this sense the father of all believers. It
        is only by faith that he is the spiritual father of any.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many
        nations,) before Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
        dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, — According
        to the Apostle’s interpretation of this promise, it imports a numerous
        spiritual offspring, as well as a numerous natural posterity. It is not
        by way of what is called accommodation that this is said; it is the real
        interpretation of the promise, whether Abraham himself understood it so
        or not. This interpretation of the Apostle is a key to all that is said
        on this subject. It shows that Abraham had a double seed, that the
        promise had a double meaning, and both are distinctly verified. Thus,
        each of the three promises made to Abraham had a double fulfillment: —
        Of a numerous posterity; of God being a God to his seed; and of the
        earthly and heavenly country. Before Him. — At that moment, when he
        stood in the presence of God whom he believed, Genesis 17:4, he was made
        the father of all his natural and spiritual posterity; and though he was
        not then actually a father, yet, being so in the purpose of God, it was
        made as sure to him as if it had already taken place. God now willed it,
        and the result would follow as surely as creation followed His word.
        Quickeneth the dead. — Does this refer to the literal general fact of
        bringing the dead to life, or to Abraham’s body now dead, and Sarah’s
        incapacity of having children at her advanced age, or to the raising of
        Isaac had he been sacrificed? The first appears to be the meaning, and
        includes the others; and the belief of it is the ground on which the
        others rest. Faith in God’s power, as raising the dead, is a proper
        ground of believing any other work of power which God engages to
        perform, or which is necessary to be performed, in order to fulfill His
        word. If God raises the dead, why should Abraham look with distrust on
        his own body, or consider Sarah’s natural incapacity to bear children?
        Why should he doubt that God will fulfill His promise as to his numerous
        seed by Isaac, even though Isaac shall be slain? God could raise him
        from the dead. Calleth those things which be not as though they were. —
        This does not say that God calls into existence the things that exist
        not, as He calls into existence the things that are. But God speaks of
        the things that exist not, in the same way as He speaks of the things
        that exist; that is, He speaks of them as existing, though they do not
        then actually exiSt. And this is the way He spoke of Abraham as the
        father of many nations. I have made thee. — God calls him now a father,
        though he was not actually a father of many nations, because, before
        God, or in God’s counsel, he was such a father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — Who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the
        father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy
        seed be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Against hope, or beyond hope. — The thing was utterly beyond all that
        could be expected according to natural principles. In hope, or upon
        hope; that is, he believed the thing that was an object of hope. He
        believed the promise. Belief respects anything that is testified,
        whether desirable or otherwise. But the thing testified to Abraham was
        an object of hope, therefore he is said beyond hope to believe in hope.
        That he might become. — This is explained by some as importing that
        Abraham believed that he should become, etc.; that is, his becoming the
        father of many nations was the object of his belief. Others explain it,
        that he believed the promise in order that he might become; that is, his
        faith was the means through which the promise was to be made good to
        him. Both of these are true, but the last appears to be most agreeable
        to the expression, and is the more important sense. He was made such a
        father through faith. Had he not believed the promise, he would not have
        been made such a father. According to that which was spoken. — This
        shows that Abraham’s expectation rested solely on the Divine promise. He
        had no ground to hope for so numerous a posterity, or any posterity at
        all, except on the warrant of the promise of God. This he received in
        its true and obvious meaning, and did not, like many, explain away,
        modify, or fritter it down into something less wonderful. He hoped for
        the very thing which the words of the promise intimated, and to the very
        utmost extent of the meaning of these words, So shall thy seed be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
        now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the
        deadness of Sarah’s womb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not weak in faith. — This is a usual way of expressing the opposite,
        implying that his faith was peculiarly strong Faith is the substance of
        things hoped for, inasmuch as we believe that we shall in due time be
        put in possession of them. It is the evidence of things not seen, as
        thereby we are persuaded of the truth of all the unseen things declared
        in Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith thus makes future things present, and unseen things evident. He
        considered not his own body. — This is an example which ought ever to
        direct our faith. There are always obstacles and difficulties in the way
        of faith. We should give them no more weight than if they did not exist,
        reflecting that it is God who has to remove them. Nothing can be a
        difficulty in the way of the fulfillment of God’s own word. This ought
        to encourage us, not only with respect to ourselves, but with respect to
        the cause of God in the world. The government rests on the shoulders of
        Emmanuel. His own body now dead, etc. — Had Abraham looked on any
        natural means, he would have staggered; but he looked only to the power
        of Him who promised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but
        was strong in faith, giving glory to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        He staggered not. — This well expresses the meaning, the word signifying
        to doubt or hesitate. Dr. Macknight’s translation is bad, — ’He did not
        dispute.’ He might have hesitated or doubted, though he did not dispute.
        At the promise, or with respect to the promise, Abraham was not
        staggered by the difficulties or seeming impossibilities that stood in
        the way, but believed the promise of God, and trusted that it would be
        fulfilled. He would not listen to the suggestions of carnal reasonings;
        they were all set aside; he rested entirely on the fidelity of the
        promise. And all are bound to imitate this; for the Apostle says that
        the history of Abraham’s faith stands on record in Scripture, not for
        his sake only, but for us also, that we, after his example, may be
        encouraged to believe in Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the
        dead. But was strong in faith. — In the foregoing verse, Abraham is said
        not to have been weak in faith; here it is affirmed that he was strong
        in faith. This imports that there are degrees in faith, — a doctrine
        which some deny, but a doctrine which Scripture, in many places, most
        clearly establishes. Our Lord charges His disciples in general, and at
        another time Peter particularly, Matthew 6:30, 14:31, as having little
        faith: they had faith; but, unlike to Abraham’s, it was deficient in
        strength. Our Lord, too, speaks of the comparatively strong faith of the
        centurion, Matthew 8:10. He had not found so great faith in Israel. The
        Apostles, also, addressing Jesus, pray, ‘Lord, increase our faith,’ Luke
        17:5. In the same manner, the Apostle Paul speaks of the ‘measure of
        faith,’ Romans 12:3, importing that believers were endowed with
        different degrees of this gift. With such a profusion of instruction as
        the Scriptures afford on this point, it is strange that the love of
        theory should induce any to assert that faith is equal in all
        Christians. Giving glory to God. — How did he give glory to God? By
        believing that He would do what He promised, although nothing less than
        almighty power could effect what was promised. This is an important
        thought, that we glorify God by ascribing to Him His attributes, and
        believing that He will act according to them, notwithstanding many
        present appearances to the contrary. But how often is the opposite of
        this exemplified among many who profess to have the faith of Abraham,
        who, when unable to trace Divine wisdom, are apt to hesitate in yielding
        submission to Divine authority. Nothing, however, to countenance this is
        found in Scripture. On the contrary, no human action is more applauded
        than that of Abraham offering up Isaac in obedience to the command of
        God, in which he certainly could not then discover either the reason or
        the wisdom from which it proceeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without disregarding it for a moment, he yielded to the Divine
        authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was strong in faith, giving glory to God; that is, he gave full
        credit for the propriety of what was enjoined, and a ready
        acknowledgment of that implicit submission which on his part was due.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vers. 21, 22. — And being fully persuaded that what He had promised He
        was able also to perform. And therefore it was imputed to him for
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fully persuaded, or fully assured, being strongly convinced. — This is
        the explanation of the way in which he gave glory to God. We might
        suppose that every one who professes to believe in the attributes of
        God, would judge as Abraham did; yet experience shows the contrary. Even
        Christians do not act up to their principles on this point. The
        Israelites believed in God’s power and favor to them; but in time of
        trial they failed in giving Him glory by confiding in Him. In like
        manner, Christians, in their own individual cases, do not generally
        manifest that confidence in God which their principles would lead to
        expect. Also, that is, He was as able to perform as to promise. And
        therefore. — Because he believed God, notwithstanding all contrary
        appearances, his faith was imputed to him unto righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was
        imputed to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        This history of the way in which Abraham received righteousness is not
        recorded for his sake alone, or applicable to himself only, but is
        equally applicable to all believers. The Apostle here guards us against
        supposing that this method of justification was peculiar to Abraham, and
        teaches that it is the pattern of the justification of all who shall
        ever find acceptance with God. The first recorded testimony respecting
        the justification of any sinner, as has been already observed, is that
        of Abraham. Others had been justified from the fall down to his time;
        but it was reserved for him to possess the high privilege and
        distinction of being thus the first man singled out and constituted the
        progenitor of the Messiah. In him all the nations of the earth were to
        be blessed, and consequently he was to be the father of all believers,
        who are all the children of Christ, Hebrews 2:13, and the heir of that
        inheritance on earth that typified the inheritance in heaven, which
        belongs to Jesus Christ, who is ‘appointed heir of all things,’ with
        whom all believers are joint heirs. And in Abraham we see that, in the
        first declaration of the nature of justification, it is held out as
        being conferred by the imputation of righteousness through faith only.
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage, then, which refers to what is written, as well as those
        preceding it in this chapter, it must again be remarked, exhibit the
        character of the historical parts of Scripture as all divinely inspired,
        and all divinely arranged, in the wisdom of God, to apply to events the
        most important in the future dispensation. Every fact and every
        circumstance which they announce, as well as the whole narrative, was
        ordered and dictated by Him, to whom all His works are known from the
        beginning of the world, Acts 15:18.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe
        on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Righteousness shall be imputed to us, as well as to Abraham, if we have
        his faith. If we believe on Him that raised, etc. — Here God is
        characterized by the fact that He raised up Christ. This, then, is not a
        mere circumstance, but it is in this very character that our faith must
        view God.
      </p>
      <p>
        To believe for salvation, we must believe not in God absolutely, but in
        God as the raiser up of Jesus Christ This faith in God, as raising up
        our Lord, must also include a right view of Him. It must imply a belief
        of the Gospel, not only as to the fact of a resurrection, but also as to
        the person and work of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for
        our justification . Delivered — The Father gave over the Son to death,
        delivering Him into the hands of wicked men. Here we must look to a
        higher tribunal than that of Pilate, who delivered Him into the hands of
        the Jews. He was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
        of God. When Herod, Pilate, and the Gentiles, with the people of Israel,
        were gathered together against Him, it was to do whatsoever God’s word
        and counsel had determined before to be done Acts 4:28. The crucifixion
        of Christ being the greatest of all crimes, was hateful and highly
        provoking in the sight of God; yet it was the will of God that it should
        take place, in order to bring to pass the greatest good. God decreed
        this event; He willed that it should come to pass, and ordered
        circumstances, in His providence, in such a way as gave men an
        opportunity to carry into effect their wicked intentions. In their sin
        God had no part; and His determination that the deed should be done,
        formed no excuse for its perpetrators, nor did it in any degree
        extenuate their wickedness, which the Scriptures charge upon them in the
        fullest manner. ‘Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified
        and slain,’ Acts 2:23. This was an example of the same truth declared by
        Joseph to his brethren, ‘As for you, ye thought evil against me; but God
        meant it unto good,’ Genesis 1:20. For our offenses or on account of our
        offenses. — This shows the need of Christ’s death. It was not for an
        example, or for a witness merely, but for our offenses. Raised again for
        our justification. — That is, He was raised that He might enter the holy
        place not made with hands, and present His own blood, that we might be
        made righteous, through His death for us. As the death of Christ,
        according to the determinate counsel of a holy and righteous God, was a
        demonstration of the guilt of His people, so His resurrection was their
        acquittal from every charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is of importance to distinguish the persons to whom the Apostle
        refers in this and the following verses, where he says, if we believe,
        and speaks of righteousness being imputed to us, and of our offenses,
        and our justification. In the beginning of the chapter he uses the
        expression, ‘Abraham our father;’ but there he is introducing an
        objection that might be offered by the Jews, and appears to speak of
        Abraham as his own and their progenitor. But when, in the 12th verse, he
        says, ‘Our father Abraham,’ and, in the 16th, ‘the father of us all,’ he
        applied these expressions not to the Jews, or the natural descendants of
        Abraham, but to himself and those to whom he is writing, that is, to
        believers, to all of whom, whether Jews or Gentiles, in every age, as
        walking in the same steps of Abraham’s faith, they are applicable. And
        of the same persons he here speaks in the 24th and 25th verses, for
        whose offenses Jesus was delivered, and for whose justification He was
        raised again. They are those whom the Father had given Him, John 6:37,
        17:2; Hebrews 2:13; for the effect of His death was not to depend on the
        contingent will of man, but was fixed by the eternal purpose of God.
        They are those of whom it was promised to the Redeemer, that when He
        should make Himself an offering for sin, He should see of the travail of
        His soul and be satisfied, — those who are or shall be saved, and called
        with an holy calling, not according to their works, but according to
        God’s purpose and grace which was given them in Christ Jesus before the
        world began, 2 Timothy 1:9, — those who have the faith of God’s elect,
        who are brought by Him to the acknowledgment of the truth which is after
        godliness, who have the hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot
        lie, promised from eternity to their Head and Surety, Titus 1:1,2. No
        one, then, is entitled to consider himself among the number of those to
        whom the Apostle’s words are here applicable, unless he has obtained
        precious faith in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
        Yet the expression, our Savior, is often used by persons who reject
        God’s testimony concerning Him, and consequently have neither part nor
        lot in His salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having substituted Himself in the place of sinners, Jesus Christ
        suffered in His own person the punishment of sin, conformably to that
        declaration, ‘In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
        die.’ He came forth from among the dead, in testimony that the
        threatening of God was accomplished, and as a pledge of the acceptance
        of His sacrifice, and that by His obedience unto death Divine justice
        was satisfied, the law honored and magnified, and eternal life awarded
        to those for whom He died, whose sins He had borne in His own body on
        the tree, 1 Peter 2:24. He was quickened by the Spirit, 1 Peter 3:18; by
        whom He was also justified, 1 Timothy 3:16, from every charge that could
        be alleged against Him as the Surety and Covenant-head of those whose
        iniquities He bore. The justification, therefore, of His people, which
        includes not only the pardon of their sins, but also their title to the
        eternal inheritance, was begun in His death, and perfected by His
        resurrection. He wrought their justification by His death, but its
        efficacy depended on His resurrection. By His death He paid their debt;
        in His resurrection He received their acquaintance. He arose to assure
        to them their right to eternal life, by fully discovering and
        establishing it in His own person, for all who are the members of His
        body.
