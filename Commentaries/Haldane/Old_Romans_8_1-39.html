      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 8:1-39</p>
      <p>
        THIS chapter presents a glorious display of the power of Divine grace,
        and of the provision which God has made for the consolation of His
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Apostle had proved, in the sixth, that his previous doctrine
        gave no license to believers to continue in sin, he had still kept in
        view his main purpose of establishing their free justification. In the
        seventh he had prosecuted the same object, declaring that by their
        marriage with Christ they were delivered from the law as a covenant of
        life or death, while he vindicated its character, use, and authority. In
        this chapter, he continues the subject of justification, and resumes
        that of the believer’s assurance of his salvation, of which he had
        spoken in the fifth, establishing it on new grounds; and from the whole
        train of his argument from the commencement of the Epistle, he now draws
        the general conclusion, that to them who are in Christ Jesus there is no
        condemnation. While this could not have been accomplished by the law, he
        shows that it had been effected by the incarnation of the Son of God, by
        whom the law has been fulfilled for all who are one with Him as members
        of His body. Paul next points out the difference of character between
        those who, being in their natural state under the law and under sin, are
        carnally-minded; and those who, being renewed by grace, in whom the law
        has been fulfilled, are spiritually-minded. The condition of the former
        is death, that of the latter life and peace. Of these last he proceeds,
        through the remainder of the chapter, to assert the high privileges and
        absolute security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who are spiritually-minded have the Spirit of Christ, and possess
        spiritual life. Although their bodies must return to the dust, they
        shall be raised up again. They are led by the Spirit; they are the sons
        of God, and in His service are delivered from a spirit of bondage. They
        look to Him as their Father; are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus
        Christ. To encourage believers to sustain the sufferings to which, while
        in this world, they are exposed, the most varied and abundant
        consolations are exhibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their salvation is declared to have taken its rise in the eternal
        counsels of God, by whom, through all its steps, it is carried into
        effect. Their condemnation, then, is impossible; for who shall condemn
        those whom God justifieth, — for whom Christ died, and rose, and
        intercedes? The Apostle concludes by defying the whole universe to
        separate believers from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. In
        this manner he follows out, in this chapter, what had been his grand
        object through all the preceding part of the Epistle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
        Christ Jews who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore. — This is an inference from the general strain of the
        doctrine which the Apostle had been teaching in the preceding part of
        the Epistle; especially it follows from what he had asserted, in the
        sixth and seventh chapters, with respect to believers dying with Christ,
        and consequently being dead to sin and to the law. Now no condemnation.
        — This implies that there would have been condemnation to those to whom
        he wrote, had they remained under the law; but now, since they have died
        with Christ, and thereby given complete satisfaction to the law, both in
        its penalty and precept, it is not possible that by it they can be
        condemned. And, to mark the completeness of this exemption, he says,
        there is now no condemnation to them; the reason of which he fully
        explains in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th verses. This now, then, distinguishes
        two conditions of a man, namely, his condition under the law, and his
        condition under grace, — that is, his natural and his supernatural
        conditions. For by nature we are children of wrath, but now God has
        rendered us accepted in the Beloved. Being now in Christ, we are not
        under the curse of the law, because He has borne it for us In the moment
        in which we believed in Him, we were redeemed from its curse; we entered
        into another covenant, in which there is nothing but grace and pardon.
        That there is now no condemnation to them that are in Him is according
        to our Lord’s declaration, ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
        heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting
        life, and ‘shall not come into condemnation.’ It is often remarked that
        the Apostle does not say that there is in them which are in Christ Jesus
        neither matter of accusation nor cause of condemnation; and yet this is
        all included in what he does say. In themselves there is much indeed for
        both, but here they are viewed exclusively in Jesus Christ. Afterwards,
        in express terms, he denies that they can be either accused or condemned
        — which they might be, were there any ground for either. All that was
        commendable in them, which was sin, has been condemned in their Surety,
        as is shown in the 3rd verse. To them. — The Apostle, discoursing in the
        preceding chapter of the remainder of sin in believers, speaks of
        himself in his own person, in order to show that the highest advances in
        grace do not exempt from the internal warfare which he there describes.
        But in this verse he changes the number, and does not say, there is no
        condemnation to me, but to them, who are in Christ Jesus. This was
        proper, lest believers, who are often disposed to deprive themselves of
        those consolations which the Scriptures present, and prone either to
        despair or to presume on account of their own righteousness, should say
        that such a declaration was right and suitable in an Apostle, who
        enjoyed peculiar privileges, but it did not follow that they could say
        of themselves, ‘There is for us no condemnation.’ Paul therefore here
        changes the expression, and speaks in general terms, to show that he
        ascribes nothing peculiar to himself, but that he refers to the general
        condition of believers, in order that each of them might apply to
        himself the fruit of this consideration. In the seventh chapter he had
        spoken of himself to prove that the holiest among men have reason to
        humble themselves before God, and to acknowledge that, if God should
        view them in themselves, they would be found to be a body of death, —
        that is to say, guilty of eternal death. But here he does not speak in
        his own person, in order that we may not doubt that he refers to the
        condition of believers in general. Again, in the 4th verse, he speaks of
        the righteousness of the law being fulfilled in us; thus showing that
        the unspeakable blessing of deliverance from condemnation equally
        belongs to all the people of God. In the 2nd verse, for an obvious and
        important reason, as we shall presently see, he reverts again to the
        singular number, and says, ‘hath made me free.’ This manner of
        expressing himself ought to be particularly noted; for we are certain
        that, in the word of God, nothing of this kind occurs without a purpose.
        Which are in Christ Jesus. — To be in Christ Jesus is to be one with
        Him, as united to Him by faith. Those and those only who are the one
        with Him are the persons to whom there is no condemnation. All who are
        not in Christ Jesus are under the law and its curse. It is not here said
        that Christ is with His people, or at their right hand, but that they
        are in Him, in order that they may know that, being in Him, they have
        nothing to fear; for what evil can reach those who are one with the Son
        of God? This union is represented in Scripture by various terms and by
        many similitudes; its efficacy and power are shown, when it is said, ‘He
        that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit.’ It is in virtue of this union
        that the sufferings and obedience of Christ are imputed to His people,
        they being one with Him who fulfilled the law, and satisfied the justice
        of God. Their union with Him is the source of that spiritual life by
        which they are quickened together with Christ, and from which they
        derive their justification, their sanctification, and consolation. ‘It
        is impossible,’ Luther remarks, ‘for a man to be a Christian without
        having Christ, and if he has Christ, he has at the same time all that is
        in Christ. What gives peace to the conscience is, that by faith our sins
        are no more ours, but Christ’s, upon whom God hath laid them all; and
        that, on the other hand, all Christ’s righteousness is ours, to whom God
        hath given it. Christ lays His hand upon us, and we are healed. He casts
        His mantle upon us, and we are clothed; for He is the glorious Savior,
        blessed for ever.’ This union was typified under the law in the person
        of the high priest, who carried on his breast the twelve stones, on
        which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
        Israel; so that, when he appeared before God, all the people appeared in
        him, thus showing that all believers are before God in Jesus Christ,
        their great High Priest. They are all delivered from condemnation, as
        being one body with Christ. As the debts of a wife must be discharged by
        her husband, and as, by her marriage, all her previous obligations are
        at once transferred to him, so the believer, being married to Christ, is
        no longer exposed to the curse of the law. All its demands have been met
        and satisfied by His covenant Head, with whom, as the wife is one with
        the husband, so he is one.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is by the human nature of Jesus Christ that we enjoy union with His
        Divine nature, and that He is Emmanuel, God with us. His humanity is the
        medium by which His divinity communicates itself with all its graces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the former dispensation, God communicated with His people through
        the ark of the covenant, which was a type of the human nature of Jesus
        Christ, in order to show us that by it we have union with the whole of
        His person. And by union with the person of Jesus Christ we obtain
        communion with the Father. ‘At that day ye shall know that I am in My
        Father, and you in Me, and I in you.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not by nature that we enjoy this union, since by nature we are
        ‘children of wrath’ and ‘without Christ.’ The means by which we are
        united to Christ are on His part by His Spirit, and on our part by
        faith. He communicates His Spirit to us, which is as the soul that
        unites all the members of the body with the head, so that ‘he who is
        joined unto the Lord is one Spirit.’ On our part we receive Jesus Christ
        by faith produced in us by His Spirit, in order that we may reciprocally
        receive Him in our hearts. He dwells in our hearts by faith; and thus we
        learn what is meant when it is said we are justified by faith, not as
        being a work, or anything meritorious, but as the medium through which
        His righteousness, and all the graces and blessings that are in Jesus
        Christ, are communicated to our souls. ‘Faith,’ says Luther, ‘unites the
        soul with Christ as a spouse with her husband. Everything which Christ
        has, becomes the property of the believing soul: everything which the
        soul has, becomes the property of Christ. Christ possesses all blessings
        and eternal life: they are thenceforward the property of the soul. The
        soul has all its iniquities and sins: they become thenceforward the
        property of Christ. It is then that a blessed exchange commences: Christ
        who is both God and man, Christ who has never sinned, and whose holiness
        is perfect, Christ the Almighty and Eternal, taking to Himself, by His
        nuptial ring of faith, all the sins of the believer, those sins are lost
        and abolished in Him; for no sins dwell before His infinite
        righteousness. Thus, by faith, the believer’s soul is delivered from
        sins, and clothed with the eternal righteousness of her bridegroom
        Christ. O happy union! The rich, the noble, the holy Bridegroom takes in
        marriage his poor, guilty, and despised spouse, delivers her from every
        evil, and enriches her with the most precious blessings. Christ, a King
        and a Priest, shares this honor and glory with all Christians. The
        Christian is a king, and consequently possesses all things; he is a
        priest, and consequently possesses God; and it is faith, not works,
        which brings him all this honor. A Christian is free from all things,
        above all things, faith giving him richly all things.’
      </p>
      <p>
        On account of this union, all believers bear the name of Christ, being
        that of their Head. ‘For as the body is one, and hath many members, and
        all the members of that one body being many, are one body; so also is
        Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body,’ 1
        Corinthians 12:13. ‘We are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
        bones,’ Ephesians 5:30. And in this Epistle to the Ephesians, the
        Apostle denominates the Church not only the body of Jesus Christ, but
        even His fullness. God ‘gave Him to be the Head over all things to the
        Church, which is His body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all,’
        Ephesians 1:22. He thus shows that this union with Jesus Christ is such
        that He who filleth all things would consider Himself without His people
        to be imperfect and incomplete. Who walk not after (according to) the
        flesh, but after (according to) the Spirit. — These words not being
        found in all the manuscripts, are considered by some as spurious. But
        they connect perfectly well with the preceding clause of the verse, as
        characterizing those who are in Christ Jesus. In no respect, however, do
        they assign the cause of exemption from condemnation to them who are in
        Christ. The Apostle does not say, because they do not walk, but who
        walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. There is an essential
        difference between asserting the character of those who are freed from
        condemnation, and declaring the cause of their being delivered from it.
        These words refer to the proof of our justification, which proceeds from
        the efficacy of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, who applies the merit of
        the blood of Jesus, and imparts a new and eternal life, opposed to sin
        and corruption, which the Scriptures call death in sin, for the minding
        of the flesh is death, but the minding of the Spirit is life. In this
        way, then, we may be assured that we are in Christ Jesus, and that there
        is no condemnation to us, if we experience the effects of His Spirit in
        our hearts causing us to walk in holiness. For the life which Jesus
        Christ has merited for us on the cross, consists not only in the
        remission of sins, which is a removal of what is evil, but also in the
        communication of what is good, namely, in our bearing the image of God.
        The same words as in the clause before us occur again in verse 4th, in
        which their genuineness is not disputed, where their full import shall
        be considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
        free from the law of sin and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse, as is evident by the particle for , is connected with the
        preceding. It connects, however, with the first part of that verse,
        where the great truth of which it is explanatory is announced, assigning
        the reason why there is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus;
        which is continued to the middle of the 4th verse, in the latter part of
        which the last clause of the first is repeated. On the supposition of
        that clause being genuine, the Apostle follows here the same method as
        in the second chapter of this Epistle, where the 14th verse connects
        with the first part of the 12th. Many, by the phrase ‘law of the Spirit
        of life,’ understand the commanding influence of the Holy Spirit in the
        sanctification of the believers to be intended, and by ‘the law of sin
        and death,’ the corrupt principle, or power of sin in them, as in
        chapter 7:23 and 25. But these explanations do not suit the context. The
        main proposition contained in the preceding verse is, that to them who
        are in Christ Jesus there is no condemnation. But why is there no
        condemnation?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it because they are sanctified? No; but because by their union with
        Christ they have been freed from the law and its curse, as the Apostle
        had shown in the preceding chapter, verse 4. Besides, it is not true
        that believers are delivered from the law of sin that is in them as
        respects their sanctification, which would contradict what Paul had just
        before said of the Christian’s internal warfare with sin, as exhibited
        in his own experience, to which deliverance he looked forward, but which
        he had not yet obtained. It is further to be observed, that the above
        explanations do not accord with the two following verses, which point
        out the ground of that freedom from condemnation which is here asserted,
        being explanatory of the verse before us, declaring that sin has been
        punished in Christ, and that the righteousness which the law demands has
        been fulfilled by Him in those who belong to Him. Law of the Spirit. —
        Various significations belong to the term law, according to the
        connection in which it stands, and to which it is applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the conclusion of the preceding chapter, and in the verse before us,
        where it occurs twice, it is employed in three different senses. In the
        first of these it is denominated the ‘law of sin,’ namely, the strength
        of corruption acting with the force of a law. In the end of the verse
        before us, where the term ‘death’ is added to that of sin, it imports
        the moral law, the transgression of which is sin, and the consequence
        death, and is employed in the same sense in the two following verses. To
        the law of the spirit of life belongs a different meaning, signifying
        the power of the Holy Spirit, by which He unites the soul to Christ, in
        whose righteousness as being thus one with Him, it therefore partakes,
        and is consequently justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law is the Gospel, whereof the Holy Ghost is the author, being the
        authoritative rule and the instrument by which He acts in the plan of
        salvation. It is the medium through which He promulgates Divine
        testimony, and His commands to receive that testimony, and exerts His
        power to produce this effect; by which, also, He quickens and enlightens
        those in whom He dwells, convinces them of their sin and of the
        righteousness of Christ, and testifies of the almighty Savior, whom God
        hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood. The
        Gospel may thus be properly denominated the law , or power of the Holy
        Spirit, because, as a law has authority and binds to obedience, so the
        Gospel bears the stamp of Divine authority to which, in all that it
        reveals, we are bound to ‘submit,’ ch. 10:3. It requires the obedience
        of faith, and for this end is to be made known to all nations, ch. 1:5,
        16:26; and when men refuse this submission, it is said that they have
        not ‘obeyed the Gospel,’ ch. 10:16. Although, therefore, the Gospel is
        proclaimed as a grace, it is a grace accompanied with authority, which
        God commands to be received. Accordingly it is expressly called a ‘law,’
        Isaiah 2:3; Micah 4:2. ‘Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word
        of the Lord from Jerusalem.’ In the Book of Psalm it is again and again
        called ‘ the law;’ and in <19B002> Psalm 110:2, referring to the power
        exerted by its means, it is said, ‘The Lord shall send the rod of thy
        strength out of Zion,’ that is, the Gospel. ‘Rule Thou in the midst of
        Thine enemies,’ namely, by Thine almighty power. The Gospel, then, is
        the law of the Spirit by which He rules, and the rod of His strength, or
        His power, by which He effects our salvation, just as, in chapter 1:16,
        it is denominated ‘the power of God unto salvation.’ The Gospel is
        itself called ‘the Spirit,’ as being ministered by the Holy Spirit, 2
        Corinthians 3:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel is the law of the Spirit of life, the ministration of which,
        being committed to the Apostles, ‘giveth life,’ in opposition to the
        ‘letter,’ or old covenant that killeth, 2 Corinthians 3:6. ‘It is the
        Spirit that quickeneth,’ John 6:63, as it is said, ‘I shall put My
        Spirit in you, and ye shall live,’ Ezekiel 37:14. In the First Epistle
        to the Corinthians 15:45, the Apostle speaks of two sources of life. He
        says, ‘The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made
        a quickening spirit.’ By the living soul is meant the principle of
        natural life which we derive from Adam by natural generation. The
        quickening spirit refers to the heavenly and supernatural life
        communicated by the Holy Spirit from Jesus Christ. The reason of the
        comparison is, that as Adam, receiving a living soul, his body was made
        alive; in like manner, believers, receiving in their souls the Spirit of
        Christ, receive a new life. It is not meant that the Spirit of Christ is
        not also the author of natural life, Job 33:4. Jesus Christ is the life
        itself, and the source of life to all creatures. But here the life
        referred to is that life which we receive through the Gospel, as the law
        or power of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, which the Apostle calls
        ‘the life of God,’ Ephesians 4:18.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus . — Jesus Christ is set
        before us in two aspects, namely, as God, and as Mediator. As God, the
        Spirit of life resides essentially in Him; but as Mediator, and having
        in that character satisfied the justice of God by His death, the Spirit
        of life has been given to Him to be communicated to all who are one with
        Him. On this account the Spirit was not given in His fullness, John
        7:39, till Jesus Christ as Mediator had entered into heaven, to appear
        in the heavenly sanctuary with His blood, when the Father, solemnly
        receiving His satisfaction, gave this testimony of His acceptance, in
        pouring out the abundance of the Spirit on His people. Jesus Christ
        accordingly says, ‘It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go
        not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will
        send Him unto you,’ John 16:7. And the Apostle declares that ‘God hath
        blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ,’
        Ephesians 1:3. He says, ‘spiritual blessings,’ because he speaks of the
        graces of the Holy Spirit. He says, ‘in Christ,’ because it is through
        the Mediator, and in His communion, that our spiritual life and those
        graces are bestowed on us. He adds, ‘in heavenly places,’ because, as
        anciently the high priest entered the sanctuary with the blood of the
        sacrifice, in order that God, in accepting that blood, might bestow His
        blessing on the people; in like manner, Jesus Christ, our great High
        Priest, has entered the heavenly sanctuary, that, being accepted, He
        should, as Mediator, and so receiving the Holy Spirit, be the source of
        life, even of that spiritual and eternal life to which He rose from the
        dead, and of all grace, to communicate it to His Church. This is what
        His forerunner John teaches when he says that ‘God giveth not the Spirit
        by measure unto Him,’ and is the reason why it is said that He was ‘full
        of grace and truth,’ and that ‘of His fullness we have all received, and
        grace for grace.’ The Apostle John, too, speaks of the anointing which
        believers have received from Jesus Christ; for as the oil was poured on
        the head of the high priest, and ran down to the skirts of his garments,
        in like manner Jesus Christ has been anointed with the Holy Spirit, as
        He says, ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed
        Me;’ and this anointing was to be poured out on all His body, which is
        the Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Spirit of life, then, is in Jesus Christ, not only as God, but
        also as Mediator, is a ground of the most unspeakable consolation. It
        might be in Him as God, without being communicated to men; but, as the
        Head of His people, it must be diffused through them as His members, who
        are thus complete in Him. Dost thou feel in thyself the sentence of
        death? — listen, then, to the testimony of the Scriptures concerning
        Him. ‘This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life; and
        this life is in His Son.’ ‘I am come that they might have life.’ He that
        believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever
        liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die.’ ‘Because I live, ye shall
        live also.’ ‘I am that bread of life; he that eateth of this bread shall
        never die.’ ‘I am the resurrection and the life.’ ‘This life, then, is
        in Jesus Christ, and is communicated to believers by the Holy Spirit, by
        whom they are united to Christ, and from whom it is derived to all who
        through the law of the Spirit of life are in Him. It is on this account
        that, in the passage above quoted, Corinthians 15:45, Jesus Christ, as
        Mediator, is said to be made a quickening spirit. In obtaining this
        life, the believer receives his justification, the opposite of
        condemnation, which without this life cannot subsist, and from which it
        cannot be separated. Law of sin and death. — In the preceding chapter,
        verses 23 and 25, ‘the law of sin,’ which the Apostle says he served
        with the flesh, signifies, as has been observed, the powerful corrupt
        principle in the heart, operating with the force of a law. But in the
        former part of the same chapter, the word ‘law’ is employed to denote
        the moral law. It is there spoken of as the law of God, which, though
        holy, and just, and good, is to fallen man the occasion both of sin and
        death; and, accordingly, in the point of view in which the Apostle is
        here regarding it, it is called ‘the law of sin and death.’ It may be
        called the law of sin, since without it sin could not exist; for ‘sin is
        the transgression of the law,’ 1 John 3:4; but ‘where no law is, there
        is no transgression,’ and ‘sin is not imputed when there is no law,’
        Romans 5:13. ‘The motions of sin are by the law,’ Romans 7:5; and ‘the
        strength of sin is the law,’ 1 Corinthians 15:56. ‘By the commandment
        sin becomes exceeding sinful,’ Romans 7:13. ‘The law entered that the
        offense might abound,’ Romans 5:20. As, therefore, sin could have no
        existence but by the law, and as the law is the strength of sin, and
        makes it to abound, the law may, as here, be properly denominated ‘the
        law of sin.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The holy law may also be called the law of death. It threatens with
        death in case of disobedience, and on account of transgression adjudges
        to death. ‘The commandment,’ says the Apostle, ‘which was ordained to
        life, I found to be unto death.’ It brings the sinner under the penalty
        of death. ‘In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’ The
        law ‘killeth;’ and the ministration of the law, written and engraved on
        stones, was death, 2 Corinthians 3:6,7. By the law ‘death reigned from
        Adam to Moses,’ Romans 5:14; and the wages of sin, which is the
        transgression of the law, is death. Since, then, the law of God, which,
        though it commands holiness, gives the knowledge of sin, and the breach
        of it is death, and since, without the law, there could neither be sin
        nor death, it may, without arguing the smallest disrespect or
        disparagement to the holy law, be called the law of sin and death. That
        it is so denominated in the verse before us, appears from the repetition
        of the term law in the beginning of the following verse, evidently in
        connection with that in the end of this verse, where the reference is
        clearly to the moral law, namely, the law which had been spoken of from
        the 4th to the 13th verse of the foregoing chapter, which the Apostle
        had there shown, as he asserts in verse 3 of this chapter, could not set
        free from sin and death. Besides, that by the law of sin and death is
        here meant the moral law, appears unquestionable, when it is considered
        that if the same meaning be attached to it as belongs to the phrase ‘the
        law of sin’ in the conclusion of the preceding chapter, the Apostle must
        be held to have contradicted himself. For in that case he bitterly
        laments his being under the power of the law of sin, and speaks only of
        his hope of future deliverance; and here, in the same breath, he
        unqualifiedly asserts his freedom from it. Notwithstanding, then, the
        similarity of these two expressions, and their juxtaposition, it is
        impossible, without charging a contradiction on the Apostle, to assert
        that he attached the same meaning in both places to the word law, which
        in different connections is capable of significations quite distinct.
        Hath made me free. — The reason why there is no condemnation to them
        which are in Christ Jesus is, that being in Him they have been made free
        from the law of sin and death, all its requirements having been
        fulfilled by Him in them, as is affirmed in verse 4. This freedom is
        likewise declared in 2 Corinthians 3:17, in which passage it is said,
        ‘Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.’ ‘If the Son
        therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.’ Me free. — Here
        it is to be observed that the Apostle, instead of speaking generally of
        believers, as he does in the first and fourth verses, saying ‘them’ and
        ‘us,’ changes, as has been above remarked, the mode of expression, and
        refers to himself personally — ’hath made me free.’ A very striking
        contrast is thus pointed out between his declaration in the 24th verse
        of the preceding chapter, and that contained in the verse before us.
        There, he is speaking of the power of sin, which operates in believers
        as long as they are in this world. Here, in reference to condemnation,
        he is speaking of the guilt of sin, from which they are perfectly freed
        the moment they are united to the Savior. In the former case, therefore,
        where he speaks respecting sanctification, he refers in verse 24th to
        his deliverance as future, and exclaims, ‘Who shall deliver me?’ In
        reference to the latter, in which he is treating of justification, he
        speaks of his deliverance as already obtained, and affirms, He ‘hath
        made me free.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The following explanation of the verse before us is given in the
        Westminster Confession of Faith. ‘Albeit the Apostle himself (brought in
        here for example’s cause), and all other true believers in Christ, be by
        nature under the law of sin and death, or under the covenant of works
        (called the law of sin and death, because it bindeth sin and death upon
        us, till Christ set us free); yet the law of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,
        or the covenant of grace (so called because it doth enable and quicken a
        man to a spiritual life through Christ), doth set the Apostle, and all
        true believers, free from the covenant of works, or the law of sin and
        death; so that every man may say with him, ‘The law of the Spirit of
        life,’ or the covenant of grace, hath made me free from the law of sin
        and death, or covenant of works,’ ed. 1773, p. 434.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every believer should take to himself all the consolation which this
        verse contains, and with Paul he may with confidence say, ‘The law of
        the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin
        and death.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, however, will say, We should be happy indeed if we could, with
        Paul, adopt this language; but what assurance can we have of being free
        from condemnation, and of being in Christ Jesus, since the flesh is so
        strong in us and the spirit so weak, — since we are still prone to so
        many sins, and subject to so many defects? Assuredly if a man is
        satisfied in sinning and following carnal desires, and is not desirous
        to turn from these ways, he has no ground to conclude that he is freed
        from condemnation, for such is not the state of any believer. But if, on
        the other hand, he groans on account of his sins, crying out with the
        Apostle, ‘O wretched man that I am;’ if they displease him, if he have a
        godly sadness on account of having committed them, and earnestly prays
        to God to be delivered from them, he may be assured of his salvation.
        For the Christian is not one who is without sin and evil inclinations,
        as is abundantly shown in the preceding chapters; but one who resists
        and combats against them, and returns to God by repentance. His groans
        on account of his sins, and his meditating on the word of God, — his
        earnest endeavors to be holy and to grow in grace, although not with all
        the success he desires, — are proofs of his regeneration. For if he were
        dead in his sins, he would not be affected on account of them, nor would
        he resist them. And whoever resists the flesh by the Spirit of God, will
        in the end obtain the victory, for the Holy Spirit in us is greater in
        goodness and power than all that is against us, — Satan, and the world,
        and the flesh. All this should inspire the believer with courage to
        fight the good fight of faith, and to follow the movements of the
        blessed Spirit, and the Lord will say to his soul, ‘I am thy salvation,’
        Psalm 35:3; ‘My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made
        perfect in weakness,’ 2 Corinthians 12:9; and he, on the other hand, may
        say with confidence, ‘O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art
        my Lord,’ Psalm 16:2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
        flesh, and sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
        sin condemned sin in the flesh: This verse confirms the interpretation
        that has been given of the preceding, with which it stands connected. It
        is introduced to explain what is said in the two preceding verses. Both
        this and the following verse are illustrations of that great truth, that
        to the believer in Christ there is no condemnation There are here three
        principal considerations: namely, the misery of our natural condition;
        the mercy of God in the incarnation of His Son; and the effect of
        sending Him into the world, which is our redemption. Under these three
        heads, the Apostle removes the difficulties that might present
        themselves from the supposition that, on account of some imperfection in
        the law, it could not justify. In answer to this, it is here shown that
        the imperfection is not in the law, but in us. The law could justify
        those who fulfilled it, as it is said, ‘The man that doeth them shall
        live in them; ‘but the corruption of human nature renders this
        impossible. And as it might be objected that the law, which subjects
        every transgressor to death, is violated by the freedom from it which we
        obtain by the death of Jesus Christ, the Apostle shows that the
        punishment it demands was inflicted upon Him. Hence the first
        proposition, that there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ
        Jesus, is established; and in the following verse it is added, that the
        law, which we were required to fulfill, has by Him been fulfilled in us.
        In this view, the justice of God, which naturally terrifies man,
        inspires us with confidence. For if God is just, will He exact double
        payment and satisfaction? Will He condemn those for whom the Surety has
        borne the condemnation? No; ‘He is faithful and just to forgive us our
        sins,’ for ‘the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all
        sin.’ For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
        Flesh. — The law here meant is the same as that spoken of in the end of
        the preceding verse, namely, the moral law, under which our first
        parents in the state of innocence were placed, and which was afterwards
        promulgated by the ministry of Moses. This law was ordained to life, ch.
        7:10, — that is, to justify man, if he had remained in innocence; but by
        his sinning it condemns him, as the Apostle adds, ‘I found it to be unto
        death;’ so that the law, the breach of which constitutes sin, and which
        on account of this awards death, is now unable to justify, but powerful
        to condemn.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse proves that the method which God takes to justify the sinner
        is entirely consistent with law and justice. Firsts the Apostle shows
        the necessity of this method. For what the law could not do, in that it
        was weak through the flesh. — What is it that the law could not do? It
        could not justify. Mr. Frazer, however, says that the reason of this
        alleged weakness of the law forbids this interpretation. ‘That,’ says
        he, is not the reason why the law cannot justify.’ But surely it is the
        very reason why the law cannot justify. Were it not for the weakness of
        the flesh, or the corruption and sinfulness of man, the law could
        justify. ‘But,’ he continues, ‘to turn the disability of the law to
        justify the sinner upon the corruption of his nature, as the text would
        do, according to the interpretation I am considering, would imply
        something by no means consistent with the Apostle’s clear doctrine,
        viz., that after a person had transgressed he might be justified, even
        by the law, for returning to his duty, and for his subsequent
        righteousness, if the weakness and poverty of his nature, called the
        flesh, did not disable him from doing his duty; which how contrary to
        Scripture doctrine I need not stay to prove, the thing is so clear.’ But
        did this acute and worthy author overlook what our Lord says to the rich
        young man, ‘If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments’? In
        fact, however, the commandments could not be kept unless every
        commandment that respects man is obeyed; therefore the commandment in
        the garden of Eden is included; because, being guilty of breaking it, no
        man can be said to have obeyed God as he ought. The weakness of the
        flesh includes everything that befell us by the fall. Every man is as
        truly accountable for that first sin of Adam as he is for his own
        personal sins; and therefore, as long as he is under condemnation for
        that sin, he cannot be said to keep the commandments. ‘By the law is the
        knowledge of sin.’ It is the test of men being sinners. If it were kept,
        this would prove that we were not sinners. It entered, that the offense
        might abound; and the Lord applied this test for the young man’s
        conviction. Yet what he said was truth: if the young man had kept the
        commandments, he would, as a holy creature, have enjoyed life; he would
        not have been a sinner. But he was so ignorant as to say he had kept
        them all. The Lord replied, ‘One thing thou lackest,’ and said, ‘Follow
        Me.’ If he had really kept the commandments, he would have had no need
        of a Savior; but he was a sinner, and Christ informed him of the only
        way of salvation. The law could not give life to one by whom it was
        forfeited.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weakness of the law through the flesh Mr. Stuart explains thus:
        ‘Because, through the strength of our carnal inclinations and desires,
        it was unable to regulate our lives, so that we should be perfect or
        actually free from sin.’ But as Christ is said to do what the law
        through this weakness could not do, this interpretation supposes that
        Christ has enabled us to regulate our lives so as to be entirely free
        from sin. Nothing can be more obvious than that the weakness of the law
        through the flesh is its inability to justify, as it would have done,
        had not sin entered. The weakness of the law for justification is no
        disparagement to it. It was never designed to save a sinner. How could
        it be supposed that a creature who had apostatized, and was a rebel
        against God, could re-establish himself in the Divine favor? Yet such
        re-establishment, in order to the enjoyment of the favor of God, was
        necessary. A creature in such circumstances could only be re-established
        by God Himself, and that by an act of free and sovereign mercy,
        compatible with His Justice and truth, as well as with the essential
        glory of His character. It is also impossible that mercy could be
        extended in any other way than that which the Gospel reveals. How could
        the justice of God be satisfied but by an atonement of infinite value,
        to meet the infinite evil of sin? And how could such an atonement be
        made for man but by one who was at the same time both God and man — the
        infinite God manifest in human nature? This was the remedy which God
        provided; therefore it was the best remedy. It was the highest possible
        remedy; therefore there could be no other. It would be inconsistent with
        infinite wisdom to employ means greater than are necessary in order to
        accomplish an end. The law was strong to perform its own office, — that
        is, to justify all by whom it was perfectly obeyed. Its weakness was
        through the flesh, — that is, the guilt and corruption of our nature.
        The weakness is not in the law; it is in man. God sending His own Son. —
        God sent His Son to do that which the law could not do. He sent Him in
        consequence of His great love to His people, 1 John 4:9; and as the
        accomplishment of His Divine purpose, Acts 4:28. The object, then, of
        Christ’s mission was not merely that of a messenger or witness; it was
        to effect the salvation of guilty sinners in the way of righteousness.
        He did what the law could not do. The law could justify those only by
        whom it was observed; but it could not justify or save those who should
        violate even the least of its commands. But Christ Jesus both justifies
        and saves the ungodly. His own son — Christ was God’s own Son in the
        literal sense. It is on this supposition only that the sending of Him is
        a manifestation of infinite love to men. There is no more appearance of
        any figurative meaning in the use of this appellation, when ascribed to
        Jesus Christ, than there is when Isaac is called the son of Abraham. He
        is here emphatically called not only the Son of God, but the Son of
        Himself, or His own Son — His very Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether Christ’s sonship is a relation in Godhead, or a figurative
        sonship, has been much disputed. Many who hold the Godhead of Christ
        explain the passages that assert His sonship as referring to His
        incarnation. That the phrase Son of God imports the Divine nature of
        Jesus Christ, there can be no doubt, John 5:18 (see pp. 21-25); and that
        it relates not merely to His incarnation, but to His eternal relation to
        the Father, appears the obvious testimony of Scripture. No reasoning
        from the import of the relation among men can form a valid objection to
        this view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam is called the son of God because he was created by the immediate
        exercise of Divine power. The angels are called the sons of God on
        account of their creation, and the greatness of their condition;
        believers, by the right of their adoption and regeneration; but none
        except the Messiah is called the Only-begotten of the Father. These
        words, ‘I have begotten Thee,’ are indeed applied to Jesus Christ, Acts
        13:33, not with respect to His eternal generation, but to His
        resurrection and establishment in the priesthood; and import that He was
        thus made known to be the Son of God, as it is said, Romans 1:4, that He
        was declared to be the Son of God with power, by His resurrection from
        the dead. The exaltation of Jesus Christ, whether in His office of
        Mediator or in sovereign glory, is the authoritative declaration of the
        Father that He was His Son, His only-begotten Son; and this is signified
        in the second Psalm. There, the elevation of Jesus Christ to the
        sovereign dominion of the world is spoken of. ‘I have set My King upon
        My holy hill of Zion.’ It is as to the act of His elevation that this
        declaration is made. ‘I will declare the decree: The Lord hath said unto
        Me, Thou art My Son; this day have I begotten Thee.’ Thus, according to
        the usual style of Scripture, things are said to be done when they are
        declared or publicly manifested. When it is said, ‘This day have I
        begotten Thee, the eternal dignity of the Savior, which had been before
        concealed, was brought to light and fully discovered. In the likeness of
        sinful flesh. — Jesus Christ was sent, not in the likeness of flesh, but
        in the flesh. He was sent, however, not in sinful flesh, but in the
        likeness of sinful flesh. Nothing can more clearly prove that the Lord
        Jesus Christ, though He assumed our nature, took it without taint of sin
        or corruption. To His perfect holiness the Scriptures bear the fullest
        testimony. ‘He knew no sin.’ ‘The prince of this world cometh and hath
        nothing in Me.’ He was ‘holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
        sinners.’
      </p>
      <p>
        His absolute freedom from sin was indispensable. As God becoming
        manifest in the flesh, He could not unite Himself to a nature tainted
        with the smallest impurity. He was conceived by the power of the Holy
        Ghost, and did not spring from Adam by ordinary generation; and, not
        belonging to his covenant, had no part in his sin. His freedom from sin,
        original and actual, was necessary, in order that He should be offered
        as ‘a Lamb without blemish and without spot,’ so that He might be the
        truth of His types, the legal sacrifices, which it was expressly
        provided should be free from all blemish; thus distinctly indicating
        this transcendent characteristic of Him who was to be the one great
        sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the flesh of Jesus Christ was the likeness of sinful flesh, there
        must be a difference between the appearance of sinful flesh and our
        nature, or flesh in its original state when Adam was created. Christ,
        then, was not made in the likeness of the flesh of man before sin
        entered the world, but in the likeness of his fallen flesh. Though He
        had no corruption in His nature, yet He had all the sinless infirmities
        of our flesh. The person of man, in his present state, may be greatly
        different from what it was when Adam came from the hand of his Creator.
        Our bodies, as they are at present, are called ‘the bodies of our
        humiliation,’ Philippians 3:21. Jesus Christ was made in man’s present
        likeness. Tradition speaks of the beauty of His person when on earth;
        but this is the wisdom of man. The Scriptures nowhere represent Christ
        in His -manhood as distinguished by personal beauty. No observation of
        this kind, proceeding either from His friends or enemies, is recorded in
        the Gospels. And for sin. — The reason of the mission of our Lord Jesus
        Christ into the world — of His incarnation and humiliation — was the
        abolition of sin, its destruction, both as to its guilt and power. The
        same expression occurs, 1 Peter 3:18, ‘Christ also hath once suffered
        for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God.’ It is
        sin that is the cause of separation from God; and by its removal
        reconciliation is made, and peace restored. Condemned sin in the flesh.
        — Here, by the flesh is meant, not the body of Jesus Christ only, but
        His human nature. In this sense the word flesh is used where it is said,
        ‘the Word was made flesh,’ — that is to say, was made man, and took our
        nature, composed of body and soul. The nature and the person who
        suffered must also be distinguished. Respecting the person, it is Jesus
        Christ, God and man; as to the nature in which He suffered, it is in the
        flesh. Of the person we can say that it is God, as the Apostle says that
        God hath purchased the Church with His own blood, and consequently that
        His suffering was of infinite value, since it is that of an infinite
        person; and this is the more evident, since Jesus Christ is Mediator in
        both His natures, and not in His human nature only. For if this were so,
        His suffering would be finite, since His human nature, in which alone He
        could suffer, by which He offered His sacrifice, was in itself only
        finite; and if He had been Mediator only as to His human nature — which,
        however, could not be, as He represents both God and man — He could not
        have been the Mediator of the Old Testament, when He had not taken the
        human nature. And as it is necessary that, in regard to His person, we
        should consider Jesus Christ suffering, it is also necessary that we
        consider that it was in the flesh that He suffered, — that is to say, in
        our nature, which He took and joined personally to the Divine nature. In
        this we may admire the wisdom of God, who caused sin to be punished and
        destroyed in the human nature, in which it had been committed. Condemned
        sin. — Condemnation is here taken for the punishment of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        God punished sin in Christ’s human nature. This is the method that God
        took to justify sinners. It was God who, by His determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge, Acts 2:23, punished sin by inflicting those sufferings on
        Christ of which men were only the instruments. Sin had corrupted the
        flesh of man, and in that very flesh it was condemned. The guilt and
        punishment of sin are eminently seen in the death of Christ. Nowhere
        else is sin so completely judged and condemned. Not even in hell are its
        guilt and demerits so fully manifested. What must be its demerit, if it
        could be atoned for by nothing but the death of the Son of God? and what
        can afford clearer evidence of God’s determination to punish sin to the
        utmost extent of its demerit, than that He thus punished it even when
        laid on the head of His only-begotten Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all this we see the Father assuming the place of judge against His
        Son, in order to become the Father of those who were His enemies. The
        Father condemns the Son of His love, that He may absolve the children of
        wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we inquire into the cause that moved God to save us by such means,
        what can we say, but that it proceeded from His incomprehensible wisdom,
        His ineffable goodness, and the unfathomable depth of His mercies? For
        what was there in man that could induce the Creator to act in this
        manner, since He saw nothing in him, after his rebellion by sin, but
        what was hateful and offensive? And what was it but His love that
        passeth knowledge which induced the only-begotten Son of God to take the
        form of a servant, to humble Himself even to the death of the cross, and
        to submit to be despised and rejected of men? These are the things into
        which the angels desire to look.
      </p>
      <p>
        But besides the love of God, we see the wonderful display of His justice
        in condemning sin in His Son, rather than allowing it to go unpunished.
        In this assuredly the work of redemption surpasses that of creation. In
        creation God had made nothing that was not good, and nothing especially
        on which He could exercise the rigor of His justice; but here He
        punishes our sins to the utmost in Jesus Christ. It may be inquired if,
        when God condemned sin in His Son, we are to understand this of God the
        Father, so as to exclude the Son; or if we can say that God the Son also
        condemned sin in Himself. This can undoubtedly be affirmed; for in the
        Father and the Son there is only one will and one regard for justice; so
        that, as it was the will of the Father to require satisfaction for sin
        from the Son, it was also the will of the Son to humble Himself, and to
        condemn sin in Himself. We must, however, distinguish between Jesus
        Christ considered as God, and as our Surety and Mediator. As God, He
        condemns and punishes sin; as Mediator, He is Himself condemned and
        punished for sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        When sin was condemned or punished in the Son of God, to suppose that He
        felt nothing more than bodily pain, would be to conclude that He had
        less confidence in God than many martyrs who have gone to death
        cheerfully, and without fear. The extremity of the pain He suffered when
        He said in the garden, ‘My soul is sorrowful even unto death,’ was the
        sentiment of the wrath of God against sin, from which martyrs felt
        themselves delivered. For the curse of the law is principally spiritual,
        namely, privation of communion with God in the sense of His wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, therefore, was made a curse for us, as the Apostle says,
        Galatians 3:13, proving it by the declaration, ‘Cursed is every one that
        hangeth on a tree.’ For this punishment of the cross was the figure and
        symbol of the spiritual curse of God. As in His body, then, He suffered
        this most accursed punishment, so likewise in His soul He suffered those
        pains that are most insupportable, such as are suffered by those finally
        condemned. But that was only for a short time, the infinity of His
        person rendering that suffering equivalent to that of an infinity of
        time. Such, then, was the grief which He experienced when on the cross
        He cried, ‘My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?’ What forsaking
        was this, unless that for a time God left Him to feel the weight of His
        indignation against sin? This feeling is the sovereign evil of the soul,
        in which consists the griefs of eternal death; as, on the other hand,
        the sovereign good of the soul, and that in which the happiness of
        eternal life consists, is to enjoy gracious communion with God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse we see the ground of the Apostle’s declaration, that there
        is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, because their
        sin was punished in Him. This is according to numerous other passages in
        Scripture, as, Isaiah 53:4-6; Galatians 3:13; 1 Peter 2:24; Revelation
        5:9; and, as it is said in 1 Timothy 2:6, ‘who gave Himself a ransom for
        all.’ For our sins are debts of which the payment and the satisfaction
        for them is their punishment — a payment without which we were held
        captives under the wrath and by the justice of God. All this shows that
        sin was really punished in Jesus Christ; and it is evident that,
        according to the justice and truth of God, such a punishment was
        necessary in order to our redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
        who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. That the
        righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us. — God not only sent
        His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might punish sin in
        that nature in which it had been committed, but that all which the law
        demands might by Him be fulfilled in those who are united to Him; for
        which purpose He obeyed its precepts as well as fulfilled its penalty.
        The original word here translated righteousness is the same as is
        rendered judgment or sentence, Romans 1:32, where, and also in the verse
        before us, it is in some of the French versions, and in the Dutch
        annotations, rendered ‘right.’ It is properly here the right of the law.
        The right of the law is twofold, being that which belongs to it at all
        times, or what only belongs to it in the event of sin. The first is
        obedience to its precepts; the second, subjection to its penalty. The
        first, or what may be called the proper right of the law, corresponds
        with its prosper end, according to which it was ordained unto life to
        all who obey it. What it demands beyond its proper or first end, is the
        fulfillment of its penalty, as cursing all who disobey it. For it is not
        the first end of the law to curse men, but only what it demands since
        the entrance of sin. Such is the right of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel does not take away this right; for it does not make void the
        law, Romans 3:31, but establishes it. In those, therefore, who are saved
        by the Gospel, they being all sinners, both the one and the other of the
        rights of the law are fulfilled in Christ, who is the end or fulfilling
        of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth, Romans 10:4.
        His people having sinned, He fulfills its right as to them, in suffering
        the punishment of sin, — namely, the curse of the law, to save them from
        punishment. And to introduce them into life. He accomplishes its proper
        or original right, according to which, as it is said, ‘the man that
        doeth them shall live in them.’ For if the Gospel establishes the law,
        it must do so as to its first end, and it must also do so as to its end
        since the entrance of sin, otherwise the law would, as to those who are
        saved, rather be abolished than fulfilled by the Gospel. In this way
        Christ has fully satisfied the law, having fulfilled its righteousness,
        — all that conformity to it which is its right in every respect, and
        under every aspect, and as to every state of those who are its subjects.
        And as His people are in Him, so the law is thus, in all its extent,
        fulfilled in them, which is the very circumstance in which their
        justification consists. For if they are one body, or one with Him, as
        the Apostle had been showing, His fulfillment of the law is their
        fulfillment of it. Such being their communion with Him, that they sit
        with Him in heavenly places, Ephesians 2:6; and by the same communion
        His righteousness is their righteousness, 2 Corinthians 5:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        The end, then, of Christ’s mission was, that the right of the law might
        be fulfilled in His people. Here we see the ground on which believers
        are saved. It is in a way consistent with the law, a way in which all
        that it has a right to demand is fulfilled in them. The mercy, then,
        which saves sinners does not interfere with justice. They who are saved
        by mercy have that very righteousness which the law demands. In Christ
        they have paid the penalty of their disobedience, and in Christ they
        have yielded obedience to every precept of the law. This fulfillment of
        the law cannot signify, as some commentators erroneously explain it,
        that obedience which believers are enabled to yield by the Holy Spirit
        in their regenerate state; for it is obvious that this is not the
        righteousness of the law. The very best of all their actions and
        thoughts come short of the perfection which the law demands; besides,
        its penalty would in this way be unfulfilled. They are indeed
        sanctified, but their sanctification is far from being commensurate with
        the claims of the holy law, either as to its penalty or its precept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, then, is solid consolation for the believer in Jesus. For,
        divested as he is of righteousness in himself, he enjoys the blessedness
        of having the righteousness of God — the righteousness of his Lord and
        Savior — imputed to Him, so that the law which had been broken is
        fulfilled in him in all its precepts, and in its full penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hitherto, from the beginning of the 2nd verse, the Apostle had been
        illustrating the truth contained in the first clause of the first verse,
        namely, that there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.
        He now repeats the last clause of that verse which he goes on to
        illustrate to the end of the 8th verse. Who walk not after (according
        to) the flesh, but after ( according to) the Spirit. — These words
        characterize those in whom the righteousness of the law is fulfilled and
        serve the double purpose of showing that they who are walking according
        to the principles of the renewed spiritual nature, and according to that
        covenant of which the Lord Jesus is the spirit, are one with Him, and
        that none are united to Him who are living after the principles of their
        corrupt nature, and seeking justification and acceptance with God, by
        cleaving to the covenant of works. The expression, to ‘walk,’ is
        frequently employed in Scripture regarding any particular line of
        conduct, as when it is said, Acts 21:21, ‘that they ought not to
        circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs; ‘or it
        denotes the course of life in which we are proceeding as in Ephesians
        2:2, ‘Ye walked according to the course of this world.’ In this way,
        comparing our life to a journey, in the usual style of Scripture, the
        Apostle comprehends all our actions under the figure of walking. To
        walk, then, according to the flesh, is to act agreeably to the
        principles of corrupt nature. To walk according to the Spirit, means to
        regulate the conduct according to the influence and dictates of the Holy
        Spirit, who has given us a new nature, serving God in newness of spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms flesh and spirit have various significations, and are employed
        in different senses in this chapter. The word flesh is used in a sense
        either bad or indifferent. Sometimes it means simply human nature, and
        sometimes corrupt human nature, or man in his natural state without the
        Holy Spirit, and frequently wicked works. At other times it denotes
        outward services in adherence to the law for justification, Philippians
        3:4. To the word spirit various meanings are likewise attached. It
        imports either the angelic nature, or the soul of man, or the Holy
        Spirit, or the renewed image of the Son of God in the soul. In both of
        these last senses it is employed by our Lord, when, declaring the
        necessity of regeneration, He says, ‘That which is born of the Spirit is
        spirit.’ Sometimes, when opposed to flesh or to letter, it is used as
        equivalent to the new covenant, — ’who also hath made us able ministers
        of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit.’ The
        expression, walking not according to the flesh, but according to the
        Spirit, in the verse before us, is generally interpreted as referring
        exclusively to the practice of good or of wicked works. It is supposed
        that the Apostle is here guarding his doctrine of gratuitous
        justification from abuse, by excluding all claim to union with Christ,
        and to exemption from condemnation, where there is not purity of
        conduct, under the influence of the Holy Spirit. This is undoubtedly a
        highly important truth, which is to be constantly affirmed and insisted
        on. Holiness of life and conversation is an inseparable concomitant of
        union with Christ; for to whom He is made righteousness He is also made
        sanctification, and they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with
        the affections and lusts. Of this the Apostle never loses sight, not
        indeed in any point of view as the cause of that union, but as its
        never-failing consequence and concomitant, as he has abundantly proved
        in the sixth chapter. There are, however, many different paths in the
        broad way; that is, many ways of walking after the flesh, all of which
        lead to destruction. Among these, that of seeking acceptance with God by
        works of righteousness, either moral or ceremonial, is equally
        incompatible with union to Christ and freedom from condemnation, as
        living in the grosser indulgence of wicked works; and this way of going
        about to establish their own righteousness, by those who profess to have
        received the Gospel, and who have even a zeal of God, ch. 10:2, is
        probably that by which the greater number of them are deceived. There is
        the greatest danger lest the fleshly wisdom, under the notion of a zeal
        for God and of regard for the interests of virtue, should set men on the
        painful endeavor of working out their salvation, in part at least, by
        keeping the law as a covenant, thus attending to its requirements for
        justification, serving in the oldness of the letter, and not in the
        newness of spirit. In this ways multitudes who profess to have received
        the Gospel, are walking after the flesh, seeking to satisfy their
        conscience, and saying peace when there is no peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        While, therefore, the other ways of walking according to the flesh may
        all be comprehended under the term as here employed by the Apostle, for
        they are all involved in each other, it would appear (especially as in
        the 5th verse, minding the things of the flesh, which certainly denotes
        immoral conduct, is distinguished from walking after the flesh) that it
        is to the above import of the word, rather than to immoral conduct, that
        he is referring in this place. In this way Paul himself walked before
        his conversion, when he thought that he ought to do many things contrary
        to the name of Jesus of Nazareth; and it was this same way of walking
        according to the flesh which he so strenuously opposes in his Epistle to
        the churches of Galatia. We see, too, how suitable to his purpose it
        would be in confirming the doctrine he had been teaching, particularly
        to direct to this point the attention of those to whom he was writing.
        Paul, then, appears to be here prosecuting his main design, which is to
        prove that believers are to be justified, not by works of righteousness
        which they have done, of whatever description, but solely by faith in
        Jesus Christ, in whom their reconciliation with God is complete. It is
        this grand truth which, from the beginning of the Epistle, he had been
        exhibiting, for the conviction and establishment in the faith of those
        whom he addressed. It is indeed a truth in which Christians need to be
        fully instructed, which they are all apt to let slip out of their minds,
        but by which they are saved, if they keep it in memory. There is nothing
        which so much retards them in their course as their proneness to walk
        according to the flesh, in seeking to establish their own righteousness;
        and nothing more powerfully tends, when giving way to it in any degree,
        to bring them into bondage, to lead them to serve in the oldness of the
        letter, and not in newness of spirit, and to mar their joy and peace in
        believing. In the sense here ascribed to it, the word flesh is employed
        in the beginning of the fourth chapter of this Epistle. Flesh, in that
        place, cannot, it is evident, signify immoral conduct; for that Abraham
        was justified by wicked works could never be supposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It must there signify works, moral or ceremonial, as is proved by the
        rest of that chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Epistle to the Galatians, the terms flesh and spirit are likewise
        used in this acceptation. ‘Are ye so foolish? having begun in the
        Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?’ Galatians 3:3. ‘Having
        begun your Christian course by receiving the doctrine of the new
        covenant, namely, justification by the righteousness of Christ, are ye
        seeking to be made perfect by legal observances, or works of any kind?’
        In this passage the word flesh cannot be taken for wicked works, any
        more than in the fourth chapter of the Romans, just quoted. It must be
        understood in the sense of working for life, or self-justification, in
        opposition to the way of salvation according to the Gospel. The
        Apostle’s main object, in the whole of that Epistle, is to reclaim the
        Galatian churches from the error of mixing ceremonial observances, or
        any works of law, with the faith of Christ, and thus walking according
        to the flesh, and not according to the Spirit. ‘Behold, I Paul say unto
        you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I
        testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to
        do the whole law. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of
        you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from (the doctrine of)
        grace. For we, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by
        faith.’ This reasoning applies to all works of law, of whatever
        description, as clearly appears by the third chapter of that Epistle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same manner, the terms flesh and Spirit are employed, Philippians
        3:3, ‘For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and
        rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the word flesh, opposed to Spirit, just as in the passage before
        us, cannot signify immoral conduct, in which it would be absurd to
        suppose that the Apostle placed confidence. In the sequel, Paul
        furnishes a practical commentary on these words, by referring to his own
        conduct, as having formerly walked according to the flesh, resting in
        external privileges, and observances, and his obedience to the law; but
        afterwards as renouncing them all, and relying solely on ‘the
        righteousness which is of God by faith.’
      </p>
      <p>
        According, then, to the above signification of the word flesh, as
        employed in the fourth chapter of this Epistle, and of the word Spirit;
        denoting the new covenant, 2 Corinthians 3:6, this clause, ‘who walk not
        according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit,’ indicates the
        course of those who are not walking according to the old covenant, in
        seeking justification by the works of law, but who attain it by faith in
        Him who is the Lord the Spirit, 2 Corinthians 3:17. The same idea
        appears to be expressed here as in the preceding chapter, where the
        Apostle reminds believers that they are delivered from the law under
        which, while in the flesh, they were held, that they should serve in
        newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. This is
        consistent with the whole of the previous train of the Apostle’s
        reasoning, in which, as was already noticed, he has been asserting the
        freedom of believers from the law, and their justification by the
        righteousness of Christ through faith, in opposition to all
        self-justifying efforts or obedience of their own. They, then, who walk
        not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, are no longer
        seeking justification by works of law, but are brought to act on Gospel
        and spiritual principles. They live in the Spirit, and they also walk in
        the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        All men who profess to worship God in any form, walk by nature according
        to the flesh. As man was originally placed under the law to live by his
        obedience to it, so, ever since it has been broken, he naturally seeks
        acceptance with God, and justification by the works of law. This is
        fully verified at all times, and in all nations, by those who are not in
        Christ. All men, without exception, have the work of the law written in
        their hearts, and if ignorant of the only Savior of sinners, they
        attempt to satisfy their conscience by means of some religious
        observances or moral works, — the idolater, by his sacrifices; the
        Mohammedan, by his lustrations; the Brahmin, by his austerities; the
        Roman Catholic, by his masses and penances; the Socinian, by his vaunted
        philanthropy; the nominal Christian, by his assiduous attendance at the
        Lord’s Supper and other religious services: and all, in some way or
        other, by the merit of their works, moral or ceremonial, seek to obtain
        their acquittal from sin before God, and a favorable sentence at His
        tribunal. All of them are going about to establish their own
        righteousness, being ignorant of the righteousness of God. In this way
        Saul of Tarsus, as has been noticed, describes himself as having walked,
        when he had ‘confidence in the flesh.’ To wait, through the Spirit, for
        the hope of righteousness by faith, Galatians 5:5, is peculiar to those
        to whom, being in Christ Jesus, there is no condemnation, and in whom
        the righteousness of the law is by Him fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The verse before us, and the three preceding, contain a summary of the
        whole that Paul had advanced in the foregoing part of the Epistle, both
        respecting the justification and the sanctification of believers, and
        open the way for illustrating the difference between those who are
        carnal — remaining in their natural state — and those who are spiritual,
        as renewed by grace. This afterwards leads to a particular and most
        interesting description, through the remainder of the chapter, of the
        various trials of believers, as also of their unspeakably glorious
        privileges, and of the gracious operations and influences of the Holy
        Spirit in the great work of their sanctification, and to the Apostle’s
        concluding the whole by the most sublime view of the eternal source and
        absolute security of the state of dignity and blessedness to which,
        through Divine favor, they have been elevated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — For they that are after the, flesh do mind the things of the
        flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        This appears to confirm the explanation that has been given of the last
        clause of the first verse and of that of the fourth; for the Apostle
        here distinguishes between walking after the flesh, and mining the
        things of the flesh, and between walking after the Spirit, and minding
        the things of the Spirit. As he had proved that union with Christ was
        necessary to justification, he here shows that its certain consequence
        is also sanctification; while they who do not enjoy this union are still
        under the dominion of sin. For they that are after the flesh do mind the
        things of the flesh. — This verse connects with the preceding, and
        contrasts the opposite effects that follow from walking according to the
        flesh, or according to the Spirit. The word here translated ‘mind,’
        includes both the understanding and the affections, and signifies the
        strong bent of the mind regarding the object desired. The minding of the
        flesh comprehends all the faculties of man in his unregenerate state,
        there being no power of the mind exempt from sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, then, a man walks according to the flesh, seeking acceptance with
        God by his own works, moral or ceremonial, however earnest or sincere he
        may be in his endeavors, he will remain under the prevalence and
        dominion of sinful appetites. Such persons have their minds intent on
        the things that gratify their corrupt nature. They have no relish for
        spiritual things; whatever they may be induced to do from dread of
        punishment, or hope of reward in a future world, their desires are, in
        reality, centered in the things of this world. Whatever may be their
        profession of religion, their hearts are supremely engrossed with
        earthly things; and for these, if they could obtain their wish through
        eternity, they would gladly barter all the glories of heaven. In one
        word, they mind the things of the flesh, they love the world, and all
        that is in the world. ‘If any man love the world, the love of the Father
        is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and
        the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but
        is of the world.’ But they that are after the Spirit the things of the
        Spirit. — They who act according to the principles of the renewed
        spiritual nature, and seek acceptance with God by faith in Him who is
        ‘the Lord the Spirit,’ Corinthians 3:17, mind spiritual things. Jesus
        Christ is the source of every blessing, and they who are in Him are not
        only justified, and consequently freed from condemnation, but also walk
        in newness of life. They employ their thoughts and efforts about the
        things of God. To these they attend, and on these their affections are
        fixed. None will seek the things which are above, but those who serve
        God in newness of spirit. All others will ‘mind earthly things,’
        Philippians 3:19.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the verse before us Mr. Adam of Wintringham remarks, ‘For they that
        are after the flesh, that is, according to the common interpretation,
        not led and governed by the Spirit in practice, “still under the
        direction of the flesh and its sinful appetites,” says Mr. Lock, do mind
        the things of the flesh: very true; but then this is only affirming a
        thing of itself, or saying it twice over. And therefore, to clear St.
        Paul of this absurdity, we suppose that by “they that are after the
        flesh,” he means those who are destitute of faith, or not in Christ: and
        of them he affirms that, let them pretend to do what they will, they are
        still under the prevalence of flesh and its appetites, and cannot act
        from a higher principle, or a nature which they have not. And it must be
        observed that he is now advancing a step farther in the doctrine of
        faith, and, besides the necessity of it in order to justification,
        showing its happy effects as a principle of holiness: but they that are
        after the Spirit — in the Spirits dispensation of grace, through faith —
        and say that. Jesus is the Lord by the Holy Ghost, by whom only they can
        say it, mind the things of the Spirit, now possessing and ruling them.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually
        minded is life and peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse the Apostle contrasts the dispositions and
        practices of believers and unbelievers; here he contrasts their opposite
        states and conditions. These two states of carnal and spiritual
        mindedness include and divide the whole world. All men belong either to
        the one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are either in the flesh or in the Spirit; in a state of nature or
        in a state of grace. For to be carnally minded is death. — This is the
        awful state of the carnal mind — the mind of the flesh without faith in
        Christ, and renovation of the Spirit of God. It is death spiritual and
        eternal. All the works of those who are in this state are ‘dead works,’
        Hebrews 9:14. ‘The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the
        Lord,’ although the Lord commanded to offer sacrifices, which therefore
        was in itself a good work. ‘She that liveth in pleasure is dead while
        she liveth.’ All by nature being in this carnal state, are ‘dead in
        trespasses and sins.’ Let those whose minds are set on the things of the
        world consider this fearful saying, that to be carnally minded is death,
        and let them look to Jesus the Savior of the guilty, through whom alone
        they can escape condemnation. But to be spiritually minded is life and
        peace. — These are the effects of being enlightened and guided by the
        Spirit of God, and so having the mind turned from earthly things to the
        things of the Spirit. To be spiritually minded is life, even eternal
        life. This life is already enjoyed by the believer. ‘Whoso eateth My
        flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life;’ and with his Redeemer
        he has risen from the death of sin to walk in this new life. It is also
        peace, both here and hereafter. This peace is the harmony of all the
        faculties of the soul with God, and with His will, and is altogether the
        opposite of that enmity against God, which in the following verse is
        affirmed concerning the carnal mind. While there is nothing so miserable
        for man as war with his Creator, there is nothing so blessed as peace
        and communion with God. It is peace in the conscience, in opposition to
        doubt, for which the Church of Rome contends, as if the effect of being
        spiritually minded, instead of peace and confidence in God, was servile
        fear and harassing distrust. That church maintains that the man who is
        regenerated should doubt of his salvation, and be uncertain of God’s
        love to him. What, then, becomes of this peace that flows from being
        spiritually minded — which passeth all understanding, keeping the heart
        and mind through Christ Jesus — this peace, which is one of the fruits
        of the Spirit, and a characteristic of the kingdom of God? Romans 14:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        The peace here spoken of is opposed to the terrors of conscience which
        the unregenerate experience, and to the opposition in their hearts to
        God, as well as to every species of false peace by which they may be
        deluded. ‘There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.’ And again it
        is said, ‘Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
        Thee, because he trusteth in Thee.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not
        subject to law of God neither indeed can be Because the carnal mind is
        enmity against God. — The word rendered carnal mind — or, as it may be
        rendered, minding of the flesh — comprehends the acts both of the
        understanding and of the will. Some render it the prudence, or wisdom,
        of the flesh — or the wise thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The carnal mind in its wisest thoughts is rooted enmity against God.
        This is the reason why the carnal mind is punished with death. The mind
        of the flesh, or of man in his unconverted state, walking according to
        the flesh, in its best as well as in its worst character — however moral
        in conduct — .whether seeking acceptance with God by its own services,
        or following altogether the course of this world in its sinful practices
        — is not merely an enemy, but enmity itself against God in the
        understanding, will, and affections. Every man whose heart is set on
        this world hates God, John 2:15. ‘If any man love the world, the love of
        the Father is not in him;’ and the heart of every one who has not been
        renewed in his mind by the Spirit of God is set on this world. Such men
        hate the holiness of God, His justice, His sovereignty, and even His
        mercy in the way in which it is exercised. Men of this character,
        however, have no notion that they hate God. Nay, many of them profess to
        love Him. But God’s testimony is, that they are His enemies; and His
        testimony is to be taken against the testimony of all men. This,
        however, does not suppose that men may not imagine that they love God.
        But is it not the true God whom they are regarding, but a God of their
        own imagination — a God all mercy, and therefore a God unjust; while
        they abhor the just God, and the Savior, who is the God of the
        Scriptures. ‘He that cometh to God must believe that He is,’ Hebrews
        11:6. He must believe that He is what He is. For it is not subject to
        the law of God. — The carnal mind is not under subjection to the law of
        God. Whatever it may do to obtain salvation or avoid wrath, it does it
        not from subjection to the law. It has a rooted aversion to the
        spiritual law of God, and admits not its claim to perfect and unceasing
        obedience. All its performances in the way of religion spring from
        selfish motives, and a hope that, on account of these doings, it will be
        accepted; whereas the holy law of God utterly rejects all such service.
        So far from giving the law all its demands, the carnal mind gives it
        nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing which it does constitutes obedience to the law. The law does not
        in any degree, or in any instance, recognize the works of the carnal
        mind as obedience to its requirements. Neither indeed can be. — Not only
        is it a matter of fact that the carnal mind is not subject to the law of
        God, but such subjection is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sin cannot be in subjection to the law. This would be a contradiction in
        terms. For, so far as it would be subject to the law of God, it would be
        holy. If, then, sin is essentially, and in direct terms, contrary to
        holiness, the sinful nature can never yield subjection to the holy law.
        Men may speculate about metaphysical possibilities; but whatever
        explanation may be given of the matter, the decision of the inspired
        Apostle determines that the thing is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        That an unconverted man cannot be subject to the law of God, appears to
        many a hard saying; but it is the uniform doctrine of the word of God.
        All men in their natural state, though they boast that they are free,
        are the slaves of sin. Then Jesus, addressing the Jews who professed to
        believe in Him, but who understood not His doctrine, said to them, ‘Ye
        shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,’ they answered,
        ‘We were never in bondage to any man; how sayest Thou, Ye shall be made
        free?’ In the same manner the unconverted boast of their freedom. They
        affirm that their will is free; and that, as they can choose the evil,
        so they can choose the good. If, by this freedom, they intend that they
        can choose without any external force constraining or preventing them,
        it is true that, in this sense, they are free. But a moral agent chooses
        according to his inclinations or dispositions. It should always be
        recollected that the will is the will of the mind, and the judgment the
        judgment of the mind. It is the mind that judges and that wills. A fool
        judges foolishly; a wicked man judges wickedly; a good man wills that
        which is good. In Scripture, it is said that God cannot deny Himself;
        that He cannot lie. His nature being perfectly holy, it is impossible
        that He can do what is wrong. On the other hand, the wicked and
        condemned spirits cannot choose what is holy. When the devil ‘speaketh a
        lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.’
        Man, therefore, in his carnal state, chooses what is evil; but he cannot
        choose what is good, not indeed because of any external obstruction, for
        in that case he would not be criminal, but by reason of the opposition
        of his perverse dispositions. He is inclined to do evil, and evil he
        will do. ‘Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
        then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.’ His language
        is, ‘I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.’ ‘As for the word
        that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken
        unto thee.’ ‘My people would not hearken to My voice, and Israel would
        have none of Me.’ They say ‘unto God, Depart from us.’ ‘Depart from us;
        for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.’ ‘We will not have this man
        to reign over us.’ ‘Let us break their bands asunder, and cast their
        cords from us.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is thus that ‘wickedness proceedeth from the wicked.’ ‘Neither can a
        corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.’ ‘Wept a man be born again, he
        cannot see the kingdom of God.’ ‘Except a man be born of water, and of
        the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.’ ‘How can ye
        believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that
        cometh from God only?’ ‘No man can come to Me except the Father which
        hath sent Me, draw him.’ ‘Therefore said I unto you, that no man can
        come unto Me except it were given unto him of My Father.’ ‘The natural
        man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
        foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
        spiritually discerned.’ ‘Their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot
        hearken.’ ‘How can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the
        abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.’ ‘The Spirit of truth whom
        the world cannot receive.’ ‘Why do ye not understand My speech? even
        because ye cannot hear My word.’ ‘No man can say that Jesus is the Lord,
        but by the Holy Ghost.’
      </p>
      <p>
        According, then, to Scripture, the natural man is entirely incapable of
        choosing what is good, although it is his duty, and therefore fit that
        it should be enjoined on him. He is ‘ungodly,’ a ‘sinner,’ an ‘enemy to
        God,’ and ‘without strength,’ Romans 5:6,10. Men in this state are
        represented as walking according to the prince of the power of the air,
        the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience; as being
        under ‘the power of Satan,’ and ‘taken captive by him at his will.’ They
        are his lawful captives, because they are so voluntarily. From this
        slavery they cannot be freed but by means of the word of God, the sword
        of the Spirit, which the Lord employs; granting to those to whom it
        seemeth good to Him the blessing of regeneration; ‘distributing His
        gifts, and dividing to every man severally as He will.’ It is God ‘who
        hath delivered us,’ says the Apostle, ‘from the power of darkness, and
        hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.’ ‘Who worketh in
        you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.’ ‘If the Son shall make
        you free, ye shall be free indeed.’
      </p>
      <p>
        When God purposes to do good to men, He fulfills to them this gracious
        promise, ‘I will give them a heart to know Me.’ It was this preparation
        of heart that David prayed to God to grant to his son Solomon. At the
        same time, he acknowledged with gratitude that his own willingness to
        offer to God, of which he was Conscious, and that of his people, were
        from Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        After celebrating the praises of Jehovah, David says, ‘But who am I, and
        what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after
        this sort? For all things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given
        Thee.
      </p>
      <p>
        O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for
        ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and
        prepare their hearts unto Thee,’ 1 Chronicles 29:10-18.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is nothing to prevent men from obeying the will of God but their
        own depraved dispositions, and aversion to the things of God. The
        natural faculties of men would be sufficient to enable them to do what
        He commands, if they employ them properly. If they employ them
        otherwise, the fault rests exclusively with themselves. And as the
        corruption of our nature does not deprive a man of any of his natural
        faculties, or of perfect liberty to act conformably to the decision of
        his own mind, the obligation under which he lies to do right continues
        in full force. From this we see, first, how justly God punishes men for
        their crimes, who, unless inclined and enabled by His grace, cannot
        liberate themselves from the slavery of sin; and further, that the
        inability of men to obey God, not being natural but moral inability,
        cannot deprive God of the right to command obedience, under the pain of
        His most awful displeasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this subject, the distinction between natural and moral inability
        should always be kept in view. Natural inability consists in a defect in
        the mind or body, which deprives a man of the power of knowing or doing
        anything, however desirous he may be of knowing or doing it. Natural
        inability, then, can never render a man criminal. Moral inability
        consists in an aversion to anything, so great that the mind, even when
        acting freely — that is, without any external impulse or constraint —
        cannot overcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this aversion exists as to what is good, it is inseparable from
        blame; and the greater this aversion is, the greater is the criminality.
        All men are daily accustomed to make these distinctions, and according
        to this rule they constantly form their opinion of the conduct of
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the nature of things, it is impossible that the justice of God can
        ever demand of reasonable creatures less than perfect obedience. To say
        that the moral inability of man to obey the law of God destroys or
        weakens, in the smallest degree, his obligation to obey that law, is to
        add insult to rebellion. For what is that moral inability? It is, as has
        been observed, no other than aversion to God, the depraved inclination
        of the carnal mind, which not only entertains and cherishes enmity
        against God, but is itself that enmity. And let it not be said that the
        view the Scriptures give of the natural depravity of men, and of the
        sovereign and efficacious grace of God, reduces them to the condition of
        machines. Between men and machines there is this essential difference,
        and it is enough for us to know that man is a voluntary agent both in
        the state of nature and of grace. He wills and acts according to his own
        dispositions, while machines have neither thought nor will. As long,
        then, as a man’s will is depraved and opposed to God, his conduct will
        be bad, — he will fulfill the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and,
        on the other hand, when God gives the sinner a new disposition, and a
        new spirit, his conduct will undergo a corresponding change. ‘The
        liberty of a moral agent consists in the power of acting conformably to
        his choice. Every action performed without external constraint, and in
        pursuance of the determination of the soul itself, is a free action. The
        soul is determined by motives; but we constantly see the same motives
        acting diversely on different minds. Many do not act conformably to the
        motives of which they yet acknowledge all the force.
      </p>
      <p>
        This failure of the motive proceeds from obstacles opposed by the
        corruption of the heart and understanding. But God, in giving a new
        heart and a new spirit, takes away these obstacles; and, in removing
        them, far from depriving a man of liberty, He removes that which
        hindered him from acting freely, and from following the light of his
        conscience, and thus, as the Scriptures express it, makes him free. The
        will of man, without Divine grace, is not free but enslaved, and willing
        to be so.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it objected, that if a man be so entirely corrupt that he cannot do
        what is right, he should not be blamed for doing evil? To this it is
        sufficient to reply, that if there be any force in the objection, the
        more a voluntary agent is diabolically wicked, the more innocent he
        should be considered. A creature is not subject to blame if he is not a
        voluntary agent; but if he be so, and if his dispositions and his will
        were absolutely wicked, he would certainly be incapable of doing good,
        and, according to the above argument, he could not be blamed for doing
        evil. On this ground the devil must be excused, nay, held perfectly
        innocent, in his desperate and irreconcilable enmity against God. A
        consequence so monstrous totally destroys the force of the objection
        whence it is deduced. But if the objection be still pressed — if any one
        shall proudly demand, who hath resisted His will?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why hath He made me thus? — the only proper answer is that of the
        Apostle, ‘Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Some, indeed, taking a different and the most common view of this
        matter, deny the innate depravity of their nature, and, in spite of all
        that the Scriptures declare on this subject, persist in maintaining that
        they have not an inclination to evil, and are under no moral incapacity
        to do what is right.
      </p>
      <p>
        To such persons the same reply should be made as that of our Lord to the
        ignorant young man who asked Him what he should do to inherit eternal
        life. ‘If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.’ You cannot
        refuse to admit that this is your duty. You ought to love God with all
        your heart, and soul, and strength, and in all things constantly to obey
        Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you done so? No! Then, on your own principles, you are justly
        condemned, for you say that you can do what is right, and yet you have
        not done it. If, then, you will not submit unconditionally, and without
        reserve, to be saved in the way which the Gospel points out, in which
        you learn at once your malady and the remedy of which you stand in need,
        your blood will be upon your own head. ‘Now, you say, We see; therefore
        your sin remaineth.’ The whole, then, resolves itself into this, that
        all is according to the good pleasure of God. ‘Either make the tree good
        and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt;
        for the tree is known by his fruit. Every good tree bringeth forth good
        fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot
        bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
        fruit. Ye shall know them by their fruits.’ Every man, then, being by
        nature bad, must be made good before he can do good. In this and the two
        preceding verses we observe the strong, and expressive, and accumulated
        terms in which the Apostle describes the alienation of the natural man
        from God. 1st , He declares that they who walk after the flesh, mind the
        things of the flesh; 2nd , That the minding of the flesh is death; 3rd ,
        That the carnal mind is enmity against God; 4th , That it is not subject
        to the law of God; 5th , That so great is the corruption of the carnal
        mind, that this is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the passage before us, we learn how miserable the state of man is
        by nature, since even his wisdom and intelligence, in his unconverted
        state, is enmity against God, so that he cannot submit himself to His
        law. We learn, too, that the ability both to will and to do anything
        good must be from God. We should adore His compassion and mercy to us,
        if our natural enmity against Him has been subdued, and we have been
        reconciled to God by the death of His Son. In proportion to the
        greatness of this compassion, we should place our entire confidence in
        Him as our covenant God. For if, when we were enmity against Him, He
        loved us, how much more now that we are reconciled and His children?
        Romans 5:10. And, since there are still remains of the flesh and enmity
        against God and His holy law in our minds, we ought to deny ourselves
        daily, and flee to Him who can and will entirely deliver us from the
        body of this death.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 8. — So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>
      <p>
        This is the result of what has been said. A man must be born of the
        Spirit before he can even begin to serve God. How unscriptural and
        pernicious, then, is that system which teaches men to seek to please God
        by commencing a religious life, that God may be induced to co-operate
        with them in their further exertions. If the man who is not born again
        cannot please God, every act of the sinner before faith must be
        displeasing to God. An action may be materially good in itself, but
        unless it proceeds from a right motive — the love of God — and be
        directed to a right end — his glory — it cannot be acknowledged by God.
        Before a man’s services can be acceptable, his person must be accepted,
        as it is said, ‘The Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering. ’
        ‘Without faith it is impossible to please God.’ It is by faith we are
        united to Christ, and so reconciled to God; and till this union and
        reconciliation take place, there can be no communion with Him. If, then,
        no man who is in the flesh — that is, in his natural or unconverted
        state — can please God, how dreadful is the situation of those who do
        not even profess to be renewed in the spirit of their mind! How many are
        there who discard the idea of regeneration!
      </p>
      <p>
        However specious may be the works of such persons in the eyes of men,
        they cannot please God; and not pleasing God, they must abide the
        condemnation that awaits all His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — But we are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that
        the Spirit of God and dwell in you. Now, if any man have not the Spirit
        of Christ, he is none of His.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verses the Apostle had given a description of carnal
        and spiritual mindedness. Here he applies what he had said to those whom
        he was addressing. Ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. — As the
        flesh is here taken for the nature of man corrupted by sin, so to be in
        the flesh signifies to be in a state of natural corruption. On the other
        hand, to be in the spirit signifies to be in a state of grace or
        regeneration, John 3:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flesh is a principle that attaches to the earth, and the things of the
        earth; but the spirit of regeneration is as a light, which, coming from
        heaven, elevates the mind to those things that are celestial. As to the
        understanding, the man in the flesh, or the carnal man, receiveth not
        the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness Unto him; but
        he who is in the spirit, or spiritual, knows and approves the will of
        God, having ‘the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
        God,’ ‘the eyes of his understanding being enlightened.’ The will of the
        carnal man is such that the imagination of his thoughts are only evil
        continually; but he who is spiritual his conscience purged from dead
        works to serve the living God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The affections of him who is carnal are enmity against God, and in
        rebellion against His law; but the spiritual man delights in the law of
        God, and loves His commandments. The former considers the things of the
        world as his sovereign good; the latter seeks the things that are above
        at the right hand of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not being in the flesh, but in the spirit, was the state of all in the
        church at Rome. All belonging to it were, as far as man could judge,
        ‘saints,’ ch. 1:7, the regenerated children of God. The Apostle was
        persuaded that they were all ‘his brethren’ in Christ, ‘full of
        goodness,’ ch. 15:14. It was meet for him to think this of them all,
        Philippians 1:7. They were not then in the corrupt state of nature, but
        in the Spirit, walking in the Spirit, renewed by the Spirit of God. How
        different at that period was the church at Rome from that apostate body
        which now usurps its name! Nor only are natural or carnal men recognized
        as its members, but, like the temples of heathenish, it is filled with
        abominations and filthiness. If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in
        you. — The Apostle, in order to confirm those to whom he wrote in the
        assurance of their happy condition, now calls their attention to the
        evidence of being in a converted state, namely, the indwelling of the
        Holy Spirit. ‘Hereby we know that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because
        He hath given us of His Spirit,’ John 4:13. This indwelling of the
        Spirit is a sure evidence of a renewed state; and believers should be
        careful not to grieve the Spirit, and should labor to enjoy a constant
        sense of His presence in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse the word spirit in the first occurrence imports the gift
        and grace of regeneration. In the 2nd and 3rd it denotes the Author of
        that gift, namely, the Holy Spirit, who is Jehovah, a person in the self
        existent Godhead; equal with the Father and the Son in every attribute.
        He is called the Spirit, as being the breather or inspirer of spiritual
        life. Everything done by Him in this character tends to holiness, and
        therefore He is so often called the Holy Spirit. It is His Divine office
        to apply the salvation of Jesus, and to make it effectual. He does all
        in the heirs of promise. The Father gave them to the Son, the Son
        redeemed them, but they are in the common mass of corruption, dead in
        trespasses and sins, till the Spirit of life opens their hearts to
        receive Him, enters into them, unites them by faith to the Savior, and
        makes them the subjects of a new birth. Of the Holy Spirit it is said, 1
        Corinthians 3:16, ‘Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that
        the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?’ If it be asked how the Holy Spirit,
        who is co-essential with the Father and the Son, and consequently
        infinite, can dwell in believers, the answer is, that though everywhere
        present, He is said nevertheless to dwell in them on account of His
        operation and the grace of regeneration, which He produces. It is the
        Holy Spirit who unites them to Christ the Lord. It is He who quickens
        and regenerates them, on account of which regeneration is called he
        ‘renewing of the Holy Ghost.’ He it is who leads, rules, and governs
        them, as it is said in the 14th verse, that as many as are led by the
        Spirit of God are the sons of God. What this expression, ‘dwell in you,’
        imports is, that being united to Jesus Christ and regenerated, the Holy
        Spirit dwells in His people not as inactive, but operates in them
        continually, and leads and governs them. In the indwelling, then, of the
        Holy Spirit, is included His gracious and continuing presence, and His
        operations in the soul. The effects of these are illumination,
        sanctification, supplication, and consolation. Of the Holy Spirit, one
        of the early Christian writers says, ‘He is the author of regeneration,
        the pledge of the promised inheritance, and, as it were, the handwriting
        of eternal salvation; who makes us the temple of God and His house, who
        intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, acting as our
        advocate and defender, dwelling in our bodies, and sanctifying them for
        immortality. He it is who fights against the flesh, hence the flesh
        fights against the Spirit.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is Jesus Christ who gives to His people the Holy Spirit. ‘It is
        expedient for you,’ He says, ‘that I go away; for if I go not away, the
        Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto
        you.’ At the ancient Pentecost, God gave the law to the people of Israel
        fifty days after the institution of the Passover. Jesus Christ, as being
        the body and truth of the typical ordinances, having chosen to suffer at
        the feast of the Passover, was pleased also to send forth the Holy
        Spirit on the day of Pentecost, who by His power accomplishes in the
        hearts of believers what the law outwardly required; for the law was a
        letter written in stone, and therefore in itself without efficacy; but
        the Holy Spirit is that internal power which He puts within them and
        writes on their hearts. As, then, in the ancient Pentecost, God had
        given the law inscribed in tables of stone, so on the Christian
        Pentecost, Jesus Christ, by the power of His Spirit, writes it in their
        hearts. ‘Ye’ says the Apostle, ‘are manifestly declared to be the
        epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
        Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables
        of the heart.’ And why do we so often read in the New Testament of the
        contrast between the spirit and the letter, but to teach us that we have
        in the Christian Pentecost, by the Spirit of Christ, the truth and
        effect which the law in vain required from sinners. Now, or rather, But,
        if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His. — Here is a
        necessary reservation. If the Spirit of God did not really dwell in any
        of those whom the Apostle addressed, they were still in the flesh,
        notwithstanding all their profession, and all their present appearances,
        and his persuasion respecting them. And no doubt some will be found to
        have escaped for a time the pollutions of the world, who may afterwards
        show that they were never renewed in heart. Many ridicule the
        pretensions of those who speak of the Holy Spirit as dwelling in
        believers; yet if the Spirit of God dwell not in any, they are still in
        the flesh; that is, they are enemies to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same Spirit that is called the Spirit of God in the preceding part
        of the sentence, is in this latter part called the Spirit of Christ,
        because Christ having, by virtue of His sacrifice, obtained the Spirit
        for His people, sends Him into their hearts, John 16:7. Christ, then,
        who sends the Holy Spirit, must be God. Every Christian has the Spirit
        of Christ dwelling in him. When Christ takes possession of any man as
        His, He puts His Holy Spirit within him. Without the presence of His
        Spirit, we can have no interest in Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but
        the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle having affirmed in the 2nd verse that the law of the Spirit
        of life had made him free from the law of sin and death, and having
        declared in the 3rd and 4th verses in what manner we are freed from the
        law as the law of sin, it remained for him to show how we are freed from
        it as the law of death. This he accordingly does here, and in the
        following verse. In the 7th and 8th verses, he had confirmed his
        declaration in the 6th, that to be carnally minded is death. He now
        illustrates the opposite declaration, that to be spiritually minded is
        life. He admits, however, that notwithstanding the believer’s communion
        with Christ, the body is dead; but to this he opposes the double
        consolation of the eternal life of our souls on account of the
        righteousness of Christ, and, in the next verse, the resurrection of our
        bodies through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is in this verse a triple opposition: first, of the body to the
        soul; second, of a state of death to a state of life; third, of sin to
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was necessary to remove the objection replied to in this verse,
        especially as the Apostle had said that to those who are in Christ Jesus
        there is no condemnation. Whence, then, it might be asked, does it
        happen that we who are in Him are still subject to death like other men?
        He answers, If Jesus Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because
        of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. In what
        follows, he abundantly shows that the temporary sufferings of believers,
        among which is the death of the body, are not worthy to be compared with
        the glory that shall be revealed in them; and that in the meantime all
        things that happen to them are working for their good. The term body is,
        in this verse, to be taken, as is evident from the following verse, in
        its literal signification; and by the spirit, as opposed to it, is meant
        the soul, as in the 16th verse, where our spirit is distinguished from
        the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, or rather, But, if Christ be in you. — The Apostle had just
        affirmed that if any man have not the, Spirit of Christ, he is none of
        His; but if He be in us, then the consequences here stated follow. Jesus
        Christ, in regard to His Divine nature, is everywhere present; but He is
        in a special manner in believers, as it is said, Ephesians 3:17, ‘That
        Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.’ This indwelling of Christ
        signifies two things, namely, the close and intimate union we have with
        Him, and His operation in us. As the Scriptures declare that Jesus
        Christ is in us, so they also assure us that we are in Him, ch. <450801>
        8:1; 1 Corinthians 1:30; Corinthians 5:17; Colossians 1:27. And thus we
        dwell in Him and He in us, John 6:56. This union with Jesus Christ is
        necessary, in order that He should work in us. For He works only in His
        members; so that, for this purpose, we must be first incorporated in
        Him, John 15:4. By this union we participate in His grace; because, as
        we are in Him and He in us, we have all things with Him in common. Our
        sins are reputed His sins, and His righteousness ours. He that
        persecutes His people persecutes Him; he that touches them touches the
        apple of His eye. And as in this life they partake of His grace, so in
        the life to come they shall participate in His glory. The body is dead —
        Notwithstanding our union with Jesus Christ, our bodies are dead. The
        Scriptures speak of three kinds of death: one is in this life, the other
        at the end of this life, and the third after this life. The first is
        spiritual death, Ephesians 2:1; Colossians 2:13. Natural death takes
        place at the separation of the soul from the body; and after this life
        is the second, or eternal death, which consists in everlasting
        destruction from the presence of the Lord. It is only of the second or
        natural death that the Apostle here speaks, for believers are delivered
        from the first and the third. He says the body is dead, to show that it
        is the lowest part of man that for a time is affected by death, as it is
        said, ‘Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was,’ Ecclesiastes
        12:7. Because of sin. — Men die for the sin of Adam. ‘By one man sin
        entered into the world, and death by sin’ and God said, ‘In the day that
        thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’ But why do believers die,
        since death is the punishment of sin, and as to them God hath remitted
        this punishment? for the Apostle shows, chapter 4, that their sins are
        not imputed to them; in chapter 6, that they are dead to sin; and in the
        beginning of the chapter before us, that there is no condemnation to
        them which are in Christ Jesus. Jesus Christ, too, has made complete
        satisfaction for the punishment of their sins, sin having been condemned
        in His flesh. The Apostle also says, ‘Christ has redeemed us from the
        curse of the law, being made a curse for us;’ but death is among the
        curses of the law. We must then distinguish between death considered in
        itself, and in its nature, and as having changed its nature in Jesus
        Christ our Lord. In itself, death is the punishment of sin and the curse
        of the law, and it is such to the wicked and unbelievers. But, by the
        work of Christ, it is to His people no more a punishment of sin, but the
        destruction of sin. It is no more the curse of the law, but is changed
        into a blessing, and has become the passage to eternal life, and the
        entrance into the heavenly paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The death of believers does not, then, in the least degree derogate from
        the complete satisfaction of Jesus Christ, and the perfect redemption
        from the curse of the law, since their death is not a punishment of sin
        in vindictive justice, as all the afflictions of this life as well as
        death are to the enemies of God. But by Jesus Christ, in respect to
        those whom the Father hath given to Him, and who are united to Him, God
        acts in mercy, and afflictions and death are only chastisements from His
        fatherly hand — trials of their faith, and salutary discipline, as the
        Apostle in this chapter declares that all things work together for good;
        and in the First Epistle, to the Corinthians 3:22, that all things are
        theirs, whether life or death, God has established another covenant,
        which is that of grace, according to which those who partake in the
        death of Christ, by which that sentence was, as to them, carried into
        full execution, must indeed die; but death to them is swallowed up in
        victory; and instead of the day of their death being a day of punishment
        of sin, it is a day of triumph over death. The death of the body is as
        to them the preparation for its immortality and in corruption, as the
        seed deposited in the earth passes in such a way through death as to
        overcome it, and revives and fructifies, so that when in the earth it is
        not lost. In like manner the bodies of believers do not perish by death,
        but derive from the grave what is contrary to its natural character.
        They are sown in corruption, but they are to rise in corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are sown in weakness, but they are to rise in power. They are sown
        in dishonor, but they are to rise in glory. They are sown natural
        bodies, but they are to rise spiritual bodies. And as to the soul, death
        indeed separates it from the body, but transmits it to God. It is
        evident, then, that such a death is not a punishment of sin, or a curse
        of the law. Its end and use to the regenerate, as to their bodies, is to
        extirpate and destroy the sin that remains in them: they must die in
        order to be purified. The infusion of that moral poison has so corrupted
        our bodies, that, like the leprous house, they must be taken down and
        renewed, to be purified from sin. As the grain is not quickened except
        it die, in the same way our bodies die and molder in the dust, to be
        revived and reconstructed in holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it be said that God, without dooming His people to die, could have
        changed them in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, as He will do with
        respect to those who shall survive to the day of His coming, it should
        be considered that the wisdom of God hath judged it proper that the
        believer should be subjected to the death of the body. This tends to
        lead him to hold sin in abhorrence whence death proceeds. He also sees
        in death the goodness and the severity of God, and by it and his other
        afflictions he may judge what will be the end of those whom God punishes
        in His anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        He may observe in it the goodness of God to him in depriving it of its
        sting, and ordering it so that he may more fully taste the sweetness of
        a lasting and immortal life. Such discipline, too, tends to humble the
        believer, by which also his graces, given to him by God, are increased,
        and the power of the Lord made manifest in his weakness. Finally,
        believers die, that in their death they may be conformed to Jesus
        Christ; for it He died, shall they, who are His members, be exempt from
        this lot? and if He must in that way enter into His glory, shall they,
        who are His members, enter by any other way? And this assuredly is a
        great consolation, that in dying we follow Jesus Christ, our Head, who
        hath gone before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eye of nature, which loves its preservation, regards death with
        fear, in which it sees its destruction. The eye of the flesh, which is
        enmity against God, regards it with still greater dread, perceiving in
        it the summons to stand before the tribunal of God. But the believer, by
        the eye of faith, discovers in death what dissipates the fears of
        nature, and repels the despair of the flesh. To nature, which apprehends
        its destruction, faith opposes the weakness of death, which cannot
        prevent the resurrection; and to the condemnation which the flesh
        apprehends, opposes that life which it discovers under the mask of
        death. It sees that, though its appearance be terrific, yet in Christ it
        has lost its sting. It is like the phantom walking on the sea which
        approached to the terrified disciples, but it was Jesus Christ their
        Lord and Savior. If unknown evils that may happen in death be
        apprehended, the believer remembers that the very hairs of his head are
        all numbered. Jesus, who is with him he knows will not abandon him. He
        will not permit him to be tempted above what he is able to bear, for
        ‘precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature, then, of death, is changed to believers by Jesus Christ, so
        that ‘the day of their death is better than the day of their birth.’
        Death to them is no more a curse, but a blessing, which puts an end to
        their sins and troubles, causing them to pass to perfect holiness and
        happiness, and from being absent from the Lord to carry them into His
        presence in paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
        From being strangers on the earth, it introduces them into their
        heavenly inheritance. From their wanderings and agitations here below,
        it brings them into the haven of everlasting rest. If the children of
        Israel, when they arrived at the river Jordan, were dismayed at the over
        flowings of its waters, had they not reason to rejoice when they beheld
        on the other side that fertile land which God had promised them, and
        into which they were about to enter to enjoy its fruits? But, above all,
        had they not cause of encouragement when they saw that the ark of the
        covenant was in the midst of Jordan? Death is the passage of Jordan by
        which believers enter the heavenly Canaan. In order that its waves may
        not overwhelm them in passing, Jesus Christ arrests them, since He is in
        His people, and consequently with them. This was David’s support,
        ‘Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
        evil; for Thou art with me.’ When the devouring lion roars around His
        people, ready to destroy them, Jesus Himself is still nearer to defend
        them; and He commands His angels to encamp about them, who have in
        charge to bear their spirits to the paradise of God. But the spirit is
        life. — To the fact that the body is dead, the Apostle here opposes, as
        a ground of comfort, the consideration that our souls are life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The life here spoken of is the life of God in the soul; it is the new
        and eternal life which His Spirit communicates in regeneration. The
        souls of believers are possessed of this spiritual life, of which the
        Scriptures inform us when they say that God hath ‘quickened us together
        with Christ.’ ‘Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal
        life.’ It is life, and eternal life, already possessed, and the
        commencement of that glorious life which shall be enjoyed in heaven. It
        is the blessing which the Lord commands, ‘even Life for evermore.’ This
        life, which, being borne down by so many encumbrances here, is still
        feeble, and but imperfectly enjoyed, shall, in the world to come,
        flourish in full vigor, and without any abatement. It is the life of our
        Lord and Savior, subsisting in Him, and derived from Him. In Him, His
        people shall rise and live, and live for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        He Himself hath said, ‘I am the resurrection and the life: he that
        believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever
        liveth, and believeth in Me, shall never die.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us we have a remarkable example of the accuracy with
        which the Scriptures are written. The Apostle does not say that the body
        is dead, and the spirit alive or living; or that the body is death, and
        the spirit life. Either of these would have formed the natural contrast;
        but neither would have conveyed the important sense of this passage,
        but, on the contrary, a false one. He says the body is dead, and the
        spirit is life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The body is not death, that is, in a state of everlasting death; it is
        only dead, and shall live again. On the other hand, the spirit is not
        merely said to be alive, which it might be although under sentence of
        death, afterwards to be inflicted; but it is life in the sense of that
        declaration of our Lord, ‘He that hath the Son hath life.’ The body is
        dead on account of Sin; that is, the body is not only mortal, but may,
        in some sense, be said to be already dead, being under sentence of
        death, and in constant progress towards dissolution. It remains with its
        infirmities unaltered. There is no difference between the body of the
        wicked man and the body of the believer. Every one may perceive a
        difference in their minds. The believer’s body is dead because of sin,
        according to the original sentence, ‘Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
        thou return.’ But the spirit is life — possessed of life eternal, in
        virtue of its union with Him who is ‘the life.’ Became of righteousness.
        — Here a great difficulty is removed; for it may be said, If our bodies
        are dead because of sin, how is it that our souls are life, since they
        are stained with sin, and that it is on account of their sinfulness that
        our bodies are infected with the same malady? The Apostle, in answer,
        brings into view the righteousness of Him who is in us, and shows that
        it is on account of His righteousness that our souls are life. And this
        necessarily follows; for if we have such union with our Lord and Savior,
        that we are flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones, that we are His
        members, and if He and we are one; His righteousness must be ours; for
        where there is one body, there is one righteousness. On the other hand,
        through the same union our sins have been transferred to Him, as is said
        by the Prophet Isaiah, ‘The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquities of us
        all.’ And the Apostle Peter says that He ‘bore our sins in His own body
        on the tree;’ He bore their punishment. ‘He was made sin for us who knew
        no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.’ An
        exchange, then, of sin and righteousness has taken place. By imputation
        He has been made sin, and by imputation we also are made righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, as being the surety of the new covenant, has appeared
        before God for us, and consequently His righteousness is ours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us we have an undeniable proof of the imputation to
        us of righteousness, for otherwise it would be a manifest contradiction
        to say that we die on account of our sins, and that we have life on
        account of our righteousness; for what is sin but the opposite of
        righteousness? Whoever, then, dies on account of the sin that is in him,
        cannot obtain life by his own righteousness. Now, if all men die on
        account of sin, as the Apostle here teaches, then no man can have life
        be his own righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead
        dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken
        your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here obviates a difficulty which might present itself from
        what he had said in the preceding verse, of the bodies of believers
        being dead though their souls have life. He now assures them that, if
        the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in them, God
        will also raise up their bodies, though at present mortal. Thus he sets
        before them, first, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and next their own
        resurrection, as being His members; for he deduces their resurrection
        from His resurrection. Their Head has conquered death and the grave, and
        with Him they shall overcome. Their freedom, then, from death he rests
        on the same foundation on which he had already shown that their freedom
        from sin was secured — on Jesus Christ, the surety of God’s gracious
        covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle elsewhere proves the resurrection of the bodies of
        believers, by comparing Jesus Christ with Adam, saying, ‘As in Adam all
        die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,’ 1 Corinthians 15:22;
        showing that if we do not rise by virtue of Jesus Christ our Lord,
        Christ would be inferior to Adam. For could the sin and death of Adam
        have more power to subject those who were in Him to death, than the
        righteousness and resurrection of Jesus Christ to deliver those who are
        in Him from death? The Apostle also declares that Jesus Christ, having
        risen from the dead, has become the first fruits of them that slept, and
        adds, ‘Every man in his own order; Christ the first fruits, afterwards
        the that are Christ’s at His corning.’ This he does for the purpose of
        showing that, as the first fruits of the ground precede the harvest, so
        the first fruits of the resurrection of Christ will be followed by that
        great harvest, in which the bodies of believers sown in the earth, after
        having died like grain cast into it, shall be revived and raised up. The
        life which has been communicated to our souls will, at the glorious
        resurrection, be also communicated to our bodies. All men will then
        arise, but not in glory, as all will not arise in virtue of the
        resurrection of our Lord. The wicked shall arise by the power of their
        Judge, to receive in their body the punishment of their sins, and to
        suffer ‘the second death;’ but believers, in virtue of the resurrection,
        and by the Spirit of Jesus Christ as their Head. For that Spirit which
        has been communicated to them from Jesus Christ, as from the head to the
        members, and who hath made their bodies His temples on earth, will raise
        them from the dust, and will perfect His work in them. Believers, then,
        may defy the grave, and glory over death, being assured of this
        resurrection. From the guilt of sin they have been delivered, it being
        ‘condemned’ in Christ — punished in His death; from the power of death
        they are released by His resurrection. On Jesus Christ, then, the sure
        foundation, is the whole of our salvation built.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Him God is well pleased; through Him the Holy Spirit is vouchsafed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ is the Alpha and the Omega; He is the ‘All in All.’ Quicken your
        mortal bodies. — From this it appears that, as to their substance, the
        bodies of believers will in their resurrection be the same as those that
        died. ‘Though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh
        shall I see God,’ Job 19:26. ‘Thy dead men shall live, together with my
        dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust:
        for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the
        dead,’ Isaiah 26:19. The soul of each man will be reunited to his own
        body in which he has done good or evil. For as the body is the organ of
        the soul in this world, so it must participate in the felicity or
        punishment that shall follow, whether the whole man has remained under
        the law, or has been received into the covenant of grace. But as to the
        qualities of the bodies of believers, these will be different from what
        they were here, as the Apostle teaches, 1 Corinthians 15:50. For as in
        this world they have borne the image of the first man, who was of the
        earth earthy; so, in the resurrection, when this corruptible shall put
        on in corruption, they shalt bear the image of the second man, who is
        heavenly; the bodies of their humiliation being fashioned like unto the
        glorious body of the Son of God, Philippians 3:21, not only in having a
        perfect beauty, exempt from all maladies, but as being spiritual,
        adapted to their spiritual and heavenly state. And as, when Jesus was
        transfigured, His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was white
        as light, so the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
        of their Father. From all this we may judge what will be the condition
        of the soul, and what its glory conformable to so glorious a body. We
        see also what is the death of believers, which is only a sleep, since it
        is to be followed by such a resurrection. Inasmuch as this mystery of
        the resurrection exceeds our reason, so is it clearly represented to us
        in Scripture. f40 By the Spirit that dwelleth in you. — The indwelling
        of the Holy Spirit, who communicates life to those who are habitations
        of God through Him, is here set before believers as a pledge that their
        bodies shall not remain under the power of death. This indwelling, which
        renders their resurrection certain, imports His love, His government,
        the operation of His grace, and His care to adorn and to beautify the
        temple in which He resides; and the end of it is to confer everlasting
        life, everlasting purity, and everlasting communion with Himself. It
        would be derogatory to the majesty and glory of the blessed Spirit to
        allow those bodies, in which He dwelt as His temple, to lie for ever in
        ruins in the dust. And God, who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead,
        that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
        covenant, will raise up the bodies of His people in virtue of that
        blood, which purchased not only the redemption of their souls, but also
        of their bodies, verse 23. The power and efficacy of the three glorious
        persons of the Godhead are thus brought into view as securing the
        complete re-establishment of the bodies of believers, which, though at
        present mortal, shall hereafter partake in all the glories and
        blessedness of eternal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This concurrence of the power of the Godhead in the plan of redemption,
        in which the Father provides for our salvation, the Son merits it, and
        the Holy Spirit applies it, is established in a multitude of passages of
        the Holy Scriptures. In this economy the Father occupies the place of
        the founder of the Church, the sovereign of the world, the protector and
        avenger of His laws, and the first director of the work of our
        salvation. The Son has become the Mediator between God and man, to do
        everything necessary for our redemption, while the Holy Spirit has
        assumed the office of the comforter and sanctifier of the Church. The
        first preparation for our salvation is found in what the Father has
        done, namely, in the plan which He has formed, in the election of His
        people, and His giving them to His Son; in the appointment of the
        sacrifice, in the transfer of our sins to Him who has suffered, and in
        respect to the satisfaction He has received. The second step is seen in
        what the Son has merited and effected in coming into the world, by His
        obedience, His death, and resurrection. The third discovers the Holy
        Spirit making actual application of the whole, uniting us to the Savior,
        producing in us faith and sanctification, diffusing in our hearts the
        sentiment of our peace with God in our justification, causing us to
        persevere to the end, and raising us up again, as He will do, at the
        last day. In this Divine economy the Son has received His mission from
        the Father to come into the world. On this account He so often refers
        His first advent to His being sent by the Father to take on Himself the
        office of the Prophet, the Priest, and the King of His Church. To this
        inequality of office such passages as the following ought to be
        referred: ‘— my Father is greater than I,’ John 14:28; and that in 1
        Corinthians 15:28, where it is said, ‘Then shall the Son also Himself be
        subject unto Him;’ thus terminating His mediatorial office in delivering
        up the kingdom by an act of humiliation, in the same way as He had
        entered upon it. For in neither of these texts is any personal
        inequality spoken of between the Father and Son, but an inequality of
        office according to which the Father is greater than the Son, and the
        Son inferior to the Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrection of Christ, in the passage before us, is ascribed to the
        Father and the Holy Spirit; but in other places this is also ascribed to
        the Son Himself. The Father, and the Holy Spirit, and the Son, then,
        must be one God. It is only those in whom the Spirit of God that raised
        Jesus from the dead dwells, who shall have their mortal bodies thus
        quickened, so as to rise again in glory. Christ, indeed, will also raise
        His enemies, but His own people will be made alive — which is never said
        of the wicked — to live with Him in glory for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
        live after the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a consequence drawn from what the Apostle had said with
        reference to the state of enmity against God, and of the death of those
        who are in the flesh; and likewise from what He had been showing to be
        the great privilege of believers, as being not in the flesh but in the
        Spirit; as having the Spirit of God dwelling in them; and not only
        giving life to their souls, but securing the future quickening and
        raising of their bodies. From all this he infers their obligation to
        live a holy life, in walking according to the Spirit in the character
        which he had shown belonged to them. They were not then debtors to the
        flesh — the state in which they had been by nature, which is a state of
        corruption, guilt, and weakness — to live after the flesh, either to
        expect life from its best efforts, or to obey it in its lusts. The ways
        of the flesh promise happiness, but misery is their reward. On the
        contrary, it is implied that they were debtors to God, to whom they were
        under so great obligations as being redeemed from the law of sin and
        death, to serve and obey Him, in walking according to the Spirit, in
        that new and Divine nature which He has graciously imparted to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
        through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
      </p>
      <p>
        For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. — The reason in the former
        verse why those to whom the Apostle wrote were not debtors to live after
        the flesh — under any obligation to obey its dictates — was taken from
        their obligations to God in respect of their privileges; here it is
        taken from the doom of those who thus live. If ye live agreeably to your
        carnal nature, without Christ and faith in Him, and according to the
        corrupt principles that belong to man in the state in which he is born,
        ye shall die. Ye shall suffer all the misery that throughout eternity
        shall be the portion of the wicked, which is called death, as death is
        the greatest evil in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the wrath of God is denounced against all who do not live to God,
        in obedience to His commands, but serve the lusts of the flesh, and do
        not seek salvation in the way He has appointed, however harmless and
        even useful they may be in society. At the same time, this proves that
        nothing done by the natural man, in his best efforts and highest
        attainments, will lead to God and to life. The Apostle thus repeats what
        he had affirmed in the sixth verse, that to be carnally minded is death.
        But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of this body. — The
        deeds of the body are the works which corrupt nature produces. The
        believer neither indulges nor walks according to them, but mortifies and
        puts them to death. Those to whom the Apostle wrote had mortified the
        deeds of the body, yet they are here called to a further mortification
        of them, which imports that this is both a gradual work, and to be
        continued and persevered in while we are in the world. This shows that
        the sanctification of the believer is progressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some have objected to the doctrine of progressive sanctification, and
        have conceived that to assert it is a great error. They hold that there
        is no more progress in sanctification than there is in justification,
        and that both are complete at once on believing the truth. There is just
        so much truth in this as serves to make the error plausible. It is true
        that there is a sense in which believers are perfectly sanctified from
        the moment they believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        That sanctification, however, is not in themselves; it is in Christ, as
        much as their justification. The moment they believe, they are justified
        in Christ and perfectly righteous; and the moment they believe, they are
        sanctified in Him, and in Him are perfectly holy. Viewed in Christ, they
        are ‘complete.’ But there is a personal sanctification, which commences
        with the new birth on believing the truth, and which is not perfected
        till death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many passages of Scripture import this doctrine. The following prayer of
        the Apostle is explicit and decisive: — ’And the very God of peace
        sanctify you wholly,’ 1 Thessalonians 5:23. The Apostle Peter enjoins on
        believers to desire the pure milk of the word, that they may grow
        thereby, and begins his second Epistle by praying that grace might be
        multiplied to those to whom he wrote, and concludes it by enjoining on
        them to grow in grace. ‘The path of the just is as the shining light,
        that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers obtain sanctification by the Spirit through the truth. Their
        sanctification, then, must be in proportion as the truth is understood
        and believed. It is through faith in Christ, Acts 26:18; if so,
        according to the degree of faith will be the degree of sanctification.
        But all Christians are not equal in faith, neither, then, are they equal
        in sanctification; and as a Christian advances in faith, he advances in
        sanctification. If he may say, ‘Lord, increase my faith,’ he may
        likewise say, ‘Lord, increase my sanctification.’ He receives the Holy
        Spirit only in a measure. He may and ought, therefore, to pray for a
        larger measure of influence and grace from Him who gives grace in that
        measure which pleases Him. We should pray that God would grant unto us
        according to the riches of His glory, that we may be strengthened with
        might by His Spirit in the inner man. They who have already put on
        Christ as their sanctifier, are still exhorted to put Him on, ch. 13:14
        — that is, more and more. There are babes in Christ, <460301>
        Corinthians 3:1; there are little children, and young men, and fathers,
        John 2:12. Through the Spirit. — It is through the power of the Holy
        Spirit, who testifies of Christ and His salvation, and according to the
        new nature which He communicates, that the believer mortifies his sinful
        propensities.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not then of himself, of his own power or will, that he is able to
        do this. ‘Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as
        of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.’ No man overcomes the
        corruptions of his heart but by the influence of the Spirit of God.
        Though it is the Spirit of God who enables us to mortify the deeds of
        the body, yet it is also said to be our own act. We do this through the
        Spirit. The Holy Spirit works in men according to the constitution that
        God has given them. The same work is, in one point of view, the work of
        God, and in another the work of man. Ye shall live. — Here eternal life
        is promised to all who, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the
        body. The promise of life by the Gospel is not made to the work, but to
        the worker; and to the worker, not for or on account of his work, but
        according to his work, for the sake of Christ’s work. The promise, then,
        of life is not made to the work of mortification, but to him that
        mortifies his flesh; and that not for his mortification, but because he
        is in Christ, of which this mortification is the effect and the
        evidence. That they who mortify the flesh shall live, is quite
        consistent with the truth that the gift of God is eternal life, Romans
        6:23; and in this gift there is no respect to the merit of the receiver.
        This describes the character of all who shall receive eternal life; and
        it is of great importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes away every ground of hope from those who profess to know God,
        and in works deny Him; for they that are Christ’s have crucified the
        flesh with the affections and lusts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all this we are reminded that, while we cannot in this life attain to
        the fulfilling of the law in our own persons, we must seek to be
        conformed to that law, and so mortify the old man in our members,
        otherwise it is a proof that we have no part in the righteousness of
        Christ. For can it be supposed that by Him we are absolved from sin in
        order to obtain a license to continue in sin ourselves? On the contrary,
        our justification and our sanctification, as is shown in the sixth
        chapter, are inseparable. Jesus Christ came by water and blood; not by
        water only, but by water and blood, — signifying by the blood the
        expiation of the guilt of our sins by His death, and by water the virtue
        of His Spirit for our sanctification in washing our souls from the
        pollution of sin. In like manner, under the law, there were not only
        sacrifices of animals whose blood was shed, but various washings, to
        teach us that these two benefits are inseparable in the Gospel.
        Accordingly, when David describes the blessedness of the man whose
        transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered, unto whom the Lord
        imputeth not iniquity, he immediately adds, in whose spirits there is no
        guile. For ought we to wish to receive the remission of sin, and to
        continue to walk in guile? Ought we thus to seek to divide Christ,
        receiving only the efficacy of His blood and not that of His Spirit;
        desiring that He should be made to us righteousness and not also
        sanctification? We are to seek in Him the cause of our justification,
        and observe in ourselves its proofs and effects. We should see that, as
        we are pilgrims in this world, we have for our guide the Spirit of
        sanctification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
        sons of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a proof of what had just been said, namely, that if, through the
        Spirit, those whom the Apostle addressed mortified the deeds of the
        body, they should live; for all who do so are led by the Spirit. In
        spiritual things we are as little children, who, on account of their
        weakness, have need to be led by the hand that they may not fall. It is
        necessary, then, that believers be led by the Spirit of God. The manner
        in which the Spirit leads them is not by violence against their
        inclination, but by bending and changing their will, in a manner
        consistent with its nature. When Jesus Christ says, ‘No man can come to
        Me except the Father which hath sent Me, draw Him,’ it is not meant that
        God forces against their will those whom He draws, but it shows us that
        we are naturally so indisposed to go to Jesus Christ, that it is
        necessary that God, by His Spirit, draw us to Him, and that by His
        secret but powerful influence He changes our resistance into consent.
        This is what is meant by the Church in the Song of Solomon, when she
        says, ‘Draw me, we will run after Thee;’ for this shows that she is
        drawn in such a way that she runs, that is, that her will being changed,
        and her perversity removed, she with alacrity follows the Lord. God
        gives His people to will and to do of His good pleasure, making them
        willing in the day of His power, and by His Spirit changes their hearts
        of stone into hearts of flesh. This leading of the Spirit consists, too,
        in enlightening our understandings, as Jesus Christ says, ‘When He the
        Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into all truth.’ It consists
        also in the sanctification of our will and afflictions; so that he who
        is led by the Spirit is transformed by the renewing of his mind, proving
        what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. He has the
        eyes of his understanding enlightened to know what is the hope of the
        calling of God, and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the
        saints. The Apostle shows what the Spirit leads to, when he says that
        the fruit of the Spirit is ‘love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
        gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.’ It must, however, be
        remarked that this leading of the Spirit is not such in this world as to
        exclude all imperfection. For notwithstanding that we are thus led, ‘in
        many things we all offend,’ James 3:2. We have still within us a
        principle opposing the Spirit, as it is said, ‘The flesh lusteth against
        the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the
        one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would,’
        Galatians 5:17. But he is led by the Spirit, who, though enticed by the
        flesh to walk in a contrary direction, yet resists and contends against
        it, and mortifies the deeds of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit thus leads those in whom He dwells to the mortification
        of sin. He takes of the glory of the person of Jesus, as God manifest in
        the flesh, and of His office, as the one Mediator between God and man,
        and discovers it to His people. Convincing them of their sinful
        condition, and of Christ’s righteousness, He leads them to renounce
        everything of their own, in the hope of acceptance with God. He teaches
        them as the Spirit of truth shining upon His own word, striving with
        ‘them by it externally, and internally by His grace conducting, guiding,
        and bringing them onwards in the way of duty, and, as the promised
        Comforter, filling them with Divine consolation. Thus He leads them to
        Christ, to prayer as the spirit of grace and of supplication, to
        holiness, and to happiness. This shows us the cause why the children of
        God, notwithstanding their remaining ignorance and depravity, and the
        many temptations with which they are assailed, hold on in the way of the
        Lord. ‘Lead me in Thy truth, and teach me, for Thou art the God of my
        salvation; on Thee do I wait all the day.’ ‘Thy Spirit is good, lead me
        into the land of uprightness.’ This leading is enjoyed by none but
        Christians; for ‘as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
        sons of God.’ The sons of God. — The Scriptures give this character of
        sons of God differently, according as it is ascribed either by nature or
        by peace. By nature it belongs to Jesus Christ alone, and that in
        respect to His Divine nature, so that He is called the only-begotten Son
        of God. By grace there are others who are called the sons of God. The
        grace of the conception by the Holy Spirit, and of the personal union of
        the Divine nature which belongs to Jesus Christ as man, is a particular
        grace, He having been conceived by the Holy Ghost, and His human nature
        has been joined to His Divine nature, forming one person; and it is of
        this grace that the angel speaks in announcing His birth, Luke 1:35.
        There is also a grace more general, which is that of creation, by which
        the angels are called the sons of God, and from this grace those of them
        who sinned have fallen. Finally, there is the grace of redemption,
        according to which men are called, as in this place, the sons of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        As among men there are two ways of becoming children, the one by birth,
        the other by adoption, so God hath also appointed that in these two ways
        His people should become His children. Adoption supplied among men the
        want of children by birth, and no one could be a son except by one of
        these titles; but God has been pleased that we should be His sons by
        both of them together. Here and in the following verses the Apostle
        exhibits four proofs of our being the sons of God. The first is our
        being led by the Spirit of God; the second is the Spirit of adoption
        which we receive, crying, ‘Abba, Father,’ verse 15; the third is the
        witness of the Spirit with our spirits, verse 16; the fourth is our
        sufferings in the communion of Jesus Christ; to which is joined the
        fruit of our sonship, the Apostle saying that if children we are heirs
        of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him,
        that we may be also glorified together.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this title of the sons of God, the doubts and servile fears of the
        Church of Rome are condemned, which teaches that believers should be
        uncertain respecting their salvation and the love of God. But ought they
        to doubt of the love of their Heavenly Father? The Scriptures teach them
        to call God their Father, but, according to that apostate church, they
        ought to be uncertain whether they are the children of God or the
        children of the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
        This error the Apostle combats in the followings verse. The title, then,
        of sons of God is full of consolation; for we thus approach to God as
        our father, and have access with boldness to His throne of grace. Even
        in our afflictions we lift up our eyes to Him, not as a severe master,
        but a gracious Father; and we know that our afflictions are only
        chastisements and trials from His paternal love, which He employs for
        our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — For ye have not received, the spirit of bondage again to
        fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba
        Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is of the greatest importance to believers to be assured that they
        are indeed the sons of God. Without a measure of this assurance they
        cannot serve Him with love in newness of spirit. The Apostle therefore
        enlarges here on his preceding declaration, that as many as are led by
        the Spirit of God are the sons of God. In confirmation of this, he
        reminds those whom he addresses that they had not received the spirit of
        bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of adoption, leading them to call
        on God as their Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word spirit occurs twice in this verse. In this chapter, as has
        already been remarked, it is used in various senses. Sometimes it is
        taken in Scripture in a bad sense, as when it is said, Isaiah 19:14,
        ‘The Lord hath, mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof;’ and
        again, Isaiah 29:10, ‘For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit
        of deep sleep.’ In the verse before us it is taken both in a bad sense,
        signifying a sinful affection of the mind, namely, the spirit of
        bondage, and in a good sense, signifying by the Spirit of adoption the
        Holy Spirit, as in the parallel passage, Galatians 4:6, ‘And because ye
        are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,
        crying, Abba, Father.’ The spirit of bondage. — All who are not dead to
        the law, and know of no way to escape Divine wrath but by obeying it,
        must be under the spirit of bondage; serving in the oldness of the
        letter, and not in newness of spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        For so far from fulfilling the demands of the law, they fail in
        satisfying themselves. A spirit of bondage, then, must belong to all who
        are not acquainted with God’s method of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spirit of bondage is the effect of the law, which, manifesting his
        sinfulness to man, and the fearful wrath of God, makes him tremble under
        the apprehension of its curse. The Apostle, comparing the two covenants,
        namely the law from Mount Sinai, and the Gospel from Mount Zion, says
        that the one from Mount Sinai gendereth to bondage, which is Hagar, but
        Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of all believers;
        because, like Isaac, they are the children of the promise. Now this
        promise is the promise of grace. For as man has sinned, the law, which
        demands perfect obedience, and pronounces a curse against him who
        continues not in all things which it commands, must condemn and reduce
        him to the condition of a slave, who, after he transgresses, expects
        nothing but punishment. On this account, when God promulgated His law
        amidst thunderings and lightnings, the mountain trembled, and the people
        feared and stood afar off. This showed that man could only tremble under
        the law, as he could not be justified by it; but that he must have
        recourse to another covenant, namely, the covenant of grace, in which
        God manifests His mercy and His love, in which He presents to sinners
        the remission of their sins, and the righteousness of His well beloved
        Son; for in this covenant He justifies the ungodly, Romans 4:5, and
        imputes to them righteousness without works. He adopts as His own
        children those who were formerly children of wrath, and gives the Spirit
        of adoption to them who had before a spirit of bondage and servile fear.
        Again to fear. — Paul uses the word again to indicate a double
        opposition, — the one of the state of a man before and after his
        regeneration, the other of the New Testament and the Old. Before
        regeneration, a man, sensible that he is a sinner, must be apprehensive
        of punishment, not having embraced the only remedy provided for the
        remission of his sins by Jesus Christ. Not that it should be supposed
        that this is the case with all unregenerate men, or at all times, but
        only when their consciences are awakened, summoning them before the
        judgment-seat of God. For the greater part of them live in profane
        security, with hardened consciences, and without any apprehension of
        their ruined state. God, however, often impresses that fear on those
        whom He purposes to lead to the knowledge of His salvation. But when
        they are born of the Spirit, this servile fear gives place to a filial
        fear which proceeds from love, as the proper effect of the Spirit of
        adoption. ‘Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
        the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear; because
        fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The other opposition which the Apostle marks in saying again, is between
        the Churches of the Old and of the New Testament. Not that the believers
        under the Old Testament had not the Spirit of adoption; for they were
        sanctified by the Spirit of God, and had fellowship with Jesus Christ
        the promised Messiah, being justified by faith, as is declared in the
        eleventh chapter of the Hebrews, and called God their Father, Isaiah
        63:16. But the Church under the Old Testament, being still in its
        infancy, did not enjoy the Spirit of adoption in that abundance, nor had
        it so clear a revelation of grace, as that of the New. Believers only
        saw Christ at a distance under shadows and figures, while the law and
        its curses were strongly exhibited. Thus, in comparison of the New
        Testament and its freedom, they were, in a measure, held under bondage,
        Galatians 4:1-3.
      </p>
      <p>
        The believers at Rome, then, whether originally Jews or Gentiles, had
        not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. They were not come
        unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, or to
        the law, the work of which is written in the hearts of all men, which
        speaks nothing of mercy; but they were come to Mount Zion. It was the
        design of Christ’s advent that believers in Him might serve God ‘without
        fear,’ Luke 1:74.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ came that through death He might destroy death, and him
        that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and to deliver them
        who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage,
        Hebrews 2:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the movements excited by the spirit of bondage are only those of a
        slave, — selfish and mercenary motives of desire, hope of what will give
        them happiness, and fear of evil, but no movement of love either of God
        or holiness, or of hatred of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage before us, and many others, as that of 2 Timothy 1:7, — ’God
        hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of
        a sound mind,’ — teaches us that servile fear ought to be banished from
        the minds of believers. This fear is a fear of distrust, and not that
        fear to which we are enjoined in various parts of Scripture, namely, a
        reverential fear of God impressed by a sense of His majesty, which is
        the beginning of wisdom, and which His children should at all times
        cherish. This fear is connected with the consolations of the Holy Ghost.
        ‘Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and
        Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in
        the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.’ There is also a
        salutary fear which ought always to be maintained in the hearts of
        Christians; for the assurance of his salvation, which a believer ought
        to cherish, is not a profane assurance which prompts him to disregard
        the authority of God, but leads to a diligent carefulness to conform to
        His word, and make use of the means for edification of His appointment.
        This is what the Apostle intends when he says, ‘Work out your own
        salvation with fear and trembling;’ for God designs to banish from our
        hearts a carnal security, as appears when it is added, ‘for it is God
        which worketh in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure,’
        showing that it is God who produces in His people both the will and the
        performance. This fear is required from the consideration of our
        weakness, our propensity to evil, and the many spiritual enemies with
        whom we are surrounded; and for the purpose of making us careful that we
        do not fall; while we ought not to doubt of the love of our Heavenly
        Father, but, considering the infallible promises of our God, and the
        intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ, we should hold fast the assurance
        of our salvation. The Apostle Peter enjoins on those whom he addressed
        as elect unto obedience, through the foreknowledge of God, as loving
        Jesus Christ, and as rejoicing in Him with joy unspeakable and full of
        glory, to pass the time of their sojourning here in fear, because they
        had been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ. This consideration
        shows how horrible and dangerous is the nature of sin which works in our
        members. This fear implanted in the hearts of the children of God tends
        to their preservation in the midst of dangers, as that instinctive fear
        which exists in all men operates to the preservation of natural life,
        and is entirely consistent with the fullest confidence in God, with
        love, and the joyful hope of eternal glory. If, however, the fear of
        man, or of any evil from the world, deter believers from doing their
        duty to God, it arises from the remains of carnal and unmortified fear.
        But nothing is more unworthy of the Gospel, or more contrary to its
        spirit, which, in proportion as it is believed, begets love, and
        communicates joy, peace, and consolation, in every situation in which we
        are placed. But ye have received the Spirit of adoption. — The Holy
        Spirit is called the Spirit of adoption, either as the cause by which
        God makes us His children, or as the earnest and seal of our adoption.
        Contrary to the spirit of bondage, the Spirit of adoption produces in
        the heart a sense of reconciliation with God, love to Him, a regard to
        holiness, hatred of sin, and peace of conscience through the knowledge
        of the love of God in Jesus Christ. It begets a desire to glorify God
        here on earth, and to enjoy the glory of heaven hereafter. Formerly, in
        their unregenerate state, those to whom Paul wrote had the spirit of
        slaves, now they had the spirit of sons. Adoption is not a work of grace
        in us, but an act of God’s grace without us.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the original word, it signifies putting among children. It
        is taking those who were by nature children of wrath from the family of
        Satan, to which they originally belonged, into the family of God. By
        union with Jesus Christ, being joined with Him, we are one body, and we
        enter into the communion of His righteousness, and of His title as the
        Son of God, so that, as we are righteous in Him, we are also in Him, as
        His members, the sons of God, who, in the moment that the Holy Spirit
        unites us to Jesus Christ, receives us as His children. All this shows
        us how great is the benefit which we obtain when we receive the Spirit
        of adoption and communion with the Son of God. We are thus made children
        of God, the sons of the Father of lights — a title permanent, and a
        nature immortal and Divine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our adoption reminds us of our original state as children of wrath and
        rebellion, and strangers to the covenant of God. It discovers to us the
        honor to which God has called us, in becoming our Father and making us
        His children, — including so many advantages, rights, and privileges,
        and at the same time imposing on us so many duties. These may be
        comprised under four heads. The first regards the privilege and glory of
        having God for our Father, and being His children. The second includes
        the rights which this adoption confers, as of free access to God, the
        knowledge of His ways, and the assurance of His protection. The third
        implies God’s love for us, His jealousy for our interest, and His care
        to defend us. The fourth, all the duties which the title or relation of
        children engages us to perform towards our Father and our God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term adoption is borrowed from the ancient custom, especially
        prevalent among the Romans, of a man who had no children of his own
        adopting into his family the child of another. The father and the
        adopted child appeared before the praetor, when the adopting father said
        to the child, Wilt thou be my son ? and the child answered, I will. The
        allusion to this custom reminds believers that they are not the children
        of God otherwise than by His free and voluntary election, and that thus
        they are under far more powerful obligations to serve Him than are their
        own children to obey them, since it is entirely by His love and free
        good pleasure that they have been elevated to this dignity. We should
        also remark the difference between the adoption of man and the adoption
        of God. In choosing a son by adoption, the adopting party has regard to
        certain real or supposed qualities which appear meritorious or
        agreeable; but God, in adopting His people, Himself produces the
        qualities in those whom He thus chooses. Man can impart his goods and
        give his name to those whom he adopts, but he cannot change their
        descent, nor transfer them into his own image; but God renders those
        whom He adopts not only partakers of His name and of His blessings, but
        of His nature itself, charging and transforming them into His own
        blessed resemblance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This adoption, then, is accompanied with a real change, and so great a
        change, that it bears the name of that which is the real ground of
        sonship, and is called regeneration. And these are inseparable. There
        are no sons of God by adoption, but such as are also His sons by
        regeneration. There is a new life breathed into them by God. He is not
        only the Father of their spirits by their first infusion into the body,
        enlivening it by them, but by this new infusion of grace into their
        souls, which were dead without it; and the Spirit of God renewing them
        is the Spirit of adoption, by which they cry, ‘Abba, Father.’ He gives
        them a supernatural life by His Spirit sent into their hearts; and the
        Spirit by that regeneration which He works, ascertains to them that
        adoption which is in Christ Jesus; and in the persuasion of both they
        call God their Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this manner, after adoption comes our sonship by regeneration, not in
        the order of time, but of nature; for, being united to Christ, God forms
        in us His image, and this is the second way in which we are made the
        children of God. Regeneration, or this new birth, is not a figurative
        but a real change. ‘If any man be in Christ he is a new creature,’ or a
        new creation, 2 Corinthians 5:17; for when we are regenerated, we are
        created in Christ Jesus, Ephesians 2:10. Nor is it a reformation of
        character, but the renewal of the image of God in the soul, which had
        been totally effaced. They who are born again, are begotten in Christ
        Jesus through the Gospel, being born not of corruptible seed, but of
        incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
        Thus they are ‘born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
        the will of man, but of God.’ For this new birth the man can do nothing
        to prepare himself. Neither after he is renewed can he effect anything
        to ensure his perseverance in his new state. The Spirit of God alone
        both renews and preserves those who are renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this regeneration we obtain qualities which are analogous to the
        nature of God. He enlightens our understanding, sanctifies our will,
        purifies our affections, and, by the communication of those qualities
        which have a relation to His Divine nature, begets us in His image and
        likeness, which is the new man of which Paul speaks, Ephesians 4:23,24;
        Colossians 3:10; and, as the Apostle Peter declares, we are made
        ‘partakers of the Divine nature.’ The fall of Adam has not deprived man
        of his subsistence or of his faculties, but has introduced into his
        understanding the darkness of ignorance, with malice and evil into his
        will, and disorder in his affections; so that, before his adoption and
        regeneration, he is by these vicious qualities the child of Satan, whose
        image he bears. The opposite of all this is that spiritual regeneration
        by means of which he is the child of God, consisting in the
        re-establishment of the uprightness of his faculties, and the abolition
        of those vicious qualities which have been introduced by sin. God begets
        us by His Spirit and by His word, James 1:18; and on His sons, thus
        formed, He bestows two graces, — the one is their justification, and the
        other their sanctification. By the first, they are invested with the
        righteousness of Jesus Christ, which is imputed to them; and this is the
        principal part of their spiritual and supernatural life, which is hid in
        Jesus Christ, Colossians 3:3. By the second, the Holy Spirit operates in
        them, to quicken and make them walk in newness of life. And as this last
        grace is not perfect in this world, but still leaves many faults and
        imperfections, although they are the children of God, there are still in
        them remains of the old man, and of the image of Satan. In this sense
        they have more or less the character of children of God, as they advance
        more or less in sanctification; and to this advancement they are
        continually urged by the exhortations of the word of God. The adoption
        of God’s people, and their regeneration, are both declared, John
        1:12,13.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adoption confers the name of sons, and a title to the inheritance;
        regeneration confers the nature of sons, and a meetness for the
        inheritance. Abba, Father. — The interpretation which is generally given
        of this expression is, that Paul employs these two words — Syriac and
        Greek, the one taken from the language in use among the Jews, the other
        from that of the Gentiles — to show that there is no longer any
        distinction between the Jew and the Greek, and that all believers, in
        every nation, may address God as their Father in their own language. It
        would rather appear that the Apostle alludes to the fact that among the
        Jews slaves were not allowed to call a free man Abba, which signified a
        real father. ‘I cannot help remarking’ (says Claude in his Essay on the
        Composition of a Sermon) ‘the ignorance of Messieurs of Port-Royal, who
        have translated this passage, My Father, instead of Abba, Father, under
        pretense that the Syriac word Abba signifies Father. They did not know
        that St. Paul alluded to a law among the Jews which forbade slaves to
        call a free man Abba, or a free woman Imma. The Apostle meant that we
        were no more slaves, but freed by Jesus Christ; and consequently that we
        might call God Abba, as we call the Church Imma. In translating the
        passage, then, the word Abba, although it be a Syriac word, and unknown
        in our tongue, must always be preserved, for in this term consists the
        force of the Apostle’s reasoning.’
      </p>
      <p>
        God is indeed our Father, as the Author of our being, beyond all visible
        creatures, as it is said, ‘We are also His offspring,’ Acts 17:28. But
        the privilege of this our natural relation, the sin of our nature hath
        made fruitless to us, till we be restored by grace, and made partakers
        of a new sonship. We are indeed the workmanship of God; but, it being
        defaced by sin, our true name, as considered in that state, is ‘children
        of wrath.’ But the sonship that emboldens us to draw near unto God as
        our Father is derived from His only-begotten Son. He became the Son of
        man to make us anew the sons of God. Being thus restored, we may indeed
        look back upon; our creation, and remember in prayer that we are His
        creatures, the workmanship of His hands, and He in that sense our
        Father; but by reason of our rebellion this argument is not strong
        enough alone, but must be supported with this other, as the main ground
        of our comfort, and that wherein the strength of our confidence lies,
        that He is our Father in His Son Jesus Christ; that by faith we are
        introduced into a new sonship, and by virtue of that may call Him
        Father, and move Him by that name to help and answer us. ‘To as many as
        received Him, He gave power to become the sons of God,’ John 1:12. But
        adoption holds in Jesus Christ, as the Head of this fraternity;
        therefore He says, ‘I go to My Father, and your Father; to holy God, and
        your God.’ He does not say, ‘to our Father and our God,’ but severally
        mine and yours; teaching us the order of the new covenant, that the
        sonship of Jesus Christ is not only more eminent in nature, but in order
        is the spring and cause of ours. So, then, He that puts this word in our
        mouths, to call God ‘Father,’ He it is by whom we have this dignity and
        comfort that we call Him so. Whereby we cry. — The Spirit of adoption,
        which, enabling those who receive this Spirit to address God as their
        Father, gives filial dispositions and filial confidence. ‘Because ye are
        sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,
        crying, Abba, Father,’ Galatians 4:6. It is by the Spirit of God that we
        cry unto Him, according to what is said afterwards, that the Spirit
        ‘helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we
        ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings
        which cannot be uttered.’ This teaches us that it is not our own
        disposition that excites us to prayer, but the Spirit of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly we are commanded to pray ‘always with all prayer and
        supplication in the Spirit,’ Ephesians 6:18; and to build up ‘ourselves
        on our most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,’ Jude 20. He is
        called ‘the Spirit of grace and of supplications,’ Zechariah 12:10, to
        teach us that prayer, being His work, and not an effort of our own
        strength, we are to ask of God His Spirit to enable us to pray. This is
        the source of our consolation, that since our prayers are effects of His
        own Spirit within us, they are pleasing to God. ‘He that searcheth the
        hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because He maketh
        intercession for the saints according to the will of God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit, as the Spirit of adoption, also influences the prayers
        of believers as to their manner and earnestness, for by Him they not
        only say, but cry, ‘Abba, Father.’ They not only speak, but groan, for
        they cry not so much with the mouth as with the heart. By the term ‘we
        cry’ is also intimated the assurance of faith with which we ought to
        draw near to God. This expression signifies that we address God with
        earnestness and confidence; and that, having full reliance on His
        promises, which He hath confirmed even with an oath, we should ‘come
        boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
        grace to help in time of need.’
      </p>
      <p>
        We are also commanded to ask in faith, nothing wavering, for we come
        before the throne of God by His beloved Son. We appear as His members,
        in virtue of His blood, by which our sins, which would hinder our
        prayers from being heard, are expiated, so that God has no more
        remembrance of them. It is on this ground that we pray with assurance,
        for, as we cannot pray to God as our Father, but by His Son, so we
        cannot cry, ‘Abba, Father,’ but by Him; and on this account Jesus says,
        ‘I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the
        Father but by Me.’ Thus the consideration that we invoke God as our
        Father forms in believers a holy assurance, for, as a father pitieth his
        children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him. Since, then, we call
        God our Father, as our Lord teaches us to address Him, we should do it
        with the assurance of His love, and of His readiness to hear us. ‘Thou
        shalt call Me, My Father; and shalt not turn away from Me,’ Jeremiah
        3:19.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word Father also indicates the substance of our prayers; for when we
        can say no more to God than ‘O God, Thou art our Father,’ we say all,
        and comprehend in this all that we can ask; as the Church said in its
        captivity, ‘Doubtless Thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of
        us.’ Thus, in whatever situation the believer finds himself, the crying,
        ‘Abba, Father,’ contains an appeal sufficient to move the compassion of
        God. Is he in want? he says, ‘Abba, Father,’ as if he said, ‘O Lord,
        Thou feedest the ravens, provide for Thy son.’ Is he in danger? it is as
        if he said, ‘Have the same care of me as a father has for his child, and
        let not Thy compassion and Thy providence abandon me.’ Is he on the bed
        of death? it is as if he said, ‘Since thou art my Father, into Thy hands
        I commend my spirit.’ All acceptable prayer must proceed from the Spirit
        of adoption; and the cry of the Spirit of adoption is no other than
        Ababa, Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crying ‘Abba, Father,’ then, denotes the earnestness and importunity
        in prayer to God, which is the effect of the Spirit of adoption in the
        hearts of the children of God, as well as that holy familiarity, to the
        exercise of which, as viewing God sitting on a throne of grace, they are
        encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        They call upon God as their Father, after the example of our Lord, who
        at all times addressed God in this manner during His ministry on earth,
        with that one memorable exception, when, under the pressure of the sins
        of His people, and the withdrawing of the light of His countenance, He
        addressed Him not as His Father but His God, Matthew 27:46. After His
        resurrection, in like manner, He comforted His disciples with the
        consolatory assurance that He was about to ascend to His Father and
        their Father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The different expressions which the Scriptures employ to denote the
        filial relation of His people to God, are calculated to aid their
        conceptions, and to elevate their thoughts to that great and ineffable
        blessing. One mode of expression serves to supply what is wanting in
        another. The origin of the spiritual life, and the re-establishment of
        the image of God in the soul, are expressed by these words — born of
        God. But that they may not forget the state of their natural alienation
        from God, and ill order to indicate their title to the heavenly
        inheritance, it is said that they are adopted by God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lest they should suppose that this adoption is to be attributed to
        anything meritorious in them, they are informed that God has
        predestinated them unto the adoption of children, by Jesus Christ, to
        Himself, accordingly to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of
        the glory of His grave, Ephesians 1:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage before us is conclusive against the doctrine of the Church
        of Rome, which maintains that the believer ought to be always in fear of
        condemnation, always in doubt of the love of God, and of his salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But is not this expressly to contradict the words of the Apostle? It
        should be remarked that they cannot plead here the exception that it was
        a prerogative peculiar to the Apostle, to be assured of his salvation,
        by a special revelation that had been made to him. For he speaks
        expressly to believers, ‘Ye have received the Spirit of adoption,’ and
        next he speaks of them with himself, when he says, ‘whereby we cry,
        Abba, Father.’ This assurance of the believer is clearly taught in many
        other places. The Apostle, after saying, Romans 5:1, ‘Being justified by
        faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ,’ adds, ‘By
        whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and
        rejoice in hope of the glory of God,’ — expressing by the word rejoice
        (literally boast) a full assurance; for it would be rashness to boast or
        glory (as the same word is translated in the following verse) in what
        was not a real certainty. He also declares that hope maketh not ashamed;
        and that we even glory in tribulations, as assured that they cannot
        deprive us of the love of God. ‘We have boldness, too, and access with
        confidence,’ by the faith we have in Jesus Christ, Ephesians 3:12. ‘Let
        us, therefore’ (seeing that we have a great High Priest, that is passed
        into the heavens), ‘come boldly unto the throne of grace,’ Hebrews
        4:14-16. And why is the Spirit which is given to believers called the
        seal and earnest of their inheritance, if it is not to give them this
        assurance? Why, also, are the declarations so express, that there is no
        condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, and that whosoever
        believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life? The Apostle
        John says, ‘These things have I written unto you that believe on the
        name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life,’ —
        thus showing that he desires that all who believe should know that they
        have eternal life. The reply of the Roman Catholics, that we cannot know
        assuredly if we have faith, is altogether vain. Paul proves the
        contrary, when he says, ‘Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith;
        prove your own selves; know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ
        is in you, except ye be reprobates?’ 2 Corinthians 13:5. This proves
        that believers may recognize their own faith. Faith combats doubts, as
        the Apostle James shows when he says, ‘Let him ask in faith, nothing
        wavering; for he that watereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the
        wind and tossed.’
      </p>
      <p>
        And speaking of Abraham, Paul says, ‘He staggered not at the promise of
        God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Believing, then, His promises, and drawing near in the full assurance of
        faith, gives glory to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        But doe’s faith, then, exclude all uncertainty of salvation, and has the
        believer no misgivings after he has received the Spirit of adoption? It
        is replied, that as faith is more or less perfect, there is more or less
        uncertainty or doubt connected with it, for doubts are owing to the
        weakness or to the want of faith. Faith, as viewed in itself, is one
        thing, and another as viewed in an imperfect subject. Faith in itself
        excludes all doubts and misgivings; but, because our sanctification is
        incomplete in this world, and as there is always in us the remains of
        the old man and of the flesh, which is the source of doubts, faith has
        always to combat within us, and to resist the servile fear of distrust,
        arising from the remains of our corruption. The believer, therefore,
        need not wonder though he should sometimes find himself agitated and
        troubled with doubts; on which account he should, indeed, be humbled,
        but not discouraged, for in the end faith will again raise up itself
        from under the burden of temptation, and comfort him. The Spirit of
        adoption is sometimes as if it was extinguished in us; but in the end it
        exerts its force in our hearts, so that we cry, ‘Abba, Father,’ and say
        with David, ‘Make me to have joy and gladness, that the bones which Thou
        hast broken may rejoice.’ The language of the Spirit of adoption is,
        ‘Lord, Thou art my Father, make the light of Thy countenance to shine
        upon me; cause Thy peace to reign in my conscience; expel all doubts,
        scatter the clouds which prevent me from seeing clearly the light of Thy
        face, and which hinder the Sun of Righteousness from shining in my
        heart.’ ‘Say Thou to my soul, I am Thy salvation,’ Psalm 35:3. ‘O my
        soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord,’ Psalm 16:2. And
        God says, Hosea 2:23, ‘I will say to them which were not My people, Thou
        art My people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.’ That is, ‘I will
        speak within the believer by My Spirit; I will assure him of My grace,
        and of My love; and he also shall lift up his heart to Me, and call Me
        his Father and his God.’ All this teaches us that the conscience,
        sprinkled with the blood of the Son of God, does not accuse or condemn,
        but consoles and comforts; for we have, by means of the Spirit that is
        given us, the earnest of our final deliverance. This proves how precious
        the promise of the Spirit should be to us, in order that we may not
        grieve Him by giving way to sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
        are the children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse it is said, ‘Ye have received the Spirit of
        adoption;’ here it is added, ‘The Spirit itself’ — the same Spirit —
        ’beareth witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God.’ In this
        verse the Apostle shows that the sons of God may be assured of their
        adoption, because it is witnessed by the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit,
        in the heart of a believer, joins His testimony with his spirit, in
        confirmation of this truth, that he is a son of God. It is not merely
        the fruits of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers which afford
        this testimony, but the Spirit Himself, by imparting filial confidence,
        inspires it in the heart. This is a testimony which is designed for the
        satisfaction of believers themselves, and cannot be submitted to the
        scrutiny of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The witnesses here spoken of are two, — our spirit, and the Spirit of
        God together with our spirit. We have the testimony of our spirit when
        we are convinced of our sinfulness, misery, and ruin, and of our utter
        inability to relieve ourselves from the curse of the broken law, and are
        at the same time convinced of the righteousness of Christ, and of our
        dependence upon Him for acceptance with God. We have this testimony when
        we possess the consciousness of cordially acquiescing in God’s plan of
        salvation, and of putting our trust in Christ; and when we are convinced
        that His blood is sufficient to cleanse us from all sin, and know that
        we are willing to rest on it; and when in this way, and in this way
        alone, we draw near to gods with a true heart, sprinkled from an evil
        conscience in the discernment of the efficacy of His atonement, thus
        having the answer of a good conscience towards God. And we have the
        above testimony confirmed to us when we experience and observe the
        effects of the renovation of our souls in the work of sanctification
        begun and carrying on in us; and that not with fleshly wisdom, but by
        the grace of God, we have our conversation in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all this the Holy Spirit enables us to ascertain our sonship, from
        being conscious of, and discovering in ourselves, the true marks of a
        renewed state. But to say that this is all that is signified by the Holy
        Spirits testimony, would be falling short of what is affirmed in this
        text; for in that case the Holy Spirit would only help the conscience to
        be a witness, but could not be said to be a witness Himself, even
        another witness besides the conscience, which the text asserts. What we
        learn, therefore, from it is, that the Holy Spirit testifies to our
        spirit in a distinct and immediate testimony, and also with our spirit
        in a concurrent testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
        This testimony, although it cannot be explained, is nevertheless felt by
        the believer; it is felt by him, too, in its variations, as sometimes
        stronger and more palpable, and at other times more feeble and less
        discernible. As the heart knoweth its own bitterness, in like manner a
        stranger intermeddles not with the joy communicated by this secret
        testimony to our spirit. Its reality is indicated in Scripture by such
        expressions as those of the Father and the Son coming unto us, and
        making their abode with us, — Christ manifesting Himself to us, and
        stepping with us, — His giving us the hidden manna, and the white stone,
        denoting the communication to us of the knowledge of an acquittal from
        guilt, and a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
        receiveth it. ‘The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
        Ghost, which is given unto us.’ ‘He that believeth on the Son of God
        hath the witness in himself,’ 1 John 5:10.
      </p>
      <p>
        This witnessing of the Spirit to the believer’s spirit, communicating
        consolation, is never His first work, but is consequent on His other
        work of renovation. He first gives faith, and then seals. ‘After that ye
        believed ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.’ He also
        witnesseth with our spirit, graciously shining on His own promises,
        making them clear, assuring us of their truth, enabling our spirit to
        embrace them and to discover our interest in them. He witnesseth with
        our spirit in all the blessedness of. His gracious fruits, diffusing
        through the soul love, and joy, and peace. In the first method of His
        witnessing with our spirit we are passive; but in the last method there
        is a concurrence on our part with His testimony. The testimony of the
        Spirit, then, is attended with the testimony of conscience, and is thus
        a co-witness with our spirit. It may also be observed, that where this
        exists, it brings with it a disposition and promptitude for prayer. It
        is the testimony of the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, ‘Abba,
        Father;’ it disposes the soul to holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important truth here affirmed, that the Holy Spirit beareth witness
        with our spirit, does not seduce believers from the written word, or
        expose them to delusions, mistaken for internal revelations, differing
        from the revelations of Scripture. This internal revelation must be
        agreeable to Scripture revelation, and is no revelation of a new article
        of faith unknown to Scripture. It is the revelation of a truth consonant
        to the word of God, and made to a believer in that blessed book for his
        comfort. The Spirit testifies to our sonship by an external revelation
        in the Scriptures that believers are the sons of God. He concurs with
        this testimony by illuminating the mind and understanding, and
        persuading it of the truth of this external revelation. He unites with
        this testimony by reason of His gracious sanctifying presence in us, and
        is therefore called the earnest of our inheritance, and God’s seal,
        marking us as His own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs
        with Christ: if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also,
        glorified together.
      </p>
      <p>
        If children, then heirs. — The Apostle, having proved the adoption of
        believers from the confirmation of the double and concurrent testimony
        of their own spirit and of the Spirit of God, here infers from it the
        certainty of their possessing the eternal inheritance. The fact of their
        being heirs he deduces from their being children. In this world children
        are, in all nations, heirs of their parents’ possessions. This is the
        law of nature. As such, it not only illustrates but confirms the fact
        that believers are heirs as being children. By the declaration that they
        are heirs, we are reminded that it is not by purchase, or by any work of
        their own, that they obtain the inheritance to which they are
        predestinated, Ephesians 1:11, and begotten, 1 Peter 1:3. It is solely
        in virtue of their sonship. The inheritance, which is a kingdom, was
        provided for them from the foundation of the world, Matthew 25:34,
        before they existed; and as inheritances were under the law inalienable,
        so this inheritance is eternal.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are heirs according to the promise, Galatians 3:29; heirs of
        promise, Hebrews 6:17, — that is, of all the blessings contained in the
        promise of God, which He confirmed by an oath; heirs of salvation,
        Hebrews 1:14; heirs of the grace of life, 1 Peter 3:7; heirs according
        to the hope of eternal life, Titus 3:7; heirs of righteousness, Hebrews
        11:7; heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised, James 2:5. All
        things are theirs: for they are Christ’s and Christ is God’s,
        Corinthians 3:23. Heirs of God. — Here, in one word, the Apostle states
        what is the inheritance of those who are the children of God. It is God
        Himself. ‘If a son, then an heir of God through Christ,’ Galatians 4:7.
        This expression, ‘heirs of God,’ has a manifest relation to the title of
        ‘son,’ which is acquired by adoption, on which account the Apostle here
        joins them together. This teaches that believers have not only a right
        to the good things of God, but that they have this right by their
        adoption, and not by merit. As the birthright of a child confers a title
        to the property of its father, and so distinguishes such property from
        what the child may acquire by industry and labor, so also is the case
        with adoption. Here we see the difference between the law and the
        Gospel. The law treats men as mercenaries, and says, Do, and live; the
        Gospel treats them as children, and says, Live, and do. God is the
        portion of His people; and in Him, who is ‘the possessor of heaven and’
        earth, they are heirs of all things. ‘He that overcometh shall inherit
        all things: and I will be his God, and he shall be My son,’ Revelation
        21:7. God is all sufficient; and this is an all-sufficient inheritance.
        God is eternal and unchangeable; and therefore it is an eternal
        inheritance, — an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth
        not away. They cannot be dispossessed of it, for the omnipotence of God
        secures against all opposition. It is reserved for them in heaven, which
        is the throne of God, and where He manifests His glory. It is God
        Himself, then, who is the inheritance of His children. This shows that
        He communicates Himself to them by His grace, His light, His holiness,
        His life. They possess God as their inheritance in two degrees, namely,
        in possessing in this life His grace, and in the life to come His glory.
        ‘Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me to
        glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I
        desire besides Thee!’ Psalm 73:24. And what is the inheritance in glory,
        if it be not God, who is all in all! Here we have the life of grace,
        ‘The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
        communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.’ In the life to come, it
        is the enjoyment or the vision of God which, in the seventeenth Psalm,
        the Prophet opposes to the inheritance of the men of this world, —
        ’Deliver me, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in
        this life. As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall
        be satisfied when I awake with Thy likeness.’ Into this inheritance
        Moses — that is to say, the law — cannot introduce us. He alone can do
        it who is the great Joshua — Jesus Christ, the Mediator of a better
        covenant. Joint heirs with Christ. — This, with the expression ‘heirs of
        God,’ shows the glorious nature of the inheritance of the children of
        God. What must this honor be when they are heirs of God, and joint heirs
        with Christ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam was a son of God; the lordship of paradise was given him, but he
        lost it. Satan and his angels were also sons of God by creation, and
        they fell. But the joint heirs of Christ can never fall. They have their
        inheritance secured by their union with Christ, and hold it by a title
        which is indefeasible, and a right which never can be revoked. Christ is
        the heir, as being the Son of God. All things that the Father hath are
        His; and, as Mediator, He is appointed ‘heir of all things,’ and they
        are joint heirs with Him. The inheritance to be possessed by them is the
        same in its nature as that possessed by the man Christ Jesus; and the
        glory that the Father gives to Him, He gives to them, John 18:22. They
        participate of the same Spirit with Him; for they that have not the
        Spirit of Christ are none of His. That same life that He has is
        conferred on them; and because He lives, they live also. He is the
        fountain of their life, Psalm 36:9. The glory of their bodies will be of
        the same kind with His, Philippians 3:21. The glory that the Father gave
        to Him, He has given to them, John 17:22.
      </p>
      <p>
        They shall be admitted to the same glorious place with Him, and shall
        behold His glory, John 17:24. There must be a conformity between the
        head and the members, but as to the degree, He who is the first-born
        among many brethren must in all things have the pre-eminence. If so be
        that ye suffer with Him. — The Apostle had shown that believers are the
        adopted children of God, heirs of ‘God, and joint heirs with Jesus
        Christ. He now refers to a possible objection, namely, that
        notwithstanding this they are often full of trouble and afflictions in
        this life, which appears not to be suitable to so near a relationship
        with God.
      </p>
      <p>
        This he obviates by reminding them that they suffer with Christ, and
        that their sufferings, which result from their bearing them with Him,
        will issue in future glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sufferings of Jesus Christ are to be regarded in two points of view.
        On the one hand, He suffered as the propitiation for the sins of His
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, His sufferings are to be viewed as the road
        conducting Him to glory. In the first of these His people have no part;
        He alone was the sacrifice offered for their salvation; He alone made
        satisfaction to the justice of God; and He alone merited the reward for
        them. But in the second point of view, He is the pattern of their
        condition; in this they must follow His steps, and be made conformable
        to Him. Suffering, then, is a peculiarity in the earthly lot of all the
        heirs of heaven; they are all called to suffer with Christ. The man
        professing Christ’s religion, who meets with no persecution or
        opposition from the world for Christ’s sake, may well doubt the
        sincerity of his profession. ‘All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
        shall suffer persecution.’ All the heirs will come to the enjoyment of
        their inheritance through tribulation; most of them through much
        tribulation. But so far from this being an argument against the sure
        prospect of that inheritance, it tends to confirm it. The expression ‘if
        so be,’ or since, does not intimate that this is doubtful, but
        establishes its certainty. God causes His children to suffer in
        different ways, and for different reasons, for their good, as for the
        trial of their faith, the exercise of patience, the mortification of
        sin, and in order to wean them from this world and prepare them for
        heaven. Their sufferings are effects of His Fatherly love; and the great
        object of them is, that they may be conformed to Christ. Sufferings are
        appointed for them in order that they should not be condemned with the
        world, and, to work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight
        of glory. That we may be also glorified together. — This ought to
        support Christians under their sufferings. What a consolation in the
        midst of afflictions for Christ’s sake, that they shall also be
        glorified together with Him! In His sufferings He is set forth as their
        pattern, and the issue of them is their encouragement. They have the
        honor of suffering with Him, and they shall have the honor of being
        glorified with Him. They not only accompany him in His sufferings, but
        He also accompanies them in theirs; not only to sympathize with them,
        but to be their surety and defender.
      </p>
      <p>
        This community in suffering with Jesus Christ is sufficient to impart to
        His people the highest consolation. What an honor is it to bear, here
        below, His cross, on the way to where one day they shall have a place
        upon His throne! Having the same enemies with Him, they must have the
        some combats, the same victories, and the same triumphs. Since the Lord
        has been pleased to suffer for them before reigning over them in heaven,
        it is proper that they should suffer also for His sake and in the
        prospect of reigning with Him. For suffering with Him, they shall
        overcome with Him; and overcoming with Him, they shall obtain the crown
        of life and eternal glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
        worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had been reminding those to whom he wrote, that their
        sufferings with Christ is the way appointed by God to bring them to
        glory. Here he encourages them to endure affliction, because there is no
        comparison between their present sufferings and their future glory. In
        order to encourage the Israelites to sustain the difficulties that
        presented themselves to their entry into Canaan, God sent them of the
        fruits of the land while they were still in the desert. Our blessed
        Lord, too, permitted some of His disciples to witness His
        transfiguration, when His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was
        white as light. This was calculated to inspire them with an ardent
        desire to behold that heavenly glory, of which, on that occasion, they
        had a transient glimpse, and to render them more patient in sustaining
        the troubles they were about to encounter. In the same manner God acts
        towards His people when they suffer in this world. He sends them of the
        fruits of the heavenly Canaan, and allowing them to enjoy a measure of
        that peace which passeth all understanding, He favors them with some
        foretastes of the glory to be revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first testimony to the truth that the, Apostle is here declaring is
        his own. I reckon. — Paul was better qualified to judge in this matter
        than any other man, both as having endured the greatest sufferings, and
        as having been favored with a sight of the glory of heaven. His
        sufferings, Corinthians 4:9; 2 Corinthians 11:23, appear not to have
        been inferior to those that exercised the patience of Job, while his
        being caught up into the third heaven was peculiar to himself. But,
        independently of this, we have here the testimony of an inspired
        Apostle, which must be according to truth, as being immediately
        communicated by the Holy Ghost. Paul makes use of a word which refers to
        the casting up of an account, marking accurately the calculation, by
        comparing one thing with another, so as to arrive at the true result.
        The sufferings of the present time. — By this we are reminded that the
        present is a time of suffering, and that this world is to believers as a
        field of battle. The shortness, too, of the period of suffering is
        indicated. It is limited to the present life, respecting which man is
        compared to a flower which cometh forth and is cut down; to a shadow
        that fleeth and continueth not. ‘His days are swifter than a post; and
        as the flight of the eagle hastening after its prey.’ It is in the
        present time exclusively that sufferings are to be endured by the
        children of God. But if they promise to themselves the enjoyment of ease
        and carnal prosperity, they miscalculate the times, and confound the
        present with the future. They forget the many assurances of their
        Heavenly Father that this is not their rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        They overlook the example of those who by faith obtained a good report.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing
        rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
        pleasures of sin for a season. David, envying for a moment the
        prosperity of the wicked, having entered the sanctuary and considered
        their end, views it in a different light. ‘Nevertheless I am continually
        with Thee; Thou hast holden me by Thy right hand; Thou shalt guide me
        with Thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.’ ‘In Thy presence
        is fullness of joy; at Thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.’
        ‘Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their
        corn and their wine increased. I will both lay me down in peace and
        sleep, for Thou, Lord, only makest me to dwell in safety.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians often dwell upon their own sufferings, while they overlook
        the sufferings of their Lord, to whom they must be conformed. They
        forget their sins, on account of which they receive chastisement that
        they may not be condemned with the world, and for which they must also
        partake of their bitter fruits. But as there is no proportion between
        what is finite, however great it may be, and what is infinite, so their
        afflictions here, even were their lives prolonged to any period, and
        although they had no respite, would bear no proportion to their future
        glory either in intensity or duration The felicity of that glory is
        unspeakable, but their afflictions here are not insupportable. They are
        always accompanied with the compassion and the consolations of God. ‘As
        the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth
        by Christ.’ The patriarch Jacob, a fugitive from his father’s house,
        constrained to pass the night without a covering, with stones only for
        his pillow, enjoyed a vision excelling all with which he had been before
        favored. This is recorded to show that the believer, in his tribulation,
        often experiences more joy and peace than in his prosperity. ‘Thus saith
        the Lord God, although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and
        although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to
        them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.’ God
        never permits the sufferings of His people to be extreme. The glory that
        shall be revealed. — While the sufferings of believers here are only
        temporary, the glory which is to be revealed is eternal. Though yet
        concealed, it is already in existence, its discovery only is future. Now
        it is veiled from us in heaven, but ere long it shall be revealed. God
        is a source of ineffable light, joy, knowledge, power, and goodness. He
        is the sovereign good, and will communicate Himself to them that behold
        Him, in a way that is incomprehensible. In us. — The glory here spoken
        of is that to which the Apostle John refers, when he says that we shall
        see the Lord as He is, and that we shall be made like Him. If the rays
        of the sun illuminate the darkness on which they shine, what will be
        that light which the Sun of Righteousness will produce in the children
        of Him who is the Father of Lights! If the face of Moses shone, when,
        amidst the terrors of the law, he talked with God, what shall their
        condition be who shall behold Him, not on the mountain that might be
        touched, and that burned with fire, but in the heaven of heavens; not
        amidst thunderings and lightnings, but amidst the express testimonies of
        His favor and blessing They shall appear in the sanctuary of the Lord,
        and discern plainly the mysteries of the wisdom of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        They shall behold not the ark and the propitiatory, but the things in
        the heavens which these were made to represent. They shall see as they
        are seen, and know as they are known. To the enjoyment of this glory
        after the persecutions and troubles of this life, the Bridegroom is
        represented as calling His Church. ‘Lo, the winter is past, the rain is
        over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing
        of birds is come. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.’ As there
        is no proportion between finite and infinite, so no comparison can be
        made between the things that are seen and temporal, and the things that
        are unseen and eternal — between our light afflictions which are but for
        a moment, and that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory that
        shall be revealed in us. Such is the consolation which the Apostle here
        presents to the children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19-22. — For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for
        the manifestation of the sons of God (for the creature was made subject
        to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the
        same), in hope that the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
        bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
        For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
        together until now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 18th verse, the Apostle, for the comfort of believers, had
        declared that there is reserved for them a weight of glory to which
        their sufferings while in this world bear no comparison. To the same
        purpose he now refers to the existing state and future destination of
        the visible creation. In thus appealing to a double testimony — the one
        the voice of grace uttered by himself, the other the voice of universal
        nature, which speaks the same language — he encourages the children of
        God to endure with patience their present trials.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verses before us, Paul, by an example of personification common
        in the Scriptures, which consists in attributing human affections to
        things inanimate or unintelligent, calls the attention of believers to
        the fact that the whole creation is in a state of suffering and
        degradation; and that, wearied with the vanity to which it has been
        reduced, it is earnestly looking for deliverance.
      </p>
      <p>
        That interpretation which, according to Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart,
        applies this expectation to mankind in general, is contrary to fact. Men
        in general are not looking for a glorious deliverance, nor is it a fact
        that they will obtain it; but it is a fact that there will be new
        heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. All that Mr.
        Stuart alleges against this is easily obviated. Most of it applies to
        passages that have been injudiciously appealed to on the subject, which
        do not bear the conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if the earth, after being burnt up, shall be restored in glory,
        there is a just foundation for the figurative expectation. In order to
        understand these verses, it is necessary to ascertain the import, — 1st
        , of the term creation, or creature; 2nd , of that of the vanity to
        which it is subjected; 3rd , of that deliverance which it shall
        experience. Creature. — The word in the original, which is translated in
        the 19th, 20th, and 21st verses, creature, and in the 22nd, creation,
        can have no reference to the fallen angels, for they do not desire the
        manifestation of the children of God; this they dread, and, looking
        forward to it, tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither can it refer to the elect angels, of whom it cannot be said that
        they shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, for to this they
        were never subjected. It does not apply to men, all of whom are either
        the children of God or of the wicked one. It cannot refer to the
        children of God, for they are here expressly distinguished from the
        creation of which the Apostle speaks; nor can it apply to wicked men,
        for they have no wish for the manifestation of the sons of God whom they
        hate, nor will they ever be delivered from the bondage of corruption,
        but cast into the lake of fire. It remains, then, that the creatures
        destitute of intelligence, animate and inanimate, the heavens and the
        earth, the elements, the plants and animals, are here referred to. The
        Apostle means to say that the creation, which, on account of sin, has,
        by the sentence of God, been subjected to vanity, shall be rescued from
        the present degradation under which it groans, and that, according to
        the hope held out to it, is longing to participate with the sons of God
        in that freedom from vanity into which it shall at length be introduced,
        partaking with them in their future and glorious deliverance from all
        evil. This indeed cannot mean that the plants and animals, as they at
        present exist, shall be restored; but that the condition of those things
        which shall belong to the new heavens and the new earth, prepared for
        the sons of God, shall be delivered from the curse, and restored to a
        perfect state, as when all things that God had created were pronounced
        by Him very good, and when, as at the beginning, before sin entered,
        they shall be fully adapted to the use of man.
      </p>
      <p>
        As men earnestly desire what is good, and, on the contrary, groan and
        sigh in their sufferings, the like emotions of joy and sorrow are here
        ascribed to the inanimate and unintelligent creation. In this way the
        prophets introduce the earth as groaning, and the animals as crying to
        God, in sympathy with the condition of man. ‘The land mourneth, for the
        corn is wasted; the new wine is dried up; the oil languisheth, because
        joy is withered away from the sons of men! How do the beasts groan! The
        beasts of the field cry also unto Thee!’ Joel 1:10-20. ‘How long shall
        the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness
        of them that dwell therein?’ Jeremiah 12:4. ‘The earth mourneth and
        fadeth away; the world languishes and fadeth away; the haughty people of
        the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled, under the inhabitants
        thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance,
        broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the
        earth. The new wine mourneth; the wine languisheth!’ Isaiah. 24:4-7. To
        the same purpose, Isaiah 13:13, 33:9, 34:4. On the other hand, the
        Prophet Isaiah, 49:13, predicting a better state of things, exclaims,
        ‘Sing, O heavens; and be joyful O earth; and break forth into singing, O
        mountains; for the Lord hath comforted His people, and will have mercy
        upon His afflicted!’ And in Psalm 98:4-6, ‘Make a joyful noise unto the
        Lord, all the earth; make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praises!
        Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof! Let the floods clap their
        hands: let the hills be joyful together!’ Thus, in the language of
        Scripture, the sins of men cause the creation to mourn; but the mercy of
        God, withdrawing His rebukes, causeth it to rejoice. Vanity. — What is
        called vanity in the 20th verse, is in the 21st denominated bondage of
        corruption. When the creation was brought into existence, God bestowed
        on it His blessing, and pronounced everything that He had made very
        good. Viewing that admirable palace which He had provided, He appointed
        man to reign in it, commanding all creation to be subject to him whom He
        had made in His own image. But when sin entered, then, in a certain
        sense, it may be said that all things had become evil, and were diverted
        from their proper end. The creatures by their nature were appointed for
        the service of the friends of their Creator; but since the entrance of
        sin they had become subservient to His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of the sun and the heavens being honored to give light to those
        who obey God, and the earth to support the righteous, they now minister
        to rebels. The sun shines upon the wicked, the earth nourishes those who
        blaspheme their Maker; while its various productions, instead of being
        employed for the glory of God, are used as instruments of ambition, of
        avarice, of intemperance, of cruelty, of idolatry, and are often
        employed for the destruction of His children. All these are subjected to
        vanity when applied by men for vain purposes. This degradation is a
        grievance to the works of God, which in themselves have remained in
        allegiance. They groan under it, but, keeping within their proper
        limits, hold on their course. Had it been the will of the Creator, after
        the entrance of sin, the creature might have refused to serve the vices,
        or even the necessities of man. This is sometimes threatened. In
        reproving the idolatry of the children of Israel, God speaks as if He
        intended to withdraw His creatures from their service, in taking them
        entirely away. ‘Therefore will I return and take away My corn in the
        time thereof, and My wine in the season thereof, and will recover My
        wool and My flax given to cover her nakedness,’ Hosea 2:9. And sometimes
        the creature is represented as reclaiming against the covetousness and
        wickedness of men. ‘The stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam
        out of the timber shall answer it,’ Habakkuk 2:11.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole creation, then, groaneth together, and is under bondage on
        account of the sin of man, and has suffered by it immensely. As to the
        inanimate creation, in many ways it shows its figurative groaning, and
        the vanity to which it has been reduced. ‘Cursed is the ground for thy
        sake; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee.’ It
        produces all noxious weeds, and in many places is entirely barren. It is
        subject to earthquakes, floods, and storms destructive to human life,
        and in various respects labors under the curse pronounced upon it. The
        lower animals have largely shared in the sufferings of man. They are
        made ‘to be taken and destroyed,’ Peter 2:12, and to devour one another.
        They have become subservient to the criminal pleasures of man, and are
        the victims of his oppressive cruelty. Some partake in the labors to
        which he is subjected; and all of them terminate their short existence
        by death, the effect of sin. All that belongs to the creation is fading
        and transitory, and death reigns universally. The heavens and the earth
        shall wax old like a garment. The earth once perished by water, and now
        it is reserved unto fire. ‘The heavens shall pass away with a great
        noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also and
        the works that are therein shall be burnt up. The heavens being on fire
        shall be dissolved.’ The cause of this subjection to vanity is not from
        their original tendencies, or from any fault in the creatures. They have
        been so subjected, not willingly, not owing to any natural defect or
        improper disposition in themselves, but by reason of the sin of man, and
        in order to his greater punishment. The houses of those who were guilty
        of rebellion were destroyed, Ezra 6:11; Daniel 2:5, not that there was
        guilt in the stones or the wood, but in order to inflict the severer
        punishment on their criminal possessors, and also to testify the greater
        abhorrence of their crime, in thus visiting them in the things that
        belonged to them. In the same manner, man, haring been constituted the
        Lord of the creatures, his punishment has been extended to them. This in
        a very striking manner demonstrates the hatred of God against sin. For
        as the leprosy not only defiled the man who was infected with it, but
        also the house he inhabited, in the same way, sin, which is the
        spiritual leprosy of man, has not only defiled our bodies and our souls,
        but, by the just judgment of God, has infected all creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In whatever way it may be attempted to be accounted for, it is a fact
        that the world and all around us is in a suffering and degraded
        condition. This state of things bears the appearance of being
        inconsistent with the government of God, all-powerful, wise, and good.
        The proud skeptic is here completely at a stand. He cannot even
        conjecture why such a state of things should have had place. With Mr.
        Hume, the language of every reflecting unbeliever must be, ‘The whole is
        a riddle, an enigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt, uncertainty,
        suspense of judgment, appear the only result of our most accurate
        scrutiny concerning this subject.’ The Book of God alone dispels the
        darkness, and unveils the mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, then, we learn how great is the evil of sin. It has polluted the
        heavens and the earth and has subjected the whole to vanity and
        corruption. Evil and misery prevail, and creation itself is compelled to
        witness the dishonor done to its Author. It would be derogatory to the
        glory of God to suppose that His works are now in the same condition in
        which they were at first formed, or that they will always continue as at
        present. In the meantime, all the creatures are groaning under their
        degradation, until the moment when God shall remove those obstacles
        which prevent them from answering their proper ends, and render them
        incapable of suitably glorifying Him. But the righteous Judge, who
        subjected them to vanity in consequence of the disobedience of man; has
        made provision for their final restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creation, then, is not in that state in which it was originally
        constituted. A fearful change and disorganization, even in the frame of
        the natural world, has taken place. The introduction of sin has brought
        along with it this subjection to vanity and the bondage of corruption,
        and all that ruin under which nature groans. How miserable is the
        condition of those who have their portion in this world! Of them it may
        be truly said, ‘Surely they have inherited lies, vanity, and things
        wherein there is no profit.’ Of those ‘who mind earthly things,’ it is
        written, their ‘end is destruction.’ ‘The heavens and the earth which
        are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against
        the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.’ Delivered. — Some
        suppose that the word delivered signifies an entire annihilation, and in
        support of this opinion allege such passages as Peter 3:10; Revelation
        20:11. But as a tendency of all things in nature is to their own
        preservation, how could the creation be represented as earnestly
        expecting the manifestation of the sons of God, if that manifestation
        were to be accompanied with its final ruin and destruction?
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, the Apostle promises not merely a future deliverance, but also
        a glorious future existence. The Scriptures, too, in various places,
        predict the continued subsistence of the heavens and the earth, as 2
        Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:1. Respecting the passages quoted above, as
        importing their annihilation, it ought to be observed that the
        destruction off the substance of things differs from a change in their
        qualities. When metal of a certain shape is subjected to fire, it is
        destroyed as to its figure, but not as to its substance. Thus the
        heavens and the earth will pass through the fire, but only that they may
        be purified and come forth anew, more excellent than before. In <19A226>
        Psalm 102:26, it is said, ‘They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure;
        yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shall Thou
        change them, and they shall be changed. ’ That the Apostle Peter, when
        he says that the heavens shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt
        with fervent heat, does not refer to the destruction of their substance,
        but to their purification, is evident from what he immediately adds, —
        ’Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a
        new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness;’ A little before he had said,
        ‘The world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished,’
        although its substance remains as at the beginning. If, then, the
        punishment of sin has extended to the creatures, in bringing them under
        the bondage of corruption, so, according to the passage before us, that
        grace which reigns above sin, will also be extended to their
        deliverance. And, as the punishment of the sins of men is so much the
        greater as their effects extend to the creatures, in like manner so much
        the greater will be the glory that shall be revealed in them, that the
        creatures which were formed for their use shall be made to participate
        with them in the day of the restitution of all things. Through the
        goodness of God they shall follow the deliverance and final destination
        of the children of God, and not that of His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When God created the world, He ‘saw everything that He had made, and,
        behold, it was very good.’ When man transgressed, God viewed it a second
        time, and said, ‘Cursed is the ground for thy sake.’ When the promise
        that the Deliverer should come into the world to re-establish peace
        between God and man was given, the effect of this blessed reconciliation
        was to extend even to the inanimate and unintelligent creation; and God,
        it may be said, then viewed His work a third time, and held out the hope
        of a glorious restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creature, then, has been subjected to the indignity which it now
        suffers, in hope that it will one day be delivered from the bondage of
        corruption, and partake of the glorious freedom of the children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hope was held out in the sentence pronounced on man, for, in the
        doom of our first parents, the Divine purpose of providing a deliverer
        was revealed. We know not the circumstances of this change, how it will
        be effected, or in what form the creation — those new heavens and that
        new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness, suited for the abode of the
        sons of God — shall then exist; but we are sure that it shall be worthy
        of the Divine wisdom, although at present beyond our comprehension.
        Manifestation of the sons of God. — Believers are even now The sons of
        God, but the world knows them not, 1 John 3:1. In this respect they are
        not seen. Their bodies, as well as their spirits, have been purchased by
        Christ, and they are become His members. Their bodies have, however, no
        marks of this Divine relation, but, like those of other men, are subject
        to disease, to death, and corruption. And although they have been
        regenerated by the Spirit of God, there is still a law in their members
        warring against the law of their mind. But the period approaches when
        their souls shall be freed from every remainder of corruption, and their
        bodies shall be made like unto the glorious body of the Son of God. Then
        this corruptible shall put on in corruption, and then shall they shine
        forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. It is then that they
        shall be manifested in their true character, illustrious as the sons of
        God, seated upon thrones, and conspicuous in robes of light and glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first
        fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
        for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the four preceding verses, the Apostle had appealed to the state of
        nature, which, by a striking and beautiful figure, is personified and
        represented as groaning under the oppression of suffering, through the
        entrance of sin, and looking forward with ardent expectation, as with
        outstretched neck, to a future and better dispensation. He now proceeds
        to call the attention of believers to their own feelings and experience,
        meaning to say that if the unintelligent creation is longing for the
        manifestation of the sons of God, how much more earnestly must they
        themselves long for that glorious event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians who have received the foretastes of everlasting- felicity,
        sympathize with the groans of nature. They enjoy, indeed, even at
        present, a blessed freedom. They are delivered from the guilt and
        dominion of sin, the curse of the law, and a servile spirit in their
        obedience to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, however, they have much to suffer while in the world; but they
        wait for the redemption of their bodies, and the full manifestation of
        their character as the children of God. Their bodies, as well as their
        spirits, have been given to Christ. They are equally the fruit of His
        purchase, and are become His members. But it is not till His people
        shall have arisen from the grave that they will enjoy all the privileges
        consequent on His redemption. The first fruits of the Spirit. — These
        are love and joy in the Holy Ghost, peace of conscience, and communion
        with God. They are the graces of the Spirit conferred on believers,
        called first fruits, because, as the first fruits of the fields were
        offered to God under the law, so these graces redound to God’s glory.
        And as the first ears of corn were a pledge of an abundant harvest, so
        these graces are a pledge to believers of their complete felicity,
        because they are given to them Of God for the confirmation of their
        hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are a pledge, because the same love and grace that moved their
        Heavenly Father to impart these beginnings of their salvation will move
        Him to perfect the good work. These first fruits, then, are the
        foretastes of heaven, or the earnest of the inheritance. This is the
        most invaluable privilege of the children of God in the present life. It
        is a joy the world cannot give and cannot take away. The error which
        would represent these privileges as peculiar to the Apostles and the
        first Christians, and restrict the fruits of the Spirit to miraculous
        gifts, ought not for one moment to be admitted. The Apostle is speaking
        of all the children of God to the end of the world, without excepting
        even the weakeSt. As the first fruits of the harvest were consecrated to
        God, so we should be careful not to abuse the gifts of the Spirit of God
        in us. As the first fruits were to be carried to the house of God, so,
        as God has communicated to us His grace, we should also go to His house
        making a public profession of His name. The children of Israel, in
        offering the first fruits, were commanded to confess their miserable
        original state, and to recount their experience of the goodness of God,
        Deuteronomy 26:5. In the same way we should consider the graces of the
        Holy Spirit in us as the first fruits of the heavenly Canaan which God
        hath given us, and confess that we were by nature children of wrath,
        dead in trespasses and sins, and that the Lord, having had compassion on
        us, has delivered us from the servitude of sin, and the power of
        darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son. Groan
        within ourselves. — Not only they — the whole creation or every creature
        — but also believers themselves, will all their advantages, groan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even they find it difficult to bear up under the pressure which in their
        present state weighs them down, while carrying about with them a body of
        sin and death. Of this groaning the Apostle, as we have seen, ch. 7:24,
        presents himself as an example, — ’O wretched man that I am;’ and again
        when he says, ‘We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened,’
        2 Corinthians 5:4. In the same manner David groaned, when he complained
        that his iniquities were a burden too heavy for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers groan on account of indwelling sin, of the temptations of
        Satan and the world, and of the evils that afflict their bodies and
        souls. They feel that something is always wanting to them in this world.
        There is nothing but that sovereign good, which can only be found in
        God, fully able to satisfy their desires. Believers groan within
        themselves. Their groanings are not such as those of hypocrites, which
        are only outward; they are from within. They do not always meet the ear
        of man, but they reach the throne of God. ‘All my desire,’ says David,
        ‘is before Thee, and my groaning is not hid from Thee,’ Psalm 38:9.
        These groanings are sighs and prayers to God, which are spoken of in the
        26th verse of this chapter, where we learn their efficient cause, which
        is not flesh and blood. They are fruits of the Spirit, so that by them
        believes observe in themselves the spirit of regeneration. Waiting for
        the adoption. — Believers have already been adopted into the family of
        God, and are His children; but they have not yet been openly declared to
        be so, nor made in all respects suitable to this character. If they are
        the sons of God, they must be made glorious, both in soul and body; but
        till they arrive in heaven, their adoption will not be fully manifested.
        Adoption may be viewed at three periods. It may be considered in the
        election of His people, when God decrees their adoption before they are
        called or united to Jesus Christ; yet they are even then denominated the
        children of God. In the eleventh chapter of John, where Caiaphas,
        prophesying of the death of Jesus, says that he should die, not for that
        nation only, but for all the children of God that were scattered abroad.
        Under the term children of God were comprehended those who had not yet
        been called, Acts 18:10. In their calling and regeneration they are
        adopted into God’s family, being then united to Christ; but as their
        bodies do not partake in that regeneration, and are not yet conformed to
        the glorious body of Jesus Christ, they still wait for the entire
        accomplishment of their adoption, when, at the resurrection, they shall
        enter on the full possession of the inheritance. Accordingly Jesus
        denominates that blessed resurrection ‘the regeneration,’ because then
        not only the souls of believers, but also their bodies, shall bear the
        heavenly image of the second Adam. Then they shall enter fully into the
        possession of their inheritance; for in that day Jesus Christ will say
        to His elect ‘Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
        prepared for you from the foundation of the world.’ Heaven, into which
        they will then enter, is an inheritance suitable to the dignity of the
        sons of God, and for this they are waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The children of God wait for the accomplishment of all that their
        adoption imports. They wait for it as Jacob did. ‘I have waited for Thy
        salvation, O Lord!’ Genesis 49:18. They wait as the believers at Corinth
        were waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Corinthians 1:7;
        and as all believers who through the Spirit wait for the hope of
        righteousness by faith, Galatians 5:5. ‘Looking for the blessed hope,
        and the glorious appearing of the great God, even our Savior Jesus
        Christ,’ Titus 2:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as the Thessalonians, who, having been turned from idols to serve
        the living and true God, waited for His Son from heaven, 1 Thessalonians
        1:10; also as is recorded in Hebrews 9:28; James 5:7,8; 2 Peter 3:12. In
        this manner Paul waited for his crown, 2 Timothy 4:8. It was this
        waiting for, or expectation of, deliverance from the Lord, that
        encouraged Noah to build the ark, and Abraham to leave his country, and
        Moses to esteem the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
        in Egypt, and the elders who obtained a good report through faith, to
        seek a better, that is, an heavenly country. It was the expectation of
        eternal life that sustained those who shed their blood for the testimony
        of Jesus. The redemption of our body. — That there might be no mistake
        respecting the meaning of the adoption in this unusual application, the
        Apostle himself subjoins an explanation — even the redemption of our
        body, because the body will then be delivered from the grave, as a
        prisoner when redeemed is delivered from his prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why, it may be asked, does the Apostle here employ the term
        redemption rather than that of resurrection, which is so common in the
        New Testament? To this it may be replied, that the Holy Scriptures often
        make use of this expression to represent a great deliverance, as in
        <19A702> Psalm 107:2: ‘Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath
        redeemed from the hand of the enemy’ And as in Isaiah 63, where those
        are spoken of who are redeemed of the Lord from the hand of the enemy.
        It is evident that Paul employs this expression forcibly to designate
        the greatest of all deliverances, the highest object of our desires,
        which is to be the subject of our eternal gratitude. When this term is
        so used, it commonly denotes two things, — the one, that the deliverance
        spoken of is effected in a manner glorious and conspicuous, exhibiting
        the greatest effort of power; the other, that it is a complete
        deliverance, placing us beyond all danger. On this ground, then, it is
        evident that no work is better entitled to the appellation of redemption
        than that of the re-establishment of our bodies, which will be an
        illustrious effect of the infinite power of God. It is the work of the
        Lord of nature — of Him who holds in His hands the keys of life and
        death. His light alone can dispel the darkness of the tomb. It is only
        His hand that can break its seal and its silence. On this account the
        Apostle appeals, with an accumulation of terms, to the exceeding
        greatness of the power of God to upward who believe, according to the
        working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised
        Him from the dead, Ephesians 1:19,20.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last deliverance will be so perfect, that nothing can be more
        complete, since ‘the children of the resurrection’ shall be restored not
        to their first life, but to a state which will be one of surpassing
        glory and never-ending immortality. Death will be swallowed up in
        victory. Earthly warriors may obtain two sorts of victories over their
        enemies. One may be called a temporary or partial victory, which causes
        the enemy to fly, which deprives him of part of his force, but does not
        prevent him from re-establishing himself; returning to the field of
        battle, and placing the conqueror in the hazard of losing what he has
        gained. The other may be termed a complete and decisive victory, which
        so effectually subdues the hostile power, that it can never regain what
        it has lost. There are also two sorts of resurrections, one like that of
        Lazarus, in which death was overcome but not destroyed, since Lazarus
        died a second time; the other is, that of believers at the last day,
        when death will not only be overcome, but cast out and for ever
        exterminated. Both of these may be properly called a resurrection; but
        to speak with greater force, the second is here called a redemption.
        Besides, the Apostle, in employing this term, has reference to the
        redemption which Jesus Christ has effected at the infinite price of His
        blood. It is true this price was fully paid on the day of His death; yet
        two things are certain: the one is, that our resurrection will only take
        place in virtue of the value and imperishable efficacy of that blood,
        which has acquired for us life and happiness; the other, that the
        redemption accomplished on the cross and the resurrection are not two
        different works. They are hut one work, viewed under different aspects,
        and at different periods; the redemption on the cross being our
        redemption by price, and the resurrection our redemption by power — a
        perfect and undivided salvation begun and terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day, then, of the redemption of our bodies will be the day of the
        entire accomplishment of our adoption, as then only we shall enter on
        the complete possession of the children of God. In Jesus Christ our
        redemption was fully accomplished when He said on the cross, ‘It is
        finished.’ In us it is accomplished by different degrees. The first
        degree is in this life; the second, at death; the third, at the
        resurrection. In this life, the degree of redemption which we obtain is
        the remission of our sins, our sanctification, and freedom from the law
        and the slavery of sin. At death, our souls are delivered from all sin,
        and their sanctification is complete; for the soul, at its departure
        from the body, is received into the heavenly sanctuary, into which
        nothing can enter that defileth; and as to the body, death prepares it
        for in corruption and immortality, for that which we sow is not
        quickened except it die. It must therefore return to dust, there to
        leave its corruption, its weakness, its dishonor. Hence it follows that
        believers should not fear death, since death obtains for them the second
        degree of their redemption. But as our bodies remain in the dust till
        the day of our blessed resurrection, that day is called the day of the
        redemption of our body, as being the last and highest degree of our
        redemption. Then the body being reunited to the soul, death will be
        swallowed up in victory; for the last enemy that shall be destroyed is
        death, for till then death will reign over our bodies. But then the
        children of God shall sing that triumphant song, ‘O death, where is thy
        sting? O grave, where is thy victory?’ ‘I will ransom them from the
        power of the grave; I will redeem them from death; O death, I will be
        thy plague; O grave, I will be thy destruction.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The elevation of His people to glory on the day of their redemption,
        will be the last act in the economy of Jesus Christ as Mediator. He will
        then terminate His reign and the whole work of their salvation. For then
        He will present the whole Church to the Father, saying, ‘Behold I and
        the children whom Thou hast given Me.’ Then He will deliver up the
        kingdom, having nothing further to do in the work of redemption. This
        will be the rendering of the account by the Son to the Father of the
        charge committed to Him; and for this reason the Apostle says, ‘When all
        things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be
        subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in
        all;’ because, as His economy commenced by an act of submission of the
        Son to the Father, when in entering into the world He said, ‘Lo, I come
        to do Thy will, O God,’ it will also terminate by a similar act, as the
        Son will then deliver up the kingdom to Him from whom He received it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers are here said to have received the first fruits of the Spirit,
        and to be waiting for the redemption of their bodies. In the fourth
        chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, the Apostle says, ‘Grieve not
        the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
        redemption.’ As this last passage has so much similarity to the one
        before us, and as they are calculated to throw light on each other, it
        may be proper in this place to consider its meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sealing of believers implies that God has marked them by His Spirit
        to distinguish them from the rest of mankind. Marking His people in this
        manner as His peculiar property, imports that He loves them as His own;
        that they are His ‘jewels,’ or peculiar treasure, Malachi 3:17. But the
        Apostle does not say that believers have been merely marked, but that
        they have been sealed, which implies much more; for although every seal
        is a mark, every mark is not a seal. Seals are marks which bear the arms
        of those to whom they belong, and often their image or resemblance, as
        the seals of princes. Thus the principal effect of the Holy Spirit is to
        impress on the hearts of His people the image of the Son of God. As the
        matter to which the seal is applied contributes nothing to the formation
        of the character it receives, and only yields to the impression made on
        it, so the heart is not active, but passive, under the application of
        this Divine seal, by which we receive the image of God, the characters
        of which are traced by the Holy Spirit, and depend for their formation
        entirely on His efficiency. As seals confirm the covenants or promises
        to which they are affixed, in the same manner this heavenly signet
        firmly establishes the declaration of the Divine mercy, and makes it
        irreversible. It confirms to our faith the mysteries of the Gospel, and
        renders certain to our hope the promises of the covenant. The seal of
        man, although it alters the form, makes no change on the substance of
        the matter to which it is applied, and possesses no virtue to render it
        proper for receiving the impression. But the seal of God changes the
        matter on which it is impressed, and although naturally hard, renders it
        impressible, converting a heart of stone into a heart of flesh. The seal
        of man is speedily withdrawn from the matter it impresses, and the
        impression gradually becomes faint, till it is at length effaced. But
        the seal of the Holy Spirit remains in the heart, so that the image it
        forms can never be obliterated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle not only affirms that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit of
        God, but says that we are sealed unto the day of redemption; that is,
        this seal is given us in respect of our blessed resurrection; as the
        pledge of our complete transformation into the likeness of Christ. This
        Divine seal is that by which the Lord our great Judge will distinguish
        the righteous from the wicked, raising the one to the resurrection of
        life, and the other to the resurrection of damnation. It is also the
        Holy Spirit which forms in us the hope of that future redemption, our
        souls having no good desire whatever of which He is not the author.
        These things are certain; but it does not appear to be the principal
        design of the Apostle to enforce them here. It seems rather to be to
        teach that the Holy Spirit is to us a seal or assured pledge of the
        reality of our resurrection, or, as is said, ‘the earnest of our
        inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.’ Besides
        this, the Holy Spirit confirms in our souls everything on which the hope
        of our resurrection depends.
      </p>
      <p>
        That hope depends on the belief that Jesus Christ has died for our sins,
        of which the Holy Spirit bears record in our hearts by giving us the
        answer of a God conscience. It depends on knowing that Jesus Christ has
        in dying overcome death, and has gloriously risen again to restore to us
        life which we had forfeited. This is a truth which the Holy Spirit
        certifies to us, since He is the Spirit of Christ given in virtue of His
        resurrection. It depends on knowing that Jesus Christ is in heaven,
        reigning at the right hand of the Father, and that all power is given
        unto Him, that He may give eternal life to all His people. The Holy
        Spirit testifies to us this glory since His coming is its fruit and
        effect. ‘The Holy Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not
        yet glorified;’ and the Savior Himself says that He will send the
        Comforter, ‘even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,’
        concerning which the Apostle Peter declares, ‘Being by the right hand of
        God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy
        Ghost, He hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.’ As if he had
        said that this marvelous effusion of the Holy Spirit is an effect, and
        consequently an assured proof, of the heavenly glory of Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since God gives His Holy Spirit to His children to seal them to the day
        of redemption, it is evident that His care of them must extend to the
        blessed consummation to which He purposes to conduct them. He will not
        withdraw His gracious hand from them, but will bring them to the
        possession and enjoyment of His glory. ‘The Lord will perfect that which
        concerneth me.’ ‘Being confident of this very thing, that He which hath
        begun a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be remarked that the Apostle says ‘unto the day of redemption,’
        and not simply, to the redemption. This expression, the day of
        redemption’s leads us to consider the advantage that grace has over
        nature, and the future world over that which we now inhabit. When God
        created the universe, He made light and darkness, day and night; and our
        time consists of their alternate successions. But it will not be so in
        the second creation, for ‘there shall be no night there.’ It will be one
        perpetual day of life without death, of holiness without sin, and of joy
        without grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day here referred to may be viewed in contrast with two other solemn
        days, both of which are celebrated in the Scriptures. One is the day of
        Sinai, the other of Pentecost: this is the day of redemption. In the
        economy of the Father, the first was a day of public and extraordinary
        grandeur, appointed to display in the most remarkable manner His glory,
        when God descended with awful majesty amidst blackness, and darkness,
        and tempest: In the economy of the Holy Ghost, the second was the day
        when He came as a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, when
        the Apostles were assembled, and, under the symbol of cloven tongues of
        fire, rested upon them. In the economy of the Son, there will also be a
        day of public magnificence, and that will be the day of judgment, when,
        seated on the throne of His glory, Jesus Christ will come with His
        mighty angels to judge the quick and the dead. Then calling His elect
        from the four winds, with the voice of the archangel, He will raise them
        from the dust, and elevate them to the glory of His kingdom. The first
        of these days was the day of the publication of the law; the second was
        the day of the publication of grace; and the third will be the day of
        the publication of glory. This will be the day of the complete
        redemption of the children of God, unto which they have been sealed, and
        of their manifestation in their proper character. It will be the day
        when their bodies shall come forth from the grave, made like unto the
        glorious body of the Son of God, by the sovereign efficacy of the
        application of His blood, and by His infinite power. Then shall the
        righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Then
        they shall inherit the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth
        righteousness, which they now expect according to the promise, for God
        will make all things new. Then they shall be with Jesus where He is and
        shall behold His glory which God hath given Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let those rejoice who are waiting for the Divine Redeemer. Their bodies
        indeed must be dissolved, and it doth not yet appear what they shall be.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at that great day they shall be raised up incorruptible, they shall
        be rendered immortal, and shall dwell in heavenly mansions. And that
        they may not doubt this, God has already marked them with His Divine
        seal They have been sealed by the Holy Spirit of God unto the day of the
        redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope;
        for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
      </p>
      <p>
        For we are saved by hope. — According to the original, this phrase may
        either be translated by hope, or in hope; but from the connection it
        appears that it ought to be translated, as in the French versions, in
        hope .
      </p>
      <p>
        The word salvation, or saved, signifies all the benefits of our
        redemption, — namely, remission of sins, sanctification, and
        glorification. ‘The Son of Man is come to save that which was lost.’ In
        this sense Jesus Christ is called the Savior, because it is by Him that
        we are justified and sanctified, and glorified. This word has in
        Scripture sometimes a more limited, and sometimes a more extended,
        meaning. In particular places salvation is spoken of as already
        possessed, as where it is said, God has ‘saved us by the washing of
        regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.’ Generally it signifies
        all the benefits of our redemption, when fully possessed by our final
        admission to glory, as when it is said, ‘He that endureth to the end
        shall be saved.’ In this verse it is regarded as enjoyed only in hope, —
        that is to say, in expectancy, since we have not yet been put in
        possession of the glory of the kingdom of heaven, In order to
        distinguish the measure of salvation which believers have in possession,
        and what they have of it in hope, we must consider its gradations. The
        first of these is their eternal election, of which the Apostle speaks,
        Ephesians 1:3,4, according to which their names were written in heaven
        before the creation of the world. The second gradation is their
        effectual calling, by which God has called them from darkness into the
        kingdom of His beloved Son, so that their souls are already partakers of
        grace, and their bodies habitations of God through the Spirit, and
        members of Jesus Christ. Of these gradations of their salvation they are
        already in possession. But the third gradation, in which sin shall be
        entirely eradicated from their souls, and their bodies shall be made
        like to the glorious body of the Lord Jesus Christ, is as yet enjoyed by
        them only in hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term hope is used in two different senses, — the one proper, and the
        other figurative. Properly, it means the mixture of expectation and
        desire of that to which we look forward, so that we are kept students to
        one object, as where it is said, ‘Hope is the anchor of the soul.’
        Figuratively, it signifies that which we hope for, as when God is called
        our hope — ’Thou art my hope, O Lord God,’ Psalm 71:5; or, ‘Jesus
        Christ, which is our hope,’ 1 Timothy 1:1; and as when it is said, we
        give thanks to God ‘for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,’
        Colossians 1:5. The word hope, then, either denotes as in the verse
        before us, the grace of hope, in reference to the person hoping, or the
        object of hope, in reference to the thing hoped for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope is so closely allied to faith, that sometimes in Scripture it is
        taken for faith itself. They are, however, distinct the one from the
        other. By faith we believe the promises made to us by God; by hope we
        expect to receive the good things which God has promised; so that faith
        hath properly for its object the promise, and hope for its object the
        thing promised, and the execution of the promise. Faith regards its
        object as present, but hope regards it as future. Faith precedes hope,
        and is its foundation. We hope for life eternal, because we believe the
        promises which God has made respecting it; and if we believe these
        promises, we must expect their effect. Hope looks to eternal life as
        that which is future in regard to its remoteness; but in regard to its
        certainty, faith looks to it as a thing that is present. ‘Hope,’ says
        the Apostle, ‘maketh not ashamed;’ and he declares that ‘we rejoice in
        hope of the glory of God.’ Thus he ascribes to it the same certainty as
        to faith; and in the Epistle to the Hebrews he speaks of ‘the full
        assurance of hope.’ Faith and hope are virtues of this like, which will
        have no place in the life that is to come. ‘Now abideth faith, hope, and
        love.’ Faith and hope will cease; and in this respect love is the
        greatest, as love will abide for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objects of the believer’s hope are spiritual and heavenly blessings.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are different from earthly blessings. The men of the world hope for
        riches and the perishable things of this life; the believer hopes for an
        inheritance in heaven, that fadeth not away. For this hope Moses gave up
        the riches and treasures of Egypt. By this hope David distinguishes
        himself from the ungodly. ‘Deliver me from men of the world, which have
        their portion in this life, and whose belly Thou fullest with Thy hid
        treasure; they are full of children, and leave the rest of their
        substance to their babes. As for me, I will behold Thy face in
        righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with Thy likeness,’
        Psalm 17:13-15. And, contrasting his condition with that of the children
        of this world, he says, Psalm 73:7, ‘Their eyes stand out with fatness:
        they have more than heart could wish;’ but as to himself, he had been
        plagued all the day long, and chastened every morning; yet he adds,
        ‘Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou hast holden me by my
        right hand. Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive
        me to glory.’ If it should be said by believers, May not we also hope
        for perishable and temporal blessings? the answer is, that Christian
        hope is founded on the promises of God, and on them it is rested. The
        hope which exceeds these promises is carnal and worldly. To know,
        therefore, what is the object of Christian hope, we must observe what
        are the promises of God. It is true that godliness has the promise of
        the life that now is, and of that which is to come; but respecting this
        life God’s promises are conditional, and to be fulfilled only as He sees
        their accomplishment to be subservient to His glory and our good; while
        as to the life that is to come, they are absolute. Are we, then, to
        expect only ease and happiness in this world, to whom it has been
        declared that ‘we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom
        of God;’ and to whom the Lord Himself says, ‘If any man will come after
        Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me?’ The
        people of God should therefore rest their hope on the absolute promises
        of God, which cannot fail, of blessings that are unperishable, and of a
        real and permanent felicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundations and support of Christian hope are firm and certain.
        First, the word and immutable promise of God; for heaven and earth shall
        pass away, but His word shall remain for ever. God has promised heaven
        as the eternal inheritance of His people. Shall they doubt His fidelity?
        He has said, ‘The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
        My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My
        peace be removed,’ Isaiah 54:10. He has accompanied His promise with His
        oath. ‘Willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the
        immutability of His counsel; that by two immutable things, in which it
        was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who
        have ‘died for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,’ Hebrews
        6:17. We have, besides, the blood of the Son of God, with which His
        promise has been sealed; and His obedience even unto death, which He has
        rendered to His Father, for the foundation of this hope. We have also
        the intercession of our great High Priest, of whom the Apostle, in
        establishing the grounds of the assurance of faith and hope, says not
        only that He is dead, but that He is risen, and at the right hand of
        God; who also maketh intercession for us. He declares, too, that our
        hope enters into heaven, where Jesus our forerunner has entered for us.
        To these foundations of our hope may be added, that it is said, ‘Ye were
        sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our
        inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession.’ The
        Apostle calls this hope an anchor of the soul, — representing the
        believer, in the temptations and assaults to which he is exposed, under
        the similitude of a ship tossed by the sea, but which has an anchor
        fixed in the ground, firm and steadfast, which prevents its being driven
        away by the waves. This hope is not only necessary in adversity, but
        also in prosperity, in raising our affections to things above, and
        disengaging them from the world. The good hope through grace
        tranquilizes the soul. ‘Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art
        thou disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise Him, who
        is the health of my countenance, and my God,’ Psalm 43:5. This hope
        consoles us in life and in death. It softens the bitterness of
        affliction, supports the soul in adversity, and in prosperity raises the
        affections to heavenly objects. It promotes our sanctification; for he
        who hath this hope of beholding Jesus as He is, purifieth himself even
        as He is pure, 1 John 3:3. It assures us that, if Jesus died and rose
        again, them all who sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. Let
        believers renounce their vain hopes of happiness in this world. Here
        they are strangers and pilgrims, and absent from the Lord. Let them hope
        for His presence, and communion with Him in glory. ‘Now,’ says the
        Apostle, ‘the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
        that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian hope is a virtue produced by the Holy Spirit, in which,
        through His power, we should abound, and by which, resting on the
        promises of God in Jesus Christ, we expect our complete salvation. This
        hope is a part of our spiritual armor against principalities and powers,
        and spiritual! wickedness, with which we have to wrestle. We are
        commanded to put on ‘for an helmet the hope of salvation,’ 1
        Thessalonians 5:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse the Apostle had said, ‘We wait for the adoption,
        to wit, the redemption of our body.’ Here he gives it as a reason of our
        waiting, that as yet we are saved only in hope. As far as the price of
        redemption is concerned, we are already saved; but in respect to the
        power by which we shall be put in possession of that for which the price
        has been paid, namely, our deliverance from the remainder of sin under
        which we groan, the resurrection of our bodies, and the enjoyment of the
        eternal inheritance, we are saved only in hope. The hope of all this is
        present with us, but the enjoyment is future. Hope that is seen is not
        hope. — That is, hope cannot respect anything which we already enjoy.
        For it is impossible, as the Apostle subjoins, for a man to hope for
        that which he possesses. Hope and possession are ideas altogether
        incongruous and contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers, then, are as yet saved only in hope. They have received but
        the earnest and foretaste of their salvation. They groan under the
        weight which is borne by them, and their bodies are subject to the
        sentence of temporal death. If they were in the full possession of their
        salvation, faith would no longer be the conviction of things hoped for,
        as things hoped for are not things enjoyed. This corresponds with what
        the Apostle says elsewhere, when he exhorts believers to work out their
        salvation, and when he remarks that our elevation is nearer than when we
        first believed. When it is said we are saved in hope, as it supposes our
        felicity to be future, so it implies that all the good we can for the
        present enjoy of that distant and future felicity is obtained by hoping
        for it; and, therefore, if we could not hope for it, we should lose all
        the encouragement we have in the prospect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — But; if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
        wait for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope produces patience with respect to all the, trials, and labors, and
        difficulties that must be encountered before we obtain its object. Since
        we hope for what we see not, — that is, for what we possess not, — there
        must consequently be a virtue by which, being held firm, we wait for it,
        and that is patience. For between hope and enjoyment of the thing hoped
        for a delay intervenes, and there are many temptations within, and
        afflictions from without, by which hope would be turned into despair, if
        it were not supported by patience. As long as hope prevails, the combat
        will not be given up. In the 23rd verse, believers are said to be
        waiting for the adoption; here the inducement to their waiting, and
        patiently waiting, is stated, — it is their hope supported by patience.
        Patiently bearing their present burden, and waiting for heaven, implies
        their expectation that it is reserved for them. They have been begotten
        again to a lively hope of possessing it by the resurrection of Jesus
        Christ from the dead, which is a sure pledge of the redemption of their
        bodies from the grave. This verse and the preceding teach the importance
        of hope to believers, and of their obeying the exhortation to give all
        diligence to the full assurance of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hope of beholding Jesus as he is, and of obtaining ‘a better
        resurrection,’ is calculated to enable them patiently to sustain the
        sufferings of the present time. This hope is represented as encouraging
        the Lord Himself, ‘who for the joy that was set before Him endured the
        cross, despising the shame,’ Hebrews 12:2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know
        not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh
        intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers have need of patience, that, after they have done the will of
        God, they may receive the promise; but their patience is not perfect as
        it ought to be, and they are often ready to cast away their confidence,
        although it hath great recompense of reward. For their support, then, in
        their warfare, which is attended with so much difficulty, the Apostle
        presents a variety of considerations. He had reminded them, in the 17th
        verse, of their communion with Jesus Christ, and that, if they suffer
        with Him, they shall with Him also be glorified. In the 18th verse, he
        had told them that their sufferings bear no proportion to that glory of
        which they shall be made partakers. He had next drawn an argument, from
        the present state of creation, suffering, but waiting for and expecting
        its deliverance, and the manifestation of the sons of God; and reminding
        them of the pledges they had already received of that glorious
        manifestation, he had spoken of its certainty, although still future,
        and therefore as yet enjoyed only in hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as they might still object, How, even admitting the force of these
        encouragements, can we, who are so weak in ourselves, and so inferior in
        power to the enemies we have to encounter, bear up under so many trials?
        the Apostle, in the verse before us, points out an additional and
        internal source of encouragement of the highest consideration, namely,
        that the Holy spirit helps their infirmities, and also prays for them,
        which is sufficient to allay every desponding fear, and to communicate
        the strongest consolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the close of the sacred canon, the Church is represented as saying,
        ‘Come, Lord Jesus.’ Being a stranger on earth, and her felicity
        consisting in communion with her glorious Lord, she groans on account of
        His absence, and ardently desires His holy and blessed presence. In the
        meantime, however, He vouchsafes to His people great consolation to
        compensate for His absence. He assures them that He has ascended to His
        Father and their Father, to His God and their God; that in His Father’s
        house are many mansions; that He is gone to prepare a place for them;
        and that, when He has prepared a place He will return and receive them
        to Himself, that where He is they may be also. They also know the way,
        He Himself being the way and their guide. How encouraging is this
        doctrine, and how well calculated for the support of hope and patience
        in expecting the return of the Bridegroom! If He is gone to their common
        Father, communion in His glory will not long be delayed. If there be
        many mansions in the house of their Heavenly Father, these are prepared
        to receive not only the elder Brother, but all His brethren; for were
        there only one abode, it would be for Him alone. If He is gone to
        prepare a place, and if He is soon to come again to receive them to
        Himself, is it not calculated to fill them with joy in the midst of
        troubles and afflictions? But all these consolations would be
        insufficient unless Jesus had added, that He would not leave them
        orphans, but would give them another Comforter to abide with them for
        ever, even the Spirit of truth. Without such support they would be
        overwhelmed by the weight of their afflictions, and overcome by their
        manifold temptations. But since they have not only an almighty Surety,
        but also an almighty Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, who dwells in
        them, and abides with them, this is sufficient to confirm their joy, to
        establish their hope, and to give them the assurance that nothing shall
        separate them from the love of Christ. Such is the consolation, in
        addition to all the others which, in the passage before us, the Apostle
        presents. Likewise the Spirits also helpeth our infirmities. — Likewise,
        or in like manner, as we are supported by hope, so the Spirit also helps
        our infirmities. The expression helpeth our infirmities, is very
        significant. The Apostle intends to say that the Holy Spirit carries, or
        bears with us, our afflictions. If it be inquired why this help which we
        received from the Holy Spirit is distinguished from the support we have
        from hope and patience, the answer is, that the Holy Spirit supports us,
        as being the efficient principle and first cause; and hope and patience
        supports as His instruments. On this account the Apostle, after having
        referred to the two former, speaks of this support of the Spirit. And
        here we find the most abundant consolation in Him who is the promised
        Comforter, for the all-powerful God Himself comes to help our
        infirmities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul does not say infirmity, but infirmities, that we may remember how
        numerous they are, and may humble ourselves before God, renouncing our
        pride and presumption, and imploring His support. He also says, our
        infirmities, thus recognizing them as also his own, and reminding the
        strongest of their weakness. The burdens of believers are of two kinds:
        the one is sin, the other is suffering. Under both of these they are
        supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to sin, Jesus has charged Himself with it. ‘He bore our sins in His
        own body on the tree;’ and as to sufferings, they are helped by the Holy
        Spirit, but only in part, by imparting strength to bear them; for all
        Christians must bear their cross in following Jesus. But in the kingdom
        of heaven, where every tear shall be wiped from their eyes, they shall
        be for ever delivered from all suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians have at present many infirmities; they are in themselves
        altogether weakness; but the Holy Spirit dwells in their hearts, and is
        their strong consolation. Without Him they could not bear their trials,
        or perform what they are called to endure. But as He dwells in them, He
        gives them that aid of which they stand in need. Are we weak, and our
        troubles great? Here the almighty God comes to support us. Are we bowed
        down under the weight of our afflictions? Behold, He who is all-powerful
        bears them with us! The care of shepherds over their flocks, and the
        care of mothers who carry their infants in their bosoms, are but feeble
        images of the love of God and the care He exercises over His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mother may forsake her sucking child, but the Lord will not forsake
        His children. ‘When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord
        will take me up.’ For we know not what we should pray for as we ought;
        but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which
        cannot be uttered. — There are two things in prayer: namely, the matter
        of prayer, that is, the things we ask for, and the act of prayer, by
        which we address God respecting our desires and necessities. But so
        great is the infirmity and ignorance of the believer, that he does not
        even know what he ought to ask. He is not thoroughly acquainted either
        with his dangers or his wants.
      </p>
      <p>
        He needs not only to be supplied from on high, but also Divine guidance
        to show him what he wants. When he knows not what to ask, the office of
        the Holy Spirit in the heart is to assist him in praying. Though, in a
        peculiar sense, Jesus is the believer’s intercessor in heaven, yet the
        Holy Spirit intercedes in him on earth, teaching him what to ask, and
        exciting in him groanings expressive of his wants, though they cannot be
        uttered; that is, they cannot be expressed in words. Yet these wants are
        uttered in groans, and in this manner most emphatically express what is
        meant, while they indicate the energy of the operation of the Spirit.
        Here the Apostle goes farther than in the former clause of the verse,
        and shows that the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by referring to a
        particular example of this aid. In order to prove the extent of our
        weakness, the importance of the help of the Holy Spirit, and the
        greatness of the assistance He gives, Paul declares that we know not
        what we should pray for as we ought. Our blindness and natural ignorance
        are such, that we know not how to make a proper choice of the things for
        which we ought to pray. Sometimes we are ready to ask what is not
        suitable, as when Moses prayed to be allowed to enter Canaan, although,
        as being a type of Christ, he must die before the people, for whom he
        was the mediator, could enter the promised land; and as Paul, when He
        prayed to be delivered from the thorn in his flesh, not understanding
        that it was proper that he should be thus afflicted, that he might not
        be exalted above measure. Sometimes, too, we ask even for things that
        would be hurtful were we to receive them; of which there are many
        examples in Scripture, as James 4:3.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people of God are often so much oppressed, and experience such
        anguish of mind, that their agitated spirits, borne down by affliction,
        can neither perfectly conceive nor properly express their complaints and
        requests to God. Shall they then remain without prayer? No; the Holy
        Spirit acts in their hearts, exciting in them sighs and groans. Such
        appear to have been the groanings of Hezekiah, when he said, ‘Like a
        crane or a swallow, so did I chatter; I did mourn as a dove; mine eyes
        fail with looking upward; O Lords I am oppressed, undertake for me.’
        Such also was the experience of David in the <197701> seventy-seventh
        Psalm, when he says, ‘I am so troubled that I cannot speak.’ Thus, too,
        Hannah ‘space in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not
        heard.’ No words of Peter in his repentance are recorded; his groanings
        are represented by his weeping bitterly; and in the same way we read of
        the woman who was a sinner as only washing the feet of Jesus with her
        tears, which expressed the inward groanings of her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these sightings or groanings of the children of God are here
        ascribed to the Holy spirit, it is not to be supposed that the Divine
        Spirit can be subject to such emotions or perturbations of mind; but it
        is so represented, because He: draws forth these groans from our hearts
        and excites them there. Thus it is for hearts that groan, but the
        operation and emotion is from the Holy Spirit; for the subject of these,
        and He who produces them, must not be confounded. In this way the
        Apostle speaks in the fourth chapter to the Galatians. ‘Because ye are
        sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,
        crying, Abba, Father.’ And in the 15th verse of the chapter before us,
        he shows that it is we who cry ‘Abba, Father,’ in order that we may
        observe that it is not the Spirit who cries, who prays, who groans, but
        that He causes us to cry, and pray, and groan. Such, then, is the work
        of the Holy Spirit here spoken of in the heart of believers, from which
        we learn that if there be any force in us to resist evil, and to
        overcome temptation, it is not of ourselves, but of our God. And hence
        it follows that if we have borne up under any affliction or temptation,
        we ought to render thanks to God, seeing that by His power He has
        supported us, and to pray, as David did, ‘Uphold me with Thy free
        Spirit.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit often, in a peculiar manner, helpeth the infirmities of
        the children of God in the article of death enabling them to sustain the
        pains and weaknesses of their bodies, and supporting their souls by His
        consolations in that trying hour. The body is then borne down with
        trouble, but the mind is sustained by the consolations of God. The eye
        of the body is dim, but the eye of faith is often at that season most
        unclouded. The outward man perisheth, but the inward man is renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, when Satan makes his last and greatest effort to subvert the soul,
        and comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard
        against him, exciting in the believer a more ardent faith, and consoling
        him, though unable to express it, with a strong conviction of the Divine
        love and faithfulness. It is by this means that so many martyrs have
        triumphantly died, surmounting, by the power of the Spirit within them,
        the apprehension of the most excruciating bodily torture, and rejoicing
        in the midst of their sufferings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 27. — And He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
        the Spirit, because He maketh intercession for the saints according to
        the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be objected, To what purpose are those groanings which we
        cannot understand? To this the Apostle very fully replies in this verse,
        — 1. God knows what these prayers mean, for ‘He searcheth the hearts’ of
        men, of which he hath perfect knowledge. The believer sighs and groans,
        while, owing to his perplexity and distress, he cannot utter a word
        before God; nevertheless these sighs and groanings are full of meaning.
        2. God knoweth what is ‘the mind of the Spirit,’ or what He is dictating
        in the heart, and therefore He must approve of it; for the Father and
        Spirit are one. 3. Because, or rather, ‘that He maketh intercession.’ We
        are not to understand His intercession as the reason why God knows the
        mind of the Spirit, but as the reason why He will hear and answer the
        groans which the Holy Spirit excites. A further reason is, that this
        intercession is made for the saints; that is, for the children of God,
        of whom He hath said, ‘Gather My saints together unto Me, those that
        have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice,’ Psalm 1:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it is added, that it is ‘according to God,’ or to the will of
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        These prayers, then, will be heard, because the Spirit intercedes for
        those who are the children of God, and because He excites no desires but
        what are agreeable to the will of God. From all this we see how certain
        it is that these groanings which cannot be uttered must be heard, and
        consequently answered. For ‘this is the confidence that we have in Him,
        that if we ask anything according to His will He heareth us.’ The best
        prayers are not those of human eloquence, but which spring from earnest
        desires of the heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse is replete with instruction as well as consolation. We are
        here reminded that the Lord is the searcher of hearts. ‘Hell and
        destruction are before the Lord; how much more then the hearts of the
        children of men.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasons of the perfect knowledge that God has of our hearts, are
        declared in the <19D901> 139th Psalm: — 1. The infinity, the
        omnipresence, and omniscience of God. 2. He forms the heart, and knows
        His own work. 3. He preserves and maintains the heart in all its
        operations. 4. He conducts and leads it, and therefore knows and sees
        it. The prayer of the heart, then, is attended to by God, as well as the
        prayer of the lips. Yet this does not prove that oral prayer is
        unnecessary — not even in our secret devotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage teaches us to look to God for an answer to the secret
        groanings of our heart; but it does not teach us to neglect communing
        with God with our lips, when we can express our thoughts. This is
        abundantly taught in the word of God, both by precept and example.
        Searching the heart is here given as a characteristic peculiar to God.
        As, then, it is ascribed in other passages to our Lord Jesus Christ, He
        must be God. This passage clearly establishes the personal distinction
        between the Father and the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The persons to whom the benefit of this intercession of the Spirit
        extends are said to be saints This proves that none can pray truly and
        effectually except the saints. It is only in the saints that the Spirit
        dwells, and of whose prayers He is the Author; and it is they only who
        are sanctified by Him. It is the saints, then, emphatically, and the
        saints exclusively, for whom the Spirit makes intercession. Such only
        are accepted of God, and fit subjects for the operation of the Spirit;
        but this is not the first work of the Spirit in them. He first
        sanctifies and then intercedes. First, He puts into us gracious
        dispositions, and then stirs up holy desires; and the latter supposes
        the former. In those in whom the Spirit is a Spirit of intercession, in
        them He is a Spirit of regeneration. These are therefore joined together
        in Zechariah 12:10, ‘The Spirit of grace and of supplications.’ None but
        saints have an interest in the blood of Christ, as applied unto them,
        and in His intercession. None are able to pray for themselves, for whom
        Christ does not likewise pray. We can only approach God by the Spirit.
        ‘We have access by one Spirit to the Father,’ Ephesians 2:18. We can
        only pray under the influence of the Holy Spirit with groanings which
        cannot be uttered; while the wicked may groan without prayer. ‘They have
        not cried unto Me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds,’
        Hosea 7:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other reason which renders acceptable to God the prayers and sighs
        excited in the saints by the Holy Spirit, is, that they are according to
        the will of God. The Spirit Himself being God, these requests must be
        agreeable to God. The carnal mind, it is said in verse 7, is enmity
        against God; but the mind (the same word here employed) of the Spirit is
        agreeable to God. The intercession made by the Holy Spirit is according
        to the command and the revealed will of God, and in the name and in
        dependence on Christ the Mediator. The Holy Spirit, then, teaches the
        saints how to pray, and what to pray for. What He teaches them to ask on
        earth, is in exact correspondence with that for which Jesus, their great
        High Priest, is interceding for them in heaven. The intercession of
        Jesus before the throne is an echo to the prayer taught by the Holy
        Spirit in their hearts. It is therefore not only in perfect unison with
        the intercession of Christ, and the indicting of the Holy Spirit, but it
        is in exact conformity to the will of God. Such, then, is the security
        to the saints that their prayers, although only expressed in groans,
        shall be heard by their Father in heaven. ‘The prayer of the upright is
        His delight,’ Proverbs 15:8. ‘He will fulfill the desire of them that
        fear Him,’ <19E519> Psalm 145:19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — And we know that all things work together for good to them
        that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing is more necessary for Christians than to be well persuaded of
        the happiness and privileges of their condition, that they may be able
        to serve God with cheerfulness and freedom of spirit, and to pass
        through the troubles and difficulties of the world. Here, then, is
        further consolation:
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians are often in sorrows, sufferings, and trials. This is not in
        itself joyous, but grievous; but in another point of view it is a matter
        of joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though afflictions in themselves are evil, yet in their effects as
        overruled and directed by God, they are useful. Yea, all things, of
        every kind, that happen to the Christian, are overruled by God for his
        good!
      </p>
      <p>
        Having previously spoken of the various sources of consolation, and, in
        the two preceding verses, of the Spirit helping our infirmities, and
        dictating those prayers which are heard of God, the Apostle now obviates
        another objection. If God hears our sighs and groanings, why are we not
        delivered from our afflictions and troubles? In answer, it is here shown
        that afflictions are salutary and profitable; so that, although they are
        not removed, God changes their natural tendency, and makes them work for
        our good. But in order that none should hereby be led into carnal
        security, the Apostle adds, that those for whom all things work together
        for good are such as love God, and are the called according to His
        purpose. This is not only true in itself, but it is here asserted to be
        a truth known to believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had proposed various considerations, to which he now says we
        know this is to be added. This does not mean that believers know it
        merely in a speculative manner, but that it is a knowledge which enters
        into their heart and affections, producing in them confidence in its
        truth. It is a knowledge of faith which implies certainty and self
        application, by which the believer not only knows but applies the
        promises of God, and is able to say, This promise is mine, it belongs to
        me. For otherwise, what advantage would there be in a general knowledge
        of this fact? where would be its consolation, and where its practical
        use? ‘The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will
        show them His covenant.’ The experience, too, of the believer brings
        home to his mind the conviction of this encouraging truth. The Church of
        Rome accuses of presumption those who make such an application to
        themselves. They allow that the Christian should believe, in general,
        the promises of God, but that, as to a particular self-application or
        appropriation of them, he should hold this in doubt, and be always
        uncertain as to his own salvation. This is to destroy the nature of
        those consolations, and to render them useless. For if, in order to
        console one who is afflicted, it be said to him, ‘All things work
        together for good to them that love God,’ he will answer, True, but I
        must doubt whether this belongs to me; and thus the consolation is made
        of no effect. But if this error be not imbibed, and the duty of such
        appropriation be not denied, why is it that so many believers experience
        so little of this consolation in their afflictions? Is it not because
        they have little of that knowledge of which the Apostle speaks when he
        says, ‘We know that all things work together for good to them that love
        God?’ Carnal affections, the love of the world, and indulgence of the
        flesh, prevent this consideration from being deeply impressed on their
        minds; they also darken their understandings, so as not to allow the
        light of the consolations of God to enter their hearts. But in
        proportion as their hearts are purified from these affections, in the
        same degree it is confirmed in their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objection, why sufferings are not removed, should be answered by
        reminding believers that all things work together for their good. All
        things work together for good to them that love God. — All things,
        whatever they be — all things indefinitely — are here intended. The
        extent of this expression is by many limited to afflictions. ‘Paul, it
        must be remembered,’ says Calvin on this text, ‘is speaking only of
        adversity;’ and he adds, ‘Paul is here speaking of the cross; and on
        this account the observation of Augustine, though true, does not bear on
        this passage — that even the sins of believers are so ordered by the
        providence of God as to serve rather to the advancement of their
        salvation than to their injury.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is true that the Apostle had been referring to the present sufferings
        of believers, and enumerating various special topics of consolation;
        but, approaching to the conclusion of his enumeration, it might be
        expected that the last of them would be no longer of a special but of a
        most comprehensive description. That it is so, the terms he employs
        warrant us to conclude. All things, he says. If the context necessarily
        limited this expression, its universality ought not to be contended for;
        but it does not If it be, as Calvin admits, that what is here said is
        true even of the sins of believers (and if applicable to sins, what else
        can be excepted?), why should the sense be limited to sufferings It is
        much more consolatory, and consequently more to the Apostle’s purpose,
        if literally all things be comprehended; and in this view it would form
        the most complete summing up of his subject. He had been pointing out to
        believers their high privileges as heirs of God, and partakers of glory
        with Christ. He had said that their sufferings in the present time are
        not worthy to be compared with that glory. He had suggested various
        topics to induce them to wait for it with patience; and had given them
        the highest encouragement, from the fact of the working of the Spirit of
        all grace within them, and of the acceptance of that work by God. Is it
        then more than was to be expected, that he should conclude the whole by
        saying that all things, without exception, were concurring for their
        good? Is it too much to suppose that it must be so to them whom he had
        addressed as heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, who are
        therefore under the guidance of the Good Shepherd, and honored by the
        indwelling of the Holy Ghost? Is it more than the Apostle says on
        another occasion, when he uses the very same expression, all things,
        and, so far from intimating any exception, adds a most comprehensive
        catalogue? ‘All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas,
        or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come;
        all are yours, for ye are Christ’s and Christ is God’s,’ Corinthians
        3:21. And again, ‘All things are for your sakes,’ Corinthians 4:15.
        Finally, ought the expression here to be restricted, when it is
        impossible to believe that the same expression, occurring a few
        sentences afterwards, verse 32, can be restricted? That all things work
        together for the good of them that love God, is a truth affording the
        highest consolation. These words teach believers that whatever may be
        the number and overwhelming character of adverse circumstances, they are
        all contributing to conduct them into the possession of the inheritance
        provided for them in heaven. That they are thus working for the good of
        the children of God, is manifest from the consideration that God governs
        the world. The first cause of all is God; second causes are all His
        creatures, whether angels, good or bad men, animals, or the inanimate
        creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second causes move only under His direction; and when God withdraws His
        hand, they cannot more at all, as it is written, ‘In Him we live, and
        move, and have our being.’ As God, then, the first cause, moves all
        second causes against His enemies, so, when He is favorable to us, He
        employs all to move and work for our good, as it is said, ‘In that day
        will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with
        the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and
        will break the bow, and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and
        will make them to lie down safely,’ Hosea 2:18. And as of men it is
        said, ‘When a man’s ways please the Lord, He maketh even his enemies-to
        be at peace with him,’ Proverbs 16:7.
      </p>
      <p>
        If all things work together for good, there is nothing within the
        compass of being that is not, in one way or other, advantageous to the
        children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the attributes of God, all the offices of Christ, all the gifts and
        graces of the Holy Spirit, are combined for their good. The creation of
        the world, the fall and the redemption of man, all the dispensations of
        Providence, whether prosperous or adverse, all occurrences and events —
        all things, whatsoever they be — work for their good. They work together
        in their efficacy, in their unity, and in their connection. They do not
        work thus of themselves: it is God that turns all things to the good of
        His children. The afflictions of believers, in a peculiar manner,
        contribute to this end. ‘Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now
        have I kept Thy word. It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that
        I might learn Thy statutes.’ ‘Tribulation worketh patience.’ ‘No
        chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous;
        nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
        Unto them which are exercised thereby.’ And believers are chastened by
        God for their profit, that they may be partakers of His holiness. The
        Apostle himself was an example of this, when a thorn in his flesh was
        sent to him to prevent his being exalted above measure. We see how much
        the sufferings of those spoken of in the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews
        were calculated to detach their affections from this present world, and
        lead them to seek a better, even a heavenly country. There is often a
        need be for their being in heaviness through manifold temptations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the sins of believers work for their good, not from the nature of
        sin, but by the goodness and power of Him who brings light out of
        darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everywhere in Scripture we read of the great evil of sin. Everywhere we
        receive the most solemn warning against its commission; and everywhere
        we hear also of the chastisements it brings, even upon those who are
        rescued from its finally condemning power. It is not sin, then, in
        itself that works the good, but God who overrules its effects to His
        children, — shows them, by means of it, what is in their hearts, as well
        as their entire dependence on Himself, and the necessity of walking with
        Him more closely. Their falls lead them to humiliation, to the
        acknowledgment of their weakness and depravity, to prayer for the
        guidance and overpowering influence of the Holy Spirit, to vigilance and
        caution against all carnal security, and to reliance on that
        righteousness provided for their appearance before God. It is evident
        that the sin of Adam, which is the source of all their sins, has wrought
        for their good in raising them to a higher degree of glory. Believers
        fall into sin, and on account of this God hides His face from them, and
        they are troubled; and, like Hezekiah, they go softly. God left Hezekiah
        to himself, but it was to do him good at his latter end.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if our sins work together for our good, shall we sin that grace may
        abound? Far be the thought. This would be entirely to misunderstand the
        grace of God, and to turn it into an occasion of offending Him. Against
        such an abuse of the doctrine of grace, the Apostle contends in the 6th
        chapter of this Epistle. Sin should be considered in its nature, not as
        to what it is adventitiously, or in respect to what is foreign to it.
        Sin as committed by us is only sin, and rebellion against God and the
        holiness of His nature. It ought therefore to be regarded with
        abhorrence, and merits eternal punishment. That it is turned to good, is
        the world of God, and not ours. We ought no more to conclude that on
        this account we may sin, than that wicked men do what is right when they
        persecute the people of God, because persecutions are overruled by Him
        for good. That all things work together for good to them who love God,
        establishes the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints; for if all
        things work together for their good, what or where is that which God
        will permit to lead them into condemnation?
      </p>
      <p>
        That all things happen for the best is a common saying among people of
        the world. This is a fact as to the final issue of the Divine
        administration, by which all things shall be made to contribute to the
        glory of God. But as to sinners individually, the reverse is true. All
        things are indeed working together in one complex plan in the providence
        of God for the good of those who love Him; but so far from working for
        good, or for the best to His enemies, everything is working to their
        final ruin. Both of these effects are remarkably exemplified in the
        lives of Saul and David. Even the aggravated sin of David led him to
        deep humiliation and godly sorrow, to a greater knowledge of his natural
        and original depravity, of the deceitfulness of his heart, and to his
        singing aloud of God’s righteousness. The sins of Saul, as well as
        everything that befell him in God’s providence, led to his becoming more
        hardened in his impiety, and at last conducted him to despair and
        suicide. The histories of many others, both believers and sinners,
        recorded in the Old Testament, abundantly confirm the words of the
        Psalmist, ‘The Lord preserveth all them that love Him, but all the
        wicked will be destroyed.’ ‘The way of the wicked He turneth upside
        down.’
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two scriptures which should fill the people of God with joy
        and consolation. The one is, ‘The Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord
        will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from them that
        love Him,’ Psalm 84:11. The other is the passage before us, ‘All things
        work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
        according to His purpose.’ If, then, God will withhold nothing that is
        good for us, and will order and dispose of all things for good to us,
        what can be wanting to our absolute and complete security? How admirable
        is the providence of God, not only as all things are ordered by Him, but
        as He overrules whatever is most disordered, and turns to good things
        that in themselves are most pernicious. We admire His providence in the
        regularity of the seasons, of the course of the sun and stars; but this
        is not so wonderful as His bringing good out of evil in all the
        complicated acts and occurrences in the lives of men, and making even
        the power and malice of Satan, with the naturally destructive tendency
        of his works, to minister to the good of His children. That love God. —
        What is said of all things working together for good is here limited to
        those who love God. This is given as a peculiar characteristic of a
        Christian. It imports that all behaviors love God, and that none but
        believers love Him. Philosophers, falsely so called, and men of various
        descriptions, may boast of loving God; but the decision of God Himself
        is, that to love Him is the peculiar characteristic of a Christian. No
        man can love God till He hath shined into his heart to give him the
        light of the knowledge of His glory in the face of Jesus Christ. It is
        therefore only through faith in the blood of Christ that we can love
        God. Until our faith gives us some assurance of reconciliation with God,
        we cannot have the confidence which is essential to loving God. Till
        then we dread God as our enemy, and fear that He will punish us for our
        sins. In loving God, the affections of the believer terminate in God as
        their last and highest end; and this they can do in God only. In
        everything else, there being only a finite goodness, we cannot
        absolutely rest in it. This is the rest that David had when he said,
        ‘Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I
        desire besides Thee; God is the strength of my heart and my portion for
        ever,’ Psalm 73:25. This is what satisfies the believer in his need and
        poverty, and in every situation in which he may be placed, for it
        suffices him to have God for his heritage and his possession, since God
        is his all; and as this Divine love expels the love of the world, so it
        overcomes the immoderate love of himself. He is led to love what God
        loves, and to hate what God hates, and thus he walks in communion with
        God, loving God, and more and more desiring to comprehend what is the
        breadth and length, and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ
        which passeth knowledge. To those who are the called according to His
        purpose. — This is a further description or characteristic of God’s
        people. They are called not merely outwardly by the preaching of the
        Gospel, for this is common to them with unbelievers, but called also by
        the Spirit, with an internal and effectual calling, and made willing in
        the day of God’s power. They are called according to God’s eternal
        purpose, according to which He knew them, and purposed their calling
        before they were in existence; for all God’s purposes are eternal. It
        imports that their calling is solely the effect of grace; for when it is
        said to be a calling according to God’s purpose, it is distinguished
        from a calling according to works. ‘Who hath saved us, and called us
        with an holy calling, not according to our works but according to His
        own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
        world began,’ 2 Timothy 1:9. It imports that it is an effectual and
        permanent calling; for God’s purposes cannot be defeated. ‘The counsel
        of the Lord, that shall stand.’ Their calling is according to the
        purpose of Him who worketh all things according to the counsel of His
        own will,’ Ephesians 1:11.

        Ver. 29. — For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
        conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
        many brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle having exhibited to believers many grounds of consolation,
        to induce them patiently to endure the sufferings of this present time,
        now points to the source of their future glory, in order to assure them
        of its certainty. The easy and natural transition to this branch of his
        subject should be particularly noticed. He had declared in the foregoing
        verse that all things work together for good to them who love God; but
        as it is always necessary to keep in mind that our love to God is not
        the cause of His love to us, nor, consequently, of the privileges with
        which we are favored, but the effects of His loving us, Deuteronomy
        7:6-8; Jeremiah 1:5, the Apostle adds, ‘Who are the called according to
        His purpose.’ This declaration leads at once to a full and most
        encouraging view of the progress of the Divine procedure originating
        with God, and carried, through all its connecting links, forward to the
        full possession of that glory which shall be revealed in us. For whom He
        did foreknow. — The word foreknow has three significations. One is
        general, importing simply a knowledge of things before they come into
        existence. In this general sense it is evident that it is not employed
        in this passage, since it is limited to those whom God predestinated to
        be conformed to the image of His Son. He foreknows all things before
        they come to pass; but here foreknowledge refers only to particular
        individuals. A second signification is a knowledge accompanied by a
        decree. In this sense it signifies ordinance and providence, as it is
        said, Acts 2:23, ‘Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge of God;’ that is to say, by the ordinance and providence
        of God. The reason why this word is used to denote the Divine
        determinations is because the foreknowledge of God necessarily implies
        His purpose or decree with respect to the thing foreknown. For God
        foreknows what will be, by determining what shall be. God’s
        foreknowledge cannot in itself be the cause of any event; but events
        must be produced by His decree and ordination. It is not because God
        foresees a thing that it is decreed; but He foresees it because it is
        ordained by Him to happen in the order of His providence. Therefore His
        foreknowledge and decrees cannot be separated; for the one implies the
        other. When He decrees that a thing shall be, He foresees that it will
        be. There is nothing known as what will be, which is not certainly to
        be; and there is nothing certainly to be, unless it is ordained that it
        shall be. All the foreknowledge of future events, then, is founded on
        the decree of God; consequently He determined with Himself from eternity
        everything He executes in time, Acts 15:18. Nothing is contingent in the
        mind of God, who foresees and orders all events according to His own
        eternal and unchangeable will. Jesus Christ was not delivered by God
        fore knowing it before it took place, but by His fixed counsel and
        ordination, or His providence. Thus believers are called elect according
        to the foreknowledge of God the Father, 1 Peter 1:2; and in the same
        chapter, ver. 19, 20, the Apostle Peter says that Jesus Christ was
        foreknown before the foundation of the world. Here foreknown signifies,
        as it is rendered, fore-ordained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third signification of this word consists in a knowledge of love and
        approbation; and in this sense it signifies to choose and recognize as
        His own, as it is said, Romans 11:2, ‘God hath not cast away His people
        whom He foreknew,’ — that is, whom He had before loved and chosen; for
        the Apostle alleges this foreknowledge as the reason why God had not
        rejected His people. In this manner the word ‘know’ is often taken in
        Scripture in the sense of knowing with affection, loving, approving; as
        in the first Psalm, ‘The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the
        way of the ungodly shall perish.’ To know the way of the just, is to
        love, to approve, as appears by the antithesis. Paul says to the
        Corinthians, ‘If any man love God, the same is know of Him,’ 1
        Corinthians 8:3; and to the Galatians, ‘But now after ye have known God
        or rather are known of Him.’ In the same way, God said by His Prophet to
        Israel, ‘You only have I known of all the families of the earth,’ Amos
        3:2. At the day of judgment Jesus Christ will say to hypocrites, ‘I
        never knew you,’ Matthew 7:23; that is to say, He never loved or
        acknowledged them, although He perfectly knew their characters and
        actions. In this last sense the word foreknow is employed in the passage
        before us. Those whom God foreknew — those whom He before loved, chose,
        acknowledged as His own — He predestinated to be conformed to the image
        of His Son It is not a general anticipated knowledge that is here
        intended. The Apostle does not speak of all, but of some, whom in verse
        33 he calls ‘God’s elect;’ and not of anything in their persons, or
        belonging to them, but of the persons themselves, whom it is said God
        foreknew. And He adds, that those whom He foreknew He also did
        predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son; and whom he
        predestinated He also called, and justified, and glorified.
      </p>
      <p>
        By foreknowledge, then, is not here meant a foreknowledge of faith or
        good works, or of concurrence with the external call Faith cannot be the
        cause of foreknowledge, because foreknowledge is before predestination,
        and faith is the effect of predestination. ‘As many as were ordained to
        eternal life believed,’ Acts 13:48. Neither can it be meant of the
        foreknowledge of good works, because these are the effects of
        predestination. ‘We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto
        good works; which God hath before ordained (or before prepared) that we
        should walk in them,’ Ephesians 2:10. Neither can it be meant of
        foreknowledge of our concurrence with the external call, because our
        effectual calling depends not upon that concurrence, but upon God’s
        purpose and grace, given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
        Timothy 1:9. By this foreknowledge, then, is meant, as has been
        observed, the love of God towards those whom He predestinates to be
        saved through Jesus Christ. All the called of God are foreknown by Him,
        — that is, they are the objects of His eternal love, and their calling
        comes from this free love. ‘I have loved thee with an everlasting love;
        therefore with loving-kindness I have drawn thee,’ Jeremiah 31:3. He
        also did predestinate. — Foreknowledge and predestination are
        distinguished. The one is the choice of persons, the other the
        destination of those persons to the blessings for which they are
        designed. To predestinate signifies to appoint beforehand to some
        particular end. In Scripture it is taken sometimes generally for any
        decree of God, as in Acts 4:28, where the Apostles say that the Jews
        were assembled to do whatsoever the hand and the counsel of God had
        determined (predestinated) before to be done. And Paul says, 1
        Corinthians 2:7, ‘We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
        hidden wisdom which God ordained (predestinated) before the world unto
        our glory.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes this word is taken specially for the decree of the salvation
        of man, as Ephesians 1:5, ‘Having predestinated us unto the adoption of
        children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of
        His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace.’ In whom also we have
        obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of
        Him who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will.’ In the
        same way, in the passage before us, ‘Whom He did foreknow, He also did
        predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son.’ As the term is
        here used, it respects not all men, but only those of whom God has
        placed His love from eternity, and on whom He purposes to bestow life
        through Jesus Christ. As, then, it is absolute and complete, so it is
        definite; and the number who are thus predestinated can neither be
        increased nor diminished. It is not that God had foreseen us as being in
        Christ Jesus by faith, and on that account had elected us, but that
        Jesus Christ, being the Mediator between God and man, God had
        predestinated us to salvation only in Him. For as the union which we
        have with Him is the foundation of all the good which we receive from
        God, so we must be elected in Him; that is to say, that God gives us to
        Him to be His members, and to partake in the good things to which God
        predestinates us. So that Jesus Christ has been the first predestinated
        and appointed to be the Mediator, in order that God should bless us with
        all spiritual blessings in Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the passage above quoted, Ephesians 1:5, the cause of predestination
        is traced solely to God. After saying that God had predestinated us unto
        the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, it is added, ‘to Himself,’ to
        show that God has no cause out of Himself moving Him to this grace. In
        order to enforce this, it is further added, ‘according to the good
        pleasure of His will;’ and, in the third place, it is subjoined, ‘to the
        praise of the glory of His grace;’ from all which it follows that it
        must necessarily be by grace, — that is, free, unmerited favor. Love to
        God, or conformity to the image of Christ, cannot in any respect have
        its origin in fallen man. ‘Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
        that He loved us.’ ‘We love Him, because He first loved us.’ ‘It is a
        foolish inference,’ says Calvin, ‘of these disputants, who say that God
        has elected such only as He foresaw would be worthy of grace. For Peter
        does not flatter believers, as if they were elected for their own
        individual merits, but refers their election to the eternal counsel of
        God, and strips them of all worthiness. In this passage, also, Paul
        repeats in another word what he had lately intimated concerning God’s
        eternal purpose; and it hence follows that this knowledge depends on the
        good pleasure of His will, because, by adopting whom He would, God did
        not extend His foreknowledge to anything out of Himself, but only marked
        out those whom He intended to elect.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of predestination is Jesus Christ, by whom we receive the
        adoption of children. Its object is man, not invested with any quality
        which moves God to predestinate him, but as corrupted and guilty in Adam
        — dead in trespasses and sins until quickened by God. The blessing to
        which God had predestinated those whom He foreknew is salvation, as it
        is said, ‘God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
        our Lord Jesus Christ;’ or, as it is expressed in the verse before us,
        ‘to be conformed to the image of His Son.’ The means to all this are our
        calling and justification. The final end of predestination is the glory
        of God, — ’to the glory of His grace;’ ‘and that He might make known the
        riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared
        unto glory.’ On the consideration of their election, the Apostles urge
        believers to walk in holiness. ‘Put on, therefore, as the elect of God,
        holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,
        meekness, long-suffering,’ Colossians 3:12. ‘Ye are a chosen (elected)
        generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that
        ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of
        darkness into His marvelous light,’ 1 Peter 2:9.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the election of some, and the passing by of others, the wisdom of God
        is manifest; for by this means He displays both His justice and mercy, —
        otherwise one of these perfections would not have appeared. If all had
        been withdrawn from their state of corruption, the justice of God would
        not have manifested itself in their punishment. If none had been chosen,
        His mercy would not have been seen. In the salvation of these, God has
        displayed His grace; and in the punishment of sin in the others, He has
        discovered His justice and hatred of iniquity. This doctrine of election
        is full of consolation, and is the true source of Christian assurance.
        For who can shake this foundation, which is more firm than that of the
        heavens and the earth, and can no more be shaken than God Himself? The
        sheep whom God hath given to His Son by His predestination no one can
        pluck out of His hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        But although this doctrine of election of the people of God to eternal
        life is a doctrine so consoling to them, and must have necessarily
        entered into the plan of salvation to render it consistent with itself,
        yet there are many who, in preaching the Gospel, deem it improper,
        notwithstanding they have the express example of our Lord, John
        6:37,44,65, to declare it before promiscuous multitudes, or even
        generally to believers, although so frequently introduced by the
        Apostles in their Epistles to the churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Against this practice, prompted by worldly wisdom, Luther has forcibly
        remonstrated in the following appeal to Erasmus: — ’If, my Erasmus, you
        consider these paradoxes (as you term them) to be no more than the
        inventions of men, why are you so extraordinarily heated on the
        occasion?
      </p>
      <p>
        In that case your arguments affect not me; for there is no person now
        living in the world who is a more avowed enemy to the doctrines of men
        than myself. But if you believe the doctrines in debate between us to be
        (as indeed they are) the doctrines of God, you must here bid adieu to
        all sense of shame and decency thus to oppose them. I will not ask,
        whither is the modesty of Erasmus fled? but, which is much more
        important, where, alas! are your fear and reverence of the Deity, when
        you roundly declare that this branch of truth, which He has revealed
        from heaven, is at best useless and unnecessary to know? What! shall the
        glorious Creator be taught by you, His creature, what is fit to be
        preached, and what to be suppressed? Is the adorable God so very
        defective in wisdom and prudence, as not to know, till you instruct Him,
        what would be useful and what pernicious? Or, could not He, whose
        understanding is infinite, foresee, previous to His revelation of this
        doctrine, what would be the consequences of His revealing it, till these
        consequences were pointed out by you? You cannot, you dare not, say
        this. If, then, it was the Divine pleasure to make known these things in
        His word, and to bid His messengers publish them abroad, and to leave
        the consequences of their so doing to the wisdom and providence of Him
        in whose name they speak, and whose message they declare, who art thou,
        O Erasmus, that thou shouldst reply against God?’ To be conformed to the
        image of His Son. — This implies that the children of God must all be
        made to resemble Christ, their head and elder brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        This likeness respects character and suffering, as well as all things in
        which such similarity is found to exist. The Lord Jesus Christ, the
        first elect of God, is the model after which all the elect of God must
        be formed. Man was created in the image of God; but when sin entered, he
        lost this image; and Adam ‘begat a son in his own likeness after his
        image,’ Genesis 5:3; thus communicating to his posterity his corrupted
        nature. But as God had determined to save a part of the fallen race, it
        was ‘according to His good pleasure’ to renew His image in those whom He
        had chosen to this salvation. This was to be accomplished by the
        incarnation of His Son, ‘who is the brightness of His glory, and the
        express image of His person,’ to whose image they were predestinated to
        be conformed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This image of the Son of God, consisting in supernatural, spiritual, and
        celestial qualities, is stamped upon all the children of God when they
        are adopted into His family. Imparting to them spiritual life, He
        renders them partakers of the Divine nature; that is to say, of His
        image, being the new man, which after God is created in righteousness
        and true holiness. They are the workmanship of God, erected in Christ
        Jesus, being born of the Spirit, and the Spirit of Christ dwelling in
        them; and he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit. Thus the souls of
        believers are confirmed to the image of Christ, as their bodies will be
        also at his second coming, when they shall be ‘fashioned like unto His
        glorious body.’ To this conformity to the image of His Son, all those
        whom God foreknew are predestinated. For as they have borne the image of
        the earthy, they shall also bear the image of the heavenly Adam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers are conformed to the image of the Son of God in holiness and
        suffering in this life, and in glory in the life to come. They are
        conformed to Him in holiness, for Christ is made unto them
        sanctification. Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, they are
        changed into the same image.
      </p>
      <p>
        They put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image
        of Him that erected him. In suffering they are conformed to Him who was
        ‘a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.’ They must endure
        tribulation, and fill up what is behind of His affection. As the Captain
        of their salvation was made perfect through sufferings, and through
        sufferings entered into His glory, so the sufferings of His people,
        while they promote their conformity to Him in holiness constitute the
        path in which they follow Him to that glory. ‘Ye are they who have
        continued with Me in My temptations, and I appoint unto you a kingdom.’
        What the Apostle hath said in the 17th verse, that if believers suffer
        with Christ they share also be glorified together, is here confirmed by
        his declaration that they are predestinated to be conformed to His
        image. This image, of which the outlines are in this world traced in
        them, is only perfected in heaven. That He might be the Firstborn among
        many brethren. — Here is a reason for those whom God foreknew being
        conformed to the image of His Son; and a limitation of that conformity
        which they shall have to Him. The reason is, that He might have many
        brethren. Next to the glory of God, the object of His incarnation was
        the salvation of a multitude which no man can number of those whose
        nature He assumed, and this was accomplished by His death. Referring to
        this, He Himself says, ‘Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
        die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.’
        Accordingly, in the everlasting covenant between the Father and the Son,
        when grace was given to His people in Him before the world began, 2
        Timothy 1:9, and when God promised to Him for them eternal life also
        before the world began, Titus 1:2, it was determined that when He should
        make His soul an offering for sin, He should see of the travail of His
        soul and be satisfied, and that by the knowledge of Him many should be
        justified. He was to bear the sins of many. ‘ Glorify Thy Son, that Thy
        Son also may glorify Thee; as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh,
        that He might give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him.’ By
        His obedience many were to be made righteous. As the Captain of their
        salvation, He was to bring many sons unto glory. To Him many shall come
        from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
        Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. ‘The gift by grace which is by one man
        Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many.’ And as He that sanctifieth and
        they who are sanctified are all of one, He is not ashamed to call them
        brethren. But as in all things He must have the pre-eminence, so this
        limitation is introduced, that among them all He must be the
        ‘firstborn;’ that is to say, the first, the principal the most
        excellent, The Governor, the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the law, the firstborn had authority over their brethren, and to
        them belonged a double portion, as well as the honor of acting as
        priests, — the firstborn in Israel being holy, that is to say,
        consecrated to the Lord Reuben, forfeiting his right of primogeniture by
        his sin, its privileges were divided, so that the dominion belonging to
        it was transferred to Judah, and the double portion to Joseph, who had
        two tribes and two portions in Canaan, by Ephraim and Manasseh; while
        the priesthood and right of sacrifice was transferred to Levi. The word
        first to born also signifies what surpasses anything else of the same
        kind, as ‘the firstborn of the poor,’ Isaiah 14:30, that is to say, the
        most miserable of all; and the firstborn of death, Job 18:13, signifying
        a very terrible death, surpassing in grief and violence. The term
        firstborn is also applied to those who were most beloved, as Ephraim is
        called the firstborn of the Lord, Jeremiah 31:9, that is, His ‘dear
        son.’ In all these respects the appellation of firstborn belongs to
        Jesus Christ, both as to the superiority of His nature, of His office,
        and of His glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding His nature, He was as to His divinity truly the firstborn,
        since He alone is the only-begotten — the eternal Son of the Father. In
        this respect He is the Son of God by nature, while His brethren are sons
        of God by grace. In His humanity He was conceived without sin, beloved
        of God; instead of which they are conceived in sin, and are by nature
        children of wrath. In that nature He possessed the Spirit without
        measure; while they receive out of His fullness according to the measure
        of the gift of Christ. Regarding his office, He is their King, their
        Head, their Lord, their Priest, their Prophet, their Surety, their
        Advocate with the Father, — in one word, their Savior. It is He who of
        God is made unto them wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
        redemption. They are all His subjects, whom He leads and governs by His
        Spirit, for whose sins He has made atonement by His sufferings. They are
        His disciples, whom He has called from darkness into His marvelous
        light. Concerning His glory, ‘God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him
        a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee
        should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
        the earth.’ ‘He is the head of the body, the Church; what is the
        beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He might have
        the pre-eminence He is the firstborn from the dead, as being raised the
        first, and being made the first-fruits of them that slept; and by His
        power they shall be raised to a life glorious and eternal.

        Ver. 30. — Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and
        whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He
        also glorified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called — Here the
        Apostle connects our calling, which is known, with God’s decree, which
        is concealed, to teach us that we may judge of our election by our
        calling Peter 1:10. For Paul says, they whom God hath predestinated He
        hath also called and justified; so we may say, those whom He hath called
        and justified He hath elected and predestinated. If God hath called us,
        then He hath elected us. Paul had spoken of God’s predestining His
        people to be conformed to the image of His Son: He now shows us how this
        is effected.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are to be molded into this likeness to their elder Brother by being
        called both by the word and Spirit of God. God calls them by His grace,
        Galatians 1:15, — that is, without regard to anything in themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effectual calling is the first internal operation of grace on those who
        are elected. They are not merely called externally, as many who are not
        elected. The scriptures speak of the universal call of the Gospel,
        addressed to all men; but this is not inseparably connected with
        salvation; for in this sense the Lord has said that ‘many are called,
        but few are chosen.’ At three periods, all mankind were called. They
        were called through Adam; they were called by Noah; and, finally, by the
        Apostles, Colossians 1:23; yet how soon in each period was the external
        call forgotten by the great body of the human race ‘They did not like to
        retain God in their knowledge.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the passage before us, and in various other places, as in verse 28,
        it is effectual calling that is spoken of. This calling, then, signifies
        more than the external calling of the word. It is accompanied with more
        than the partial and temporary effects which the word produces on some,
        and is always ascribed to the operation of God by the influence of the
        Holy Spirit. Even when the external means are employed to most
        advantage, it is God only who gives the increase, 1 Corinthians 3:6. It
        is He who opens the heart to receive the word, Acts 16:14, — who gives a
        new heart, Ezekiel. 36:26, — who writes His law in it, — and who saves
        His people, not by works of righteousness which they have done, but by
        the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, Titus 3:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        That which is meant, then, by the word called in this passage, and in
        many others, is the outward calling by the word accompanied with the
        operation of God, by His Spirit, in the regeneration and conversion of
        sinners. When Jesus Christ thus calls, men instantly believe, Matthew
        4:19. Grace — the operation of the favor of God in the heart — is
        communicated, and the sinner becomes a new creature. Regeneration is not
        a work which is accomplished gradually; it is effected instantaneously.
        At first, indeed, faith is often weak; but as the new-born infant is as
        much in possession of life as the full-grown man, so the spiritual life
        is possessed as completely in the moment of regeneration as ever it is
        afterwards, and previous to that moment it had no existence. There is no
        medium between life and death: a man is either dead in sin, or quickened
        by receiving the Holy Spirit; he is either in Christ, or out of Christ;
        God has either begun a good work in him, or he is in a state of
        spiritual death and corruption. By means of the word, accompanied by His
        Spirit, God enlightens the understanding with a heavenly light, moves
        the will and the affections to receive and embrace Christ, and forms in
        the heart His image and the new man, of which the Apostle says that it
        is created in righteousness and true holiness. God says, ‘Awake, thou
        that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
        light.’ He prophesies upon the dry bones, and the Spirit enters into
        them. Thus the same grace that operates in the election of the saints is
        exercised in their calling and regeneration, without which they would
        remain dead in trespasses and sins. ‘No man,’ says Jesus, ‘can come to
        Me, except the Father which hath sent Me, draw him.’
      </p>
      <p>
        All who are elected are in due time effectually called, and all who are
        effectually called have been from all eternity elected and ordained to
        eternal salvation. Effectual calling, then, is the proper and necessary
        consequence and effect of election, and the means to glorification. As
        those whom God hath predestinated He hath called, so He hath effectually
        called none besides. These words before us, therefore, are to be taken
        not only as emphatical, but as exclusive. Consistently with this, we
        read of the faith of God’s elect, Titus 1:1, as that which is peculiar
        to them. With this calling sanctification is inseparably connected. It
        is denominated a holy calling. ‘Who hath saved us and called us with an
        holy calling, Timothy 1:9. The Author of it is holy, and it is a call to
        holiness. ‘As He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
        manner of conversation,’ 1 Peter 1:15. ‘Ye are a chosen generation, a
        royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show
        forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His
        marvelous light,’ 1 Peter 2:9. It is a calling into the grace of Christ,
        Galatians 1:6. In this effectual calling the final perseverance of the
        saints is also secured, since it stands connected on the one hand with
        election and predestination, and on the other hand with sanctification
        and glorification. ‘The gifts and calling of God are without
        repentance.’ Calling, as the effect of predestination, must be
        irresistible, or rather invincible, and also irreversible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church of Rome perverts the meaning of this calling; for, instead of
        considering it as accompanied with the communication of life to the
        soul, they view it merely as an act which excites and calls into action
        some concealed qualities in man, and awakens some feelings of holiness
        that are in him, and some virtues which he possesses, to receive the
        grace that is proclaimed to him. In this way it must not be said, with
        the Scripture, that God communicates life to those who are dead in
        trespasses and sins, and regenerates them, but that He only aids their
        weakness, and calls forth their own exertions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it be inquired whether God calls all men with a calling sufficient
        for their salvation, that is to say, if He gives to all grace sufficient
        to save them, it is replied, that this calling may be considered as
        sufficient or insufficient in different points of view; for the
        sufficiency of grace may be considered either on the part of God or of
        man. On the part of God, it must be said that His general calling is
        sufficient, for God having created man upright, with a disposition to
        obey Him, if we consider this general calling connected with that
        original perfection, there can be no doubt that it is sufficient. But,
        on the part of man, viewed in his natural state of corruption, assuredly
        the outward call is not sufficient, unless accompanied with the internal
        operation of the Holy Spirit, to enlighten the eyes of the
        understanding, and to open the heart to receive the calling of God, any
        more than if Jesus Christ had spoken to a deaf or dead man, without
        removing his deafness, or imparting to him life. If the voice of Jesus
        calling Lazarus had been unaccompanied with His power, it would not have
        been sufficient to raise him from the grave. The calling, then, which is
        not accompanied with the power of the Spirit of God, is not sufficient
        in regard to man, while man is inexcusable, and has no just ground of
        complaint, for he resists that call which, unless he was a sinful
        creature and an enemy to God, would be sufficient. He is, as the
        Psalmist says, ‘like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; which will
        not hearken to the voice of the charmers, charm they never so wisely.’
      </p>
      <p>
        If, again, it be inquired whether men can resist the calling of God, it
        is evident that, when the calling is only external, and unaccompanied
        with the internal operation of the Spirit, they can, and always will,
        resist it, Genesis 6:3; Acts 7:51. But when the calling is, at the same
        time, internal, — when God regenerates men, and makes them new
        creatures, — the question, if they can resist this, is altogether
        nugatory; for it is as if it were inquired if a man could resist his
        creation, or a dead man his being brought to life. God here acts by His
        almighty power, without, however, forcing our will; for communicating to
        us spiritual qualities, He gives us to will and to do of His good
        pleasure. It is therefore absurd to say that a man can resist this
        influence by the hardness of his heart, since it removes that hardness,
        and is the converting of hearts of stone into hearts of flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        In opposition to this, the saying of our Lord is stated as an objection:
        ‘Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
        works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they
        would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.’ On this it is to
        be remarked, that the reference here is to Christ’s miracles, not to His
        preaching; and what is said of Tyre and Sidon is by comparison, what is
        meant being, as it seems, that the hardness of heart of those of
        Chorazin and Bethsaida surpassed that of Tyre and Sidon, and that if
        such miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would not have
        had so little effect as upon the former, although it is not said that
        the latter would have repented unto life, or that they could have been
        conferred to God except by the operation of His Spirit. Here the
        declaration of our Lord in the same context is decisive: ‘At that time
        Jesus answered and said, I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
        earth, because Thou hast hid these things (the truths of God which He
        proclaimed) from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
        babes.’ And this He resolves, not into the difference found in man, but
        into the sovereignty of God. ‘Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in
        Thy sight.’ And He immediately adds, ‘Neither knoweth any man the Father
        save the Son, and He to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.’ This must
        refer to an internal revelation; for as to that which was solely
        external, Jesus was declaring it to all. Jesus Christ knew from the
        beginning who they were that would believe and who would not believe,
        because He knew who they were whom the Father had given Him and would
        draw unto Him. And it is this eternal decree which He here shows is the
        rule of God’s calling, according to which the Son is or is not revealed:
        ‘Ye believe not, because ye are not of My sheep, as I said unto you.’
        And whom He called, them He also justified. — They whom the Holy Spirit
        effectually calls by the Gospel to the knowledge of God are also
        justified. They are ‘ungodly,’ Romans 4:5, till the moment when they are
        called; but, being then united to Christ, they are in that moment
        justified. They are instantly absolved from guilt, and made righteous,
        as having perfectly answered all the demands of the law, for by Him it
        has been fulfilled in them, verse 4. To justify signifies to pronounce
        and account righteous such as have transgressed, and forfeited the favor
        of God, as well as incurred a penalty, conveying to them deliverance
        from the penalty, and restoration to that favor. And they who are thus
        accounted righteous by God, must be righteous, for God looks upon things
        as they really are; as, being one with Christ, they are perfectly
        righteous. ‘Justification,’ says Luther, ‘takes place when, in the just
        judgment of God, our sins, and the eternal punishment due to them, are
        remitted, and when clothed with the righteousness of Christ, which is
        freely imputed to us, and reconciled to God, we are made His beloved
        children, and heirs of eternal life.’ The connection between calling and
        justification is manifest, for we must be united to Christ to enjoy the
        good derived from Him. We must be members of Christ that His obedience
        may be ours that in Him we may have righteousness. Now, he is by our
        calling that we are brought into His communion, and by communion with
        Him to the participation of His grace and blessing, which cannot fail to
        belong to them who are with Him one body, one flesh, and one spirit.
        Those who are called must therefore be justified. They who are the
        members of Jesus Christ must be partakers in His righteousness, and of
        the Spirit of life that is in Him. Whom He calls He justifies. This
        proves that there are none justified till they are called. We are
        justified by faith, which we receive when we are effectually called.
        Whom He justified, them He also glorified. — A man is justified the
        moment He believes in Christ; and here being glorified is connected with
        justification. No believer, then, finally comes short of salvation. If
        he is justified, he must in due time be glorified. To be glorified is to
        be completely conformed to the glorious image of Jesus Christ; when we
        shall see Him as He is, and be made like unto Him, enjoying that
        felicity which the Psalmist anticipated: ‘Thou wilt show me the path of
        life; in Thy presence is fullness of joy; at Thy right hand there are
        pleasures for evermore.’ The glorifying of the saints will have its
        consummation in the day of the blessed resurrection, when their bodies
        shall be made like unto the glorious body of Jesus Christ; when that
        natural body, which was sown in corruption, in dishonor, in weakness,
        shall be raised a spiritual body in corruption, in glory, in power. Then
        death will be swallowed up in victory, all tears shall be wiped away,
        the Lamb will lead and feed them, and God shall be all in all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse glorification is spoken of as having already taken place,
        because what God has determined to do may be said to be already done.
        ‘He calls those things that be not as though they were.’ The Apostle
        does not say that those whom God predestinates He calls, and that those
        whom He justifies He glorifies; but, speaking in the past time, he says
        that those whom God did predestinate, them He hath also called, and
        justified, and glorified. By this he expresses the certainty of the
        counsel of God. In the same way, in the Old Testament, things future
        were spoken of as already accomplished, on account of the infallibility
        of the promises of God; so that, before Jesus Christ came into the
        world, it was said, ‘Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.’
        And He Himself speaks of what is future as already accomplished. ‘I have
        finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do.’ ‘Now I am no more in the
        world,’ John 17:4,11. In like manner the Apostle speaks here of glory as
        already come, to show how certain it is that those who are called and
        justified shall be glorified. And this is in accordance with the object
        he has in view, which is to console the believer amidst his afflictions.
        For when he thus suffers, and all things appear to conspire for his
        ruin, and to be opposed to his eternal salvation, he is represented as
        already glorified by God, and during the combat as having already
        received the crown of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plan of salvation is here set before us in its commencement, in the
        intermediate steps of its progress, and in its consummation. Its
        commencement is laid in the eternal purpose of God, and its consummation
        in the eternal glory of the elect. He calls those whom He hath
        predestinated to faith in Christ, to repentance and to a new life. He
        justifies by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ those whom He
        hath called; and, finally, He will glorify those whom He hath justified.
        The opponents of the doctrine contained in this passage distort the
        whole plan of salvation. They deny that there is any indissoluble
        connection between those successive steps of grace, which are here
        united by the Apostle, and that these different expressions relate to
        the same individuals. They suppose that God may have foreknown and
        predestinated to life some whom He does not call, that He effectually
        calls some whom He does not justify, and that He justifies others whom
        He does not glorify. This contradicts the express language of this
        passage, which declares that those whom He foreknew He predestinated,
        that those whom he predestinated them He also called, that those whom He
        called them He also justified, and that those whom He justified them He
        also glorified. It is impossible to find words which could more forcibly
        and precisely express the indissoluble connection that subsists between
        all the parts of this series, or show that they are the same individuals
        that are spoken of throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same doctrine is in other places explicitly taught: ‘Of Him ’ (by
        God, according to His sovereign election) ‘are ye in Christ Jesus, who
        of God’ (by the appointment of God) ‘is made unto us wisdom’ (in our
        calling), ‘righteousness’ (by the imputation of His righteousness),
        ‘sanctification’ (in making us conformed to His image), and ‘redemption’
        (in giving us eternal glory). ‘These truths are also declared in 2
        Thessalonians 2:13. ‘God hath from the beginning chosen you to
        salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth
        whereunto He called you by our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of
        our Lord Jesus Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is, indeed, often objected to the doctrine of grace, that, according
        to it, men may live as they list; if they are certainly to be saved,
        they may indulge in sin with impunity. But, according to Paul’s
        statements in this chapter, all the doctrines respecting the salvation
        of the elect are indissolubly connected, and a single link in the chain
        is never wanting. He who has ordained the end, has ordained the means.
        He who has chosen them in Christ, from before the ‘foundation of the
        world, has chosen them through sanctification of the Spirit and belief
        of the truth, Thessalonians 2:13. If they are predestinated to be
        conformed to the image of the Son, they are in due time called by the
        word and Spirit of God. If they are called, they are justified, so that
        there is no unrighteousness to stand in the way of their acceptance. If
        they are justified, they will also be glorified in the appointed season.
        How fatally erroneous, then, is the opinion of those who say that, if we
        are predestinated, we shall obtain eternal glory in whatever way we
        live! Such a conclusion breaks this heavenly chain. It is vain for human
        ingenuity to attempt to find an imperfection in the plans of Divine
        wisdom in ordering the steps in the salvation of His people: ‘the word
        of God effectually worketh in them that believe,’ 1 Thessalonians 2:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the passage before us, we see that all the links of that chain by
        which man is drawn up to heaven, are inseparable. In the whole of it
        there is nothing but grace, whether we contemplate its beginning, its
        middle, or its end. Each of its parts furnishes the most important
        instruction. If we are elected, let us feel and experience in ourselves
        the effects of our election. If we are called, let us walk worthy of our
        vocation. If we are justified, let us, like Abraham show our faith and
        prove our justification by our works. If we shall be glorified, let us
        live as fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God. Let
        our conversation be in heaven, and let us confess that we are pilgrims
        and strangers on the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In looking back on this passage, we should observe that, in all that is
        stated, man acts no part, but is passive, and all is done by God. He is
        elected, and predestinated, and called, and justified, and glorified by
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle was here concluding all that he had said before in
        enumerating topics of consolation to believers, and is now going on to
        show that God is ‘for us,’ or on the part of His people. Could anything,
        then, be more consolatory to those who love God, than to be in this
        manner assured that the great concern of their salvation is not left in
        their own keeping God, even their covenant God, hath taken the whole
        upon Himself. He hath undertaken for them. There is no room, then, for
        chance or change: He will perfect that which concerneth them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same great truths are held forth in every part of the new covenant
        which God makes with His people, Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:8-12. It
        consists exclusively of absolute promises on the part of God, and from
        beginning to end is grace and only grace. But does the doctrine of grace
        encourage licentiousness? To assert this directly contradicts the
        Scriptures, which show that grace has the very opposite tendency. ‘The
        grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching
        us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
        righteously, and godly in this present world,’ Titus 2:11,12. Such is
        the testimony of God. ‘The grace of God manifests His love, and produces
        love in us, which is the first-fruit of the spirit, and the foundation
        of all acceptable obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let every believer glory in this grace of God by which he is
        predestinated, and called, and justified, and glorified. This is all his
        consolation and all his joy, for it is an indissoluble chain, which
        neither the world nor the powers of hell can break. Does he feel a holy
        sadness for having offended God, a holy desire to struggle against the
        corruptions of his heart, and to advance in the work of sanctification?
        does he hunger and thirst after righteousness, and is he seeking to put
        on the new man, and to possess more of the image of Christ? Let him
        conclude, from these certain marks of his calling, that he is justified,
        the righteousness of Christ being imputed to him, and that his happiness
        is as certain as if he was already glorified. But, on the other hand,
        let none abuse these doctrines. No one shall be glorified who does not
        previously partake of this holy calling. Let no one attempt to take away
        any of the parts of this chain, and to pass from election without the
        intermediate steps to glory. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 31: — What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us,
        who can be against us?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the Apostle makes a sudden and solemn pause, while he emphatically
        demands, What shall we then say to these things? What can be said
        against them? Is it possible to value them too highly? What use shall we
        make of such consoling truths? What comfort shall we draw from them? Can
        anything detract from the peace they afford? On the foundation that God
        is for him, the eternal interest of the Christian is secured, and though
        he wrestles not only against flesh and blood, but against principalities
        and powers, and against the rulers of the darkness of this world; though
        of himself he can do nothing, yet, through Christ strengthening him, he
        can do all things. But what shall they say to these things who reject
        the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints; who maintain that God
        allows some to perish whom He hath justified; and that many things,
        instead of working for their good, contribute to their ruin? A
        conclusion entirely the reverse is to be deduced from all the
        consolations previously set forth by the Apostle, in reference to which
        he now exclaims, If God be for us who can be against us?
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression if, which Paul here uses, does not denote doubt, but is a
        conclusion, or consequence, or affirmation, signifying since; as if he
        had said, Since we see by all these things that God is for us, who shall
        be against us? For is it not evident that God is for us, since He hath
        sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba,
        Father;’ since the Spirit helps our infirmities; since all things work
        together for our good; since we are predestinated to be conformed to the
        image of His Son? When we were alienated from Him, He called us; when we
        were sinners, He justified us; and, finally, translating us from a scene
        of trouble and afflictions, He will confer on us a crown of immortal
        glory. Since, then God thus favors us, who can be against us?
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, however, in every age, speak of these things very blasphemously.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are far from being pleasing to man’s wisdom. But they excite a
        different feeling in the breast of every Christian. They give a security
        to God’s people which supports them under a sense of their own weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they had no strength but their own, if there were no security for
        their perseverance but their own resolutions, they might indeed despond;
        for how could they ever arrive at heaven? But as this passage shows,
        that all things are secured by God, and that in His almighty hands all
        the links of the chain that connects them with heaven are indissolubly
        united, they have no language in which they can adequately express their
        wonder, gratitude, and joy. No truth can be more evident than this —
        that although we have innumerable enemies, and are ourselves utter
        weakness, yet, if God be for us, nothing can be so against us as finally
        to do us injury. As the angel said to Gideon, ‘The Lord is with thee,’
        so the same is said in this passage to every Christian. ‘No weapon that
        is formed against thee shall prosper.’ ‘All men forsook me,’ said Paul,
        ‘but the Lord stood by me.’ As God had said to Israel, and Moses, and
        Joshua, so He said, ‘Fear not, Paul, for I am with thee.’ When
        Christians, surrounded with difficulties and enemies, are disposed to
        say, with the servant of Elisha, ‘Alas, what shall we do?’ the passage
        before us speaks the same language as did the Prophet, ‘Fear not, for
        they that be with us, are more than they that be with them,’ and
        likewise that of Hezekiah, ‘There be more with us than with them. With
        them is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and
        to fight our battles.’ It is added, ‘And the people rested themselves
        upon the words of Hezekiah, King of Judah.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us we have two propositions. One is, that God is for
        us; the other, that nothing can be — that is, can prevail — against us.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we may consider who are against, and who is for believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is arrayed against them a formidable host composed of many
        powerful enemies. There are Satan and all wicked spirits; there are the
        world, and indwelling sin; there are all sufferings, and death itself.
        How could believers themselves withstand the power of such antagonists?
        But, on the other hand, the Apostle shows in one word who is for them.
        God, says he, is for us! God is the shield of His people: He holds them
        in His hand, and none can pluck them out of it. ‘The eternal God is thy
        refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 32. — He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
        all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse, the Apostle had comforted believers from the
        consideration that, if God, with all His glorious attributes, were
        engaged for their defense, they might look without dismay upon an
        opposing universe. Here, in order to confirm their confidence in God, he
        presents an argument to prove that God is with them of a truths and also
        to assure them that they shall receive from Him every blessing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two circumstances calculated to inspire distrust in the mind
        of the believer. The one is the affections which press upon him in this
        world; and these of two kinds, namely, such as are common to all men,
        and such as are peculiar to the followers of Christ. The other
        circumstance calculated to cloud the hopes of the Christian, is the sins
        of which he is guilty. When suffering so many troubles, he has
        difficulty in persuading himself that he is favored by God, and is
        ready, with Gideon, to exclaim to the angel, ‘Oh my Lord, if the LORD be
        with us, why then is all this befallen us?’ And, on the other hand, as
        he is by nature a child of wrath, and sins daily, how can he be sure
        that God is with him, and not rather against him? To these objections
        the Apostle here opposes the declaration that God hath not spared His
        own Son, but delivered Him up to the death for His people. No stronger
        argument could be offered in proof of His favor to them than the gift of
        His own Son. Him He has given to redeem them from all their sins and all
        their troubles; while such is the dignity and excellency of Christ, that
        the Apostle, arguing from the greater to the less, further proves that
        after such a gift as that of His own Son, nothing can be refused which
        is consistent with the glory of God and the salvation of their souls. He
        thus assures them of freedom from the evils they might dread from sin
        and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul does not say that the Father has given His Son, but that God has
        given Him. This is calculated to establish the confidence of believers
        more firmly, since, by referring to God, He brings into view all His
        perfections as infinitely good, powerful, wise, and able to render them
        supremely blessed in holiness and eternal glory. Another effect is to
        draw their attention to the greatness of the love of God; for one to
        whom we are in some respects equal may confer upon us His favors, but
        here we are reminded that the bestower is infinitely above us, being the
        Creator to whom we are indebted even for our existence. His goodness,
        then, is so much the more wonderful, that though He is the infinite
        Jehovah, dwelling in light which is inaccessible, of whom it is said
        ‘that He humbleth Himself to behold the things that are in heaven’
        <19B306> Psalm 113:6, still He draws near to us, and condescends to
        raise us up, who are as nothing before Him, and who, being the Creator
        of all things, has set His love on those who are sinful, and poor, and
        miserable.
      </p>
      <p>
        What God has given is His own Son. — This imports that He is His Son in
        the sense of that relation among men. It is sonship in this sense only
        that shows the immensity of the love of God in this gift. This proves
        that it was greater than if He had given the whole creation. If His Son
        were related to Him in merely a figurative sonship, it could not be a
        proof of His ineffable love. God did not spare Him. — Not sparing Him
        may either mean that He spared Him not in a way of justice, 2 Peter 2:4,
        that is, exacted the utmost farthing of debt He had taken upon Him; or
        that He spared Him not in a way of bounty, that is, withheld Him not God
        spared Abraham’s son, but He spared not His own Son. This passage shows
        that Christ was given over by the Father to the sufferings which He
        bore, and that these sufferings were all necessary for the salvation of
        His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had they not been necessary, He would not have exposed His Son to them.
        ‘It became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in
        bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation
        perfect through sufferings.’ From all this it appears that God, who
        cannot deny Himself, 2 Timothy 2:13, could not show mercy to us without
        satisfying the demands of His justice, vindicating the authority of His
        law, and magnifying and honoring all the perfections of His nature.
        Delivered Him up for us all. — When the Jews seized and crucified our
        Lord Jesus Christ, He was delivered up by the Father’s decree, and by
        the direction of His providence, though it was through the guilty
        criminality of the Jews that He was put to death. It took place when His
        appointed hour arrived, for till then they could not accomplish their
        purpose. ‘Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified
        and slain.’ As the Father delivered Him up, the great end of His
        suffering was satisfaction of the justice of God; and as He bore the
        whole curse of the broken law, His people are never, on that account, to
        bear any portion of vindictive wrath. ‘It was exacted, and He answered,’
        Isaiah 53:7. ‘Then;’ says the Son Himself, ‘I restored that which I took
        not away,’ Psalm 69:4. Thus the Father delivered up His Son to
        humiliation, involving an assumption of our nature and our
        transgressions. He delivered Him up to sorrows unparalleled, and even to
        death itself, — to death, not merely involving the dissolution of the
        soul and body, but the weight of the sins of men, and the wrath of God
        against sin. God thus delivered up His Son, that He might rescue us from
        that misery which He might have justly inflicted upon us, and might take
        us, who were children of wrath, into His heavenly presence, and there
        rejoice over us for ever, as the trophies of His redeeming love. For us
        all. — That is, for all to whom the Apostle is writing, whom he had
        addressed as beloved of God, called, saints, Romans 1:7, among whom he
        ranks himself. But as these epistles to the churches equally apply to
        all believers to the end of time, so this expression includes all the
        elect of God — all who have been given to Jesus — all in whose behalf He
        addressed the Father in His intercessory prayer. ‘I pray for them. I
        pray not for the world, but for them which Thou hast given Me,’ John
        17:9,20. That those to whom Paul here refers when he says, ‘for us all,’
        applies to none but believers, is evident, — 1st, because in the
        preceding and following verses the Apostle speaks of those who love God,
        and who are the called according to His purpose; 2nd, he says in express
        terms that He will with Him freely give us all things, which implies
        that we have faith, by which we receive Jesus Christ. This absolute
        gift, then, concerns only those who, being elected by God, believe in
        Him. How shall He not with Him freely give us all things? — This is the
        most conclusive reasoning. If He has given us the greatest gift, He will
        not refuse the lesser. His Son is the greatest gift that could be given,
        — plainly, then, nothing will be withheld from those for whom He has
        given His Son. This also assumes the fact as granted, that Jesus is the
        Son of God in the literal sense; for in no other sense is the inference
        just. If Jesus were only figuratively a son, there is no room to infer,
        from the gift of Him to us, that the Father will give ‘us all things.’
        These ‘all things’ are what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard. He will
        give His Spirit and eternal life. His children are heirs of God and
        joint heirs with Jesus Christ, whom He hath appointed heir of all
        things. The Apostle does not here speak of himself alone, as if this
        were a privilege peculiar to himself, to receive freely all things with
        Christ, but of all believers, — He will freely give us . And the
        expression, How, with which he commences, imports the absolute certainty
        that on all such they shall be bestowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it is here said that God will give us all things, we are reminded
        that all the good things that we obtain or hope for are from God, who is
        the Author of every good and perfect gift: for a man can receive nothing
        except it be given him from heaven; and all that God gives us He gives
        freely, without money and without price. Here it may be remarked that
        the Apostle’s manner of reasoning, who concludes that, since God has not
        spared His own Son but delivered Him up for us all, He will with Him
        also freely give us all things, teaches us that the believer ought to
        reason out of the Scriptures, and draw the necessary consequence from
        what is said in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 33. — Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is
        God that justifieth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the temptations to which the believer is exposed in this life,
        some are from without, others are from within. Within are the alarms of
        conscience, fearing the wrath of God; without are adversity and
        tribulations. Unless he overcomes the first he cannot prevail against
        the last. It is impossible that he can possess true patience and
        confidence in God in his afflictions, if his conscience labors under the
        apprehension of the wrath of God. On this account the Apostle, in the
        fifth chapter of this Epistle, in setting forth the accompaniments of
        justification by faith, first speaks of peace with God, and afterwards
        of glorying in tribulations. In the chapter before us he observes the
        same order; for, in this last part of it, in which he speaks of the
        triumph of the believer, he first fortifies the conscience against its
        fears from guilt, and next secures it against external temptations from
        afflictions. As to the first, he says, ‘Who shall lay anything to the
        charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth; it is Christ that
        died, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession
        for us.’ And as to the last, ‘Who shall separate us from the love of
        Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
        sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors.’
      </p>
      <p>
        He does not mean to say that nothing shall occur to trouble believers,
        but that nothing shall prevail against them. In assuring them of this,
        he ascends to their election as the source of all their blessings. Who
        shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? — The Apostle speaks
        here of God’s elect. This reminds believers that their election is not
        to be ascribed to anything in themselves, but is to be traced solely to
        the grace and mercy of God, by whom they were chosen in Christ before
        the, foundation of the world, Ephesians 1:4. Their election demonstrates
        the vanity of all accusations that can be brought against them, either
        by their own conscience, by the world, or by Satan. Thus, while the
        Apostle removes every ground of boasting and vainglory, and all
        presumptuous thoughts of themselves, of their freewill and
        self-righteousness, he lays the sure foundation of joy and peace in
        believing. He leads us to the election of God as the source of all the
        good we enjoy or hope for, in order to set aside every ground for
        vainglory, and all presumption as to any worthiness in ourselves of our
        own will or righteousness, so that we may fully recognize the grace and
        mercy of God to us, who, even when we did not exist, chose us for
        Himself, according to His own good pleasure, Ephesians 1:4,5. He
        likewise does so that we may have a sure foundation to rest on, even
        God’s eternal and unchangeable purpose, instead of any fallacious hope
        from reliance on anything in ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it is said here, ‘Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s
        elect?’ it does not refer to men generally, but to believers as the
        elect of God. The word elect must be taken in this place in its
        connection with called, as in the preceding verses, since it is here
        found connected with justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a man might be elected, and yet not be for the present justified, as
        Paul, when he persecuted the Church, who was not justified till he
        actually believed, though even then elected, and, according to God’s
        purpose and counsel, ordained to salvation. It is God that justifeth. —
        This is the first thing which the Apostle opposes to the accusations
        that might be brought against the elect of God:
      </p>
      <p>
        God justifies them. There is none that justifies besides God. None can
        absolve and acquit a sinner from guilt, and constitute and pronounce him
        righteous, but God alone! ‘I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy
        transgressions for Mine own sake,’ Isaiah 43:25; for it is God alone
        against whom sin is committed, in reference to future condemnation.
        ‘Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned,’ Psalm 51:4. It is God alone
        that condemns, and therefore it is God alone that justifies. If, then,
        God has made believers just or righteous, who is he that will bring them
        in guilty? There are here two grounds upon which the Apostle founds the
        justification of believers. One is taken from its Author — it is God
        that justifies; the other is taken from the subjects of this privilege —
        they are the elect. And thus the freeness of justification, and its
        permanency, are both certified.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here established that the elect are saved in such a way that
        nothing can be laid to their charge. All their debt, then, must be paid,
        and all their sins must be atoned for. If full compensation has not been
        made, something might be laid to their charge. This shows that salvation
        is by justice, as well as by mercy, and gives a view of salvation that
        never would have entered into the heart of man. Nay, it is so far from
        human view, that even after it is revealed, it still lies hid from all
        the world, except from those who are taught of God. And some, even of
        them, being slow of heart to believe, are but partially enlightened in
        this glorious view of the salvation of the guilty.

      <p>
        Ver. 34. — Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea
        rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
        also maketh intercession for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who is he that condemneth? — In the preceding verse it is asked, Who
        shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? here it is demanded,
        Who shall condemn them? They who cannot be accused cannot be condemned.
      </p>
      <p>
        God Himself is pleased to justify the elect, to deliver them from
        condemnation, and views them as possessing perfect righteousness; and
        being in this justified state by the judicial sentence of God, who shall
        dare to condemn them? None can discover a single sin of which to accuse
        them as still subjecting them to the curse of the law, and to bring them
        into that condemnation, from which they have been delivered by what God
        Himself hath done for them. It is here supposed that their condemnation
        is impossible, because it would be unjust. In similar language, the Lord
        Jesus Christ, the first elect of God, speaking by the Prophet Isaiah,
        50:8, says, ‘He is near that justifieth Me; who will contend with Me?’
        These words relate to His confidence in His Heavenly Father, who would
        uphold Him as His righteous servant; and it is on His righteousness and
        work that the acquittal of all those whom the Father hath given Him, and
        who are elected in Him, is rested. The Apostle having said that it is
        God that justifieth them, next proceeds to give the reasons of their
        freedom from condemnation. Four grounds are here stated: — 1st ,
        Christ’s death; 2nd , His resurrection; 3rd , His enthronement at the
        right hand of God; and, 4th , His intercession. It is Christ that died.
        — By His death, the penalty of the holy law, on account of its violation
        by His people, was executed, and satisfaction made to Divine justice. In
        answer to the question, Who is he that condemneth? the Apostle replies
        that Christ died. By this he intimates the impossibility of our being
        absolved from sin, without satisfaction for the injury done to the
        rights of God’s justice and the sacred majesty of His eternal laws which
        had been violated; for the just God could not set aside His justice by
        His mercy, and justify sinners without an atonement. It is on this
        account that God had instituted sacrifices under the law, to hold forth
        the necessity of a satisfaction, and to prove that without shedding of
        blood there could be no remission of sin. There is, then, a manifest
        necessity of repairing the outrage against the perfections of God, which
        are the original and fundamental rule of the duty of the creature. This
        reparation could only be made by a satisfaction that should correspond
        with the august majesty of the holiness of God; and consequently it must
        be of infinite value, which could only be found in a person of infinite
        dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the death of Jesus Christ as the atonement for sin, our eyes are
        constantly directed throughout the Scriptures, whether by types, by
        prophecies, or by historical descriptions of the event. Death was the
        punishment threatened in the covenant of works against sin. But Jesus
        Christ had neither transgressed that covenant, nor could participate in
        the imputation of the sin of Adam, because He sprang not from him by the
        way of natural generation. Being, therefore, without sin, either actual
        or imputed, the penalty of death could not be incurred on His own
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Death, then, which is the wages of sin, must have been suffered by Him
        for sinners. Their iniquities were laid on Him, and by His stripes they
        are healed. His death, therefore, utterly forbids the condemnation of
        the elect of God, who were given to Him, and are one with Him, of whom
        only the context speaks. It must be a just and full compensation for
        their sins. It is evidently implied that none for whom He died can be
        condemned. For if condemnation be forbidden by His death, then that
        condemnation must be prohibited with respect to all for whom He died.
        His death made satisfaction to justice for them, and therefore, in their
        case, both accusation and condemnation are rendered impossible. Yea
        rather, that is risen again. — This is the second ground affirmed by the
        Apostle against the possibility of the condemnation of God’s elect.
      </p>
      <p>
        What purpose would the death of Christ have served, if He had been
        overcome and swallowed up by it? ‘If Christ be not raised, your faith is
        vain; ye are yet in your sins.’ If He be not risen, it must be because
        He had not expiated those sins for which He died, and was therefore
        retained a prisoner by death. But since the Surety has been released
        from the grave, complete satisfaction must have been made; for if but
        one sin which had been laid upon Him had continued unatoned for, He
        would have remained for ever in the grave, death being the wages of sin.
        But now, since He has risen from the grave, the obligation against His
        people must be effaced and entirely abolished, His resurrection being
        their resurrection, Colossians 2:12. It is on this account that the
        Apostle here opposes to condemnation not only the death of Christ, but
        also His resurrection, as something higher, and as being our full
        absolution. And, by the commandment of Jesus Christ, the Gospel was not
        announced to the Gentiles, nor spread through the world, till after His
        resurrection, as He Himself said, Luke 24:46: ‘It behooved Christ to
        suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, that repentance and
        remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The resurrection, then, of Christ, is the proof of His victory, and of
        the entire expiation of His people’s sins. It is therefore opposed to
        their condemnation, as being the evidence and completion of their
        absolution and acquittal; for as the death of Jesus Christ was His
        condemnation, and that of all united to Him, so His resurrection is His
        absolution and also theirs. As the Father, by delivering Him to death,
        condemned their sins in Him, so, in raising Him from the dead, he
        pronounced their acquittal from all the sins that had been laid upon
        Him. This is what the Apostle teaches respecting the justification of
        Jesus Christ. He was justified by the Spirit, 1 Timothy 3:16; that is,
        declared and recognized to be righteous; and with regard to His people’s
        justification in Him, that as He had died for their sins, so He was
        raised for their justification. The resurrection of Jesus Christ was a
        manifestation of His Godhead and Divine power. He was declared to be the
        Son of God, and consequently possessing over all things absolute power
        and dominion. ‘For to this end Christ both died and rose, and revived,
        that He might be Lord both of the dead and living.’ Who is even at the
        right hand of God. — This is the third ground on which the security of
        God’s elect is rested. Jesus Christ sits at God’s right hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a figurative expression taken from the custom of earthly
        monarchs, to express special favor, and denotes, with respect to Christ,
        both dignity and power. ‘When He had by Himself purged our sins, He sat
        down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.’ Having finished the work
        of redemption, this was the result of His labors, and the testimony of
        its consummation. His thus sitting down indicates an essential
        difference between our Lord Jesus Christ and the Levitical priests.
        ‘Every priest standeth daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the
        same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this Man, after He
        had offered one sacrifice for sin, for ever sat down on the right hand
        of God.’ The Levitical priests had never finished their work: it was
        still imperfect. They stood, therefore, ministering daily, in token of
        continued service. But Christ having offered one sacrifice for sins, by
        which He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified, for ever sat
        down on the right hand of God, Hebrews 10:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, then, is not only raised from the dead, but has also
        ascended into heaven, and is possessed of all power and glory, and is
        there to defend His people. His seat at the right hand of God signifies
        His permanent exaltation as Mediator, and His communion with God in
        sovereign power and authority, reigning as the Head and King of His
        Church. The amount of the Apostles reasoning is, that such being the
        condition of Him who was dead and is risen again, possessed of the keys
        of hell and of death, who shall dare to appear before Him to bring an
        accusation against His members or to condemn the elect of God? Who also
        maketh intercession for us. — This is the fourth and last ground of the
        security of God’s elect. The intercession of Jesus Christ is the second
        act of His priesthood, and is a necessary consequence of His sacrifice,
        which is the first act, and precedes the third, namely, His coming forth
        from the heavenly sanctuary to bless those whom He has redeemed to God
        by His blood. His intercession consists in that perpetual application
        which He makes to His Father; in the name of His Church, of the blood
        which He shed on the cross for the salvation of His people, in order to
        obtain for them the fruits of that oblation. It was necessary that His
        sacrifice should be offered upon earth, because it was an act of His
        humiliation; but His intercession which supposes the establishment of
        righteousness and peace, is made in heaven, being an act of His
        exaltation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This intercession was figuratively represented by the high priest in
        Israel, when, after having offered in his linen garments the sacrifice,
        without the precincts of the holy place, he took the blood of the
        victim, and, clothed in his sacerdotal golden robes, entered alone into
        the most holy place, and sprinkled the blood on and before the
        mercy-seat. Jesus Christ, then, who suffered without the gate, Hebrews
        13:12, in accomplishing the truth of this figure, first offered upon
        earth His sacrifice, and afterwards entered in His glory into heaven, to
        present to His Father the infinite price of His oblation by the mystical
        sprinkling of His blood. This is not to be understood as being any
        bodily humiliation, as bowing the knee before God, but it is the
        presenting of His blood of perpetual efficacy. It is the voice of that
        blood which speaketh better things than the blood of Abel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blood of Jesus Christ being the blood of the everlasting covenant —
        that blood which was to reunite God with men, and men with God — it was
        necessary, after its being shed on the cross, that it should be thus
        sprinkled in heaven. ‘I go,’ says He to His disciples, ‘to prepare a
        place for you.’ It was necessary that this blood should be sprinkled
        there, and also upon them, before they could be admitted. But by its
        means they were prepared to enter into heaven, and heaven itself was
        prepared for their reception, which without that sprinkling would have
        been defiled by their presence. ‘Neither by the blood of goats and
        calves, but by His own blood, He entered in once into the holy place,
        having obtained eternal redemption.’ Jesus Christ is not only seated at
        the right hand of God, but He is there for the very purpose of
        interceding for His people. By the perpetual efficacy of His blood their
        sins are removed, and consequently every ground of their condemnation.
        This never-ceasing intercession of Him who ever liveth to advocate their
        cause, not only procures the remission of their sins, but also all the
        graces of the Holy Spirit; and by the efficacy of the Holy Spirit an
        internal aspersion is made upon their hearts when they are actually
        converted to God, and when by faith they receive the sprinkling of the
        blood of their Redeemer. For them He died, He rose, He ascended to
        heaven, and there intercedes. How, then, can they be condemned? How can
        they come short of eternal glory?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 35. — Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
        tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
        peril, or sword?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the contemplation of those glorious truths and Divine consolations
        which the Apostle had been unfolding, he had demanded, Who shall accuse,
        who shall condemn, the elect of God? he here triumphantly asks, Who
        shall separate them from the love of Christ? Having pointed out the
        grounds on which the fears of behaviors from within are relieved, he now
        fortifies them against fears from without. This order is the more
        proper, since their internal fears and misgivings are more formidable
        than their outward trials, and the hatred and opposition of the world;
        and until the believer, as has been observed, has overcome the former by
        having the answer of a good conscience towards God, he is not prepared
        to withstand the latter. Although the people of God are exposed to all
        the evils here enumerated, these shall not prevail to separate him from
        the love of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term the love of Christ, in itself, may signify either our love to
        Christ, or Christ’s love to us; but that it is Christ’s love to us in
        this place there can be no question. A person could not be said to be
        separated from his own feelings. Besides, the object of the Apostle is
        to assure us not so immediately of our love to God, as of His love to
        us, by directing our attention to His predestining, calling, justifying,
        and glorifying us, and not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up
        for us. In addition to this, it contributes more to our consolation to
        have our minds fixed upon God’s love to us than upon our love to God;
        for, as our love is subject to many failings and infirmities, and as we
        are liable to change, to endeavor to impart consolation from the
        firmness of our love, would be less efficacious than holding forth to us
        the love of God, in whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of
        change. The language, too, employed, favors this sense; for the Apostle
        does not say, ‘Who shall separate Christ from our love?’ but, ‘Who shall
        separate us from the love of Christ?’ and, in the 37th verse, the
        meaning is determined by the expression, ‘We are more than conquerors
        through Him that loved us. ’ God, however, in loving His children, makes
        them love Him; and believers are enabled to love Christ because He loves
        them. It is He who first loved us, and in loving us has changed our
        hearts, and produced in them love to Him. Paul prays that believers,
        ‘being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all
        saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to
        know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that they may be
        filled with all the fullness of God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        To have a just idea of the love of Christ, we must contemplate its
        duration. It was from before the foundation of the world — from all
        eternity. We must consider that He who has loved us is the high and
        lofty One who inhabiteth eternity, who dwelleth in light that is
        inaccessible; before whom the angels veil their faces, crying, ‘Holy,
        holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts;’ and before whom the inhabitants of the
        earth are as grasshoppers, and the nations as a drop of a bucket. We
        must remember, too, who we are, who are the objects of His love, — not
        only creatures who are but dust and ashes, dwelling in houses of clay,
        but who were His enemies, and by nature children of wrath. We must also
        reflect on the greatness of His love, that it is His will we should be
        one with Him, and that He guards us as the apple of His eye. He loves
        His people as His members, of whom He is the Head, and sympathizes with
        them when they suffer. He calls their sufferings His sufferings, and
        their persecutions His persecutions, as He said to Saul persecuting His
        members, ‘Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?’ He will also say to
        those on His right hand in the day of judgment that He hungered, and
        thirsted, and was naked, and that they gave Him to eat and drink, and
        clothed Him, when these things were done to the least of His members. He
        loves His people, too, as being their Husband, by that spiritual
        marriage He has contracted with them, as it is said, ‘Husbands, love
        your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for
        it.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The love here spoken of as the security of believers being the love of
        Christ, Christ must be God. Were Christ not God, we might come short of
        heaven without being separated from His love. He might love, and yet not
        be able to save the objects of His love.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is likewise to be remarked, that the confidence of believers that
        they shall not be separated from the love of Christ, is not founded on
        their high opinion of themselves, or on their own ability to remain firm
        against temptations, but is grounded on Christ’s love, and His ability
        to preserve and uphold them. As nothing can be laid to their charge — as
        none can condemn them — as all things that happen to them, instead of
        proving injurious, work together for their good, — it is impossible that
        they can be finally lost. If Christ so love them, what shall separate
        them from that love?
      </p>
      <p>
        In specifying those evils which in appearance are calculated to separate
        the believer from the love of Christ, the Apostle points out the
        sufferings of the people of God, the time of these sufferings — all the
        day long; the manner — as sheep for the slaughter; the cause — for Thy
        sake. He distinguishes the seven evils that follow: — 1st , Tribulation.
        — This is placed first, as being a general term, comprehending all the
        particulars which he afterwards enumerates. It means affliction in
        general. It refers not only to the general state of suffering which,
        when man had sinned, it was pronounced should be his lot — ’In sorrow
        shalt thou eat of it (of the produce of the ground) all the days of thy
        life’ — but also more particularly to the tribulation which the
        disciples of Christ shall all more or less experience. ‘In the world ye
        shall have tribulation,’ John 16:33. The tribulation of unbelievers is
        the effect of the wrath of God; but the afflictions of His people are
        salutary corrections, which, so far from separating them from His love,
        yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and are for their profit,
        that they might not be condemned with the world, but be partakers of His
        holiness. ‘As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.’
      </p>
      <p>
        To tribulation is added, 2nd , Distress, which signifies straits,
        difficulties, critical situations. It means the perplexity in which we
        are, when, under pressure or trouble, we see no way of deliverance, and
        no way to escape presents itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word denotes a narrow place, in which we are so much pressed or
        straitened that we know not where to go or turn; which expresses the
        condition of the believer when he is not only oppressed, but reduced to
        extremity. ‘Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress,’ Psalm 4:1.
        3rd , Persecution is affliction for the profession of the Gospel. The
        persecuted have often been pursued and constrained to flee from place to
        place, as the Lord Jesus was carried into Egypt when Herod sought to
        kill Him. ‘If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you.’
        But so far is persecution from separating believers from the love of
        Christ, that ‘Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’
        sake.’ 4th , Famine. — To this the persecuted are frequently subjected,
        though they may have been rich and powerful. 5th , Nakedness. — The
        disciples have often been reduced to indigence and poverty, stripped by
        their enemies, and obliged to wander naked in deserts, and to hide
        themselves, like wild beasts, in caves of the earth, Hebrews 11:38. Paul
        himself was frequently exercised with hunger, and thirst, and fastings,
        and cold, and nakedness. 6th , Peril. — This refers to the dangers to
        which the Lord’s people are exposed. These, at some times, and in some
        countries, are exceedingly many and great; and at all times, and in all
        countries, are more or less numerous and trying. If God were not their
        protector, even in this land of freedom, the followers of the Lamb would
        be cut off or injured. It is the Lord’s providence that averts such
        injuries, or overrules events for the protection of His people. This is
        too little considered even by themselves, and would be thought a most
        unfounded calumny or fanatical idea by the world. But let the Christian
        habitually consider his safety and protection as secured by the Lord,
        rather than by the liberality of the times. That time never yet was when
        the Lord’s people could be safe, if circumstances removed restraint from
        the wicked. Those who boast of their unbounded liberality would, if in
        situations calculated to develop their natural hatred of the truth,
        prove, after all, bitter persecutors. f44 7th , Sword. — This means
        violence carried to the utmost extremity. It is persecution which stops
        not with smaller injuries but inflicts even death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 36. — As it is written, For Thy sake we are killed all the day
        long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is written. — To the enumeration of evils presented in the
        foregoing verse, the Apostle here adds the testimony of the Scriptures,
        by which he verifies what is declared in the fifteenth chapter. ‘For
        whatever things were written afore time, were written for our learning
        that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.’
        And to what purpose would, it be to appeal to the afflictions of the
        Church under the former dispensation, were it not to lead us to patience
        under the Gospel?
      </p>
      <p>
        For if believers in that period bore their trials with patience, how
        much more should we do so when God now clearly reveals His saving grace,
        and not as formerly in figures and shadowed. In this manner the Lord and
        His Apostles frequently appeal to the Old Testament Scriptures, by which
        they testify to them as the word of God, and also show the agreement
        between the Old Testament and the New. The reference, then, is not
        intended to state a similar fact in similar language, by way of what is
        called accommodation, according to the interpretation of Mr. Stuart, Mr.
        Tholuck, and others. A greater indignity to the Scriptures, and the
        Spirit of God, by whom they were dictated, cannot be offered, than to
        assert that passages of the Old Testament, which are quoted by the
        Apostles as predictions, are only an accommodation of words. This would
        not merely be silly, but heinously criminal. It is not only irreverent
        to suppose that the Apostles, in order to enforce the truth of what they
        were teaching, would quote the language of the Spirit in a meaning which
        the Holy Spirit did not intend to convey, but it is a charge of palpable
        falsehood and dishonesty against the writers of the New Testament, as
        calling that a fulfillment which is not a fulfillment, and appealing to
        the Old Testament declarations as confirmatory of their own doctrine,
        when they were aware that it was merely a fanciful accommodation of
        words, and that they were deluding their readers. Are practices to be
        admitted, in explanation of the word of God, which are never tolerated
        on other subjects, and which, if detected, would cover their authors
        with disgrace?
      </p>
      <p>
        The quotation here shows that this passage in the Psalm, to which the
        reference is made, was in its fullest sense a prediction, and this
        regards the fulfillment. It was indeed a historical fact, and verified
        with respect to the Jews. But this fact, instead of proving it not to be
        prophetical and typical, is the very circumstance that fits it for that
        purpose. ‘The quotation here,’ says Professor Stuart, ‘comes from Psalm
        44:22 [Septuagint 43:22], and is applied to the state of Christians in
        the Apostle’s times, as it was originally to those whom the Psalmist
        describes; in other words, the Apostle describes the state of suffering
        Christians, by the terms which were employed in ancient days to describe
        the suffering people of God.’
      </p>
      <p>
        What could be more degrading to the book of God than the supposition
        that the Apostles ever quoted the Scriptures in this manner, by way of
        accommodation? How does this hide the glory of the perfection of the Old
        Testament, as in figure it exhibits Christ and His Church! For Thy sake.
        — It was for God’s sake that the Jews were hated and persecuted by the
        other nations, because, according to the commandment of God, they
        separated themselves from them in all their worship. They could have not
        religious fellowship with them, and on that account they were regarded
        as enemies to the rest of mankind. In like manner, when Christianity
        appeared, preferring a solemn charge of falsehood against all other
        religions in the world, Christians were accused of hating all mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the grand accusation against them in primitive times by the
        heathens, and even by such historians as the so-called philosophic
        Tacitus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians, in the same way, are still hated by the world, because they
        profess that salvation is only through the blood of Christ. As this
        implies that all who do not hold that doctrine are in error and
        ignorance, and under condemnation, it excites in the strongest manner
        the enmity of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the cause of this hatred must be traced to a principle still deeper,
        even the enmity of the carnal mind against God, and against His image in
        man, wherever it is seen. It is the working of that enmity which God put
        at the beginning between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the
        woman, Genesis 3:15 The afflictions and trials of the people of God are
        here referred to, to induce believers to exercise patience, to teach
        them not to promise themselves exemption from the treatment experienced
        by those who formerly lived under the covenant of God, but rather to
        remember that, if sometimes spared, it is owing to the forbearance and
        mercy of God. They are appealed to in order to lead them to consider the
        goodness of God in former times, as exhibited in the issues of the
        afflictions with which He visited His people, not to separate them from
        His love, but to do them good in the latter end. ‘Ye have heard of the
        patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
        very pitiful, and of tender mercy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        How much consolation and joy should Christians experience in suffering
        affliction of any description whatever, when they can appeal to their
        Lord and Savior, and say, It is for ‘Thy sake,’ Matthew 5:11. So far
        from being separated from the love of Christ by such sufferings, they
        are by them made more conformable to His image. In suffering for evil,
        men are conformable to the image of the first Adam. We are killed. — In
        speaking of those sufferings, which shall not separate believers from
        God, the Apostle here refers to death, the highest point to which they
        can be carried. As to the time, he speaks of it as ‘all the day long;’
        that is, they are constantly exposed to the greatest measure of
        suffering in this life, and are frequently exercised with it. As to the
        manner, he says, We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. — The
        enemies of the people of God have often given them up to death with as
        little reluctance as sheep are driven to the slaughter. There is pity
        even for the murderer on the scaffold, but for Christ and His people
        there is none. The cry still is against the servants, as it was against
        the Master, ‘Crucify, crucify.’ Even in death they find no sympathy.
        This is attested by history in every age and country; witness the
        repeated and dreadful persecutions of Christians during the first three
        centuries, when they were treated not like men but as wild beasts, and
        the cry of the multitude was, ‘The Christians to the lions.’ When there
        is a respite from persecution, it is through the kind providence of God,
        when He restrains the malice of him who was a murderer from the
        beginning, and the evil passions of men, who are the willing instruments
        of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 37. — Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through
        Him that loved us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sufferings of believers above enumerated, which, as the Apostle had
        just shown, verify the truth of the ancient predictions of the word of
        God, shall not separate them from the love of Christ, but, on the
        contrary, are to them the sources of the greatest benefits. Through them
        they are more than conquerors. — This is a strong expression, but in its
        fullest import it is strictly true. The Christian not only overcomes in
        the worst of his trials, but more than overcomes his adversaries, and
        all those things which seem to be against him. It is possible to
        overcome, and yet obtain no advantage from The contest, nay, to find the
        victory a loss. But the Christian not only vanquishes, he is also a
        gainer by the assault of his enemy. It is better for him than if he had
        not been called to suffer. He is a gainer and a conqueror, both in the
        immediate fruits of his sufferings, as God overrules them for his good,
        bringing him forth from the furnace as gold refined, and also in their
        final issue; for ‘our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
        worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.’ The
        term conquerors reminds us that the life of a believer is a warfare, in
        which he is called to combat, both within and without. We may remark,
        too, the difference between the judgment of God, and the judgment of
        men, respecting the victory of believers. In the world, persecutors and
        oppressors are judged as the conquerors; but here, those are pronounced
        to be such, who are oppressed and persecuted. They are the servants of
        Him whom the world put to death, but who said to His disciples, ‘Be of
        good cheer, I have overcome the world.’ Through Him that loved us. — The
        Apostle says that we are more than conquerors, not through Him that
        loves us, but through Him that loved us, — using the past time, thus
        directing our attention to Christ dying for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        His love to us is the character by which Christ is often described, as
        if it were that by which He should be best known to us, and as if, in
        comparison, there was none but He alone who loved us. ‘Who loved me,’
        says the Apostle, ‘and gave Himself for me.’ ‘Who loved us, and washed
        us from our sins in His own blood.’ ‘Christ also loved the Church, and
        gave Himself for it.’ This expression shows that the confidence spoken
        of in this place is a confidence wholly grounded on Christ’s love and
        power, and not on our own firmness. It is not by our own loyalty and
        resolution, but through Him that loved us, that we are more than
        conquerors. In the Apostle Peter we see the weakness of all human
        affection and resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the glory, then, of this victory which we obtain is to be ascribed
        solely to God; for it is He who is at our right hand, and who supports
        us in all our afflictions. In the seventeenth chapter of the Book of
        Revelation, the Lamb, who is Jesus Christ, is represented as combating
        against the enemies of His Church. He is our shield, our rock, and our
        refuge. It is declared that we are ‘kept (as in a garrison) by the power
        of God,’ Peter 1:5, in order that we may not presume on our own
        strength, or attribute to ourselves the glory of our preservation; but
        that we may keep our eyes fixed upon Him who, with His outstretched arm,
        conducts us to the heavenly Canaan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 38. — Far I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
        nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verses Paul had proclaimed the triumph of believers
        over everything within and without them, that seemed to endanger their
        security. He had spoken of tribulation, and distress, and persecutions,
        and famine, and nakedness, and peril, and sword, over all of which he
        had pronounced them more than conquerors. He now proceeds, in the same
        triumphant language, to defy enemies still more formidable; asserting
        that all the conceivable powers of the universe shall not be able to
        separate them from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ. For I am
        persuaded — Here Paul introduces his own persuasion of the love of God
        to His people, that in so doing others may imitate him. This appears
        more fully in the next verse, by his making the constancy of God’s love
        a privilege not peculiar to himself, but common to all His people. He
        sets before believers this persuasion, to confirm them in the conviction
        that they need not fear the want of God’s support to enable them to
        overcome all trials, and surmount all dangers. For this persuasion is
        not conjectural, but an assured confidence, such as he expresses when he
        says, ‘I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to
        keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day,’ Timothy
        1:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we see the nature and quality of faith as opposed to the doctrine
        of the Church of Rome, which holds it to be merely a general belief of
        all that God has said, without confidence in His promises, or assurance
        of His grace. But the object of the Gospel, which is called ‘the Gospel
        of peace,’ is, that those who have fled for refuge to the hope set
        before them, should have strong consolation, Hebrews 6:18, and peace in
        their conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The words, ‘I am persuaded,’ used by the Apostle, about that faith is a
        persuasion, and a union and conformity of heart to the word which we
        believe. Our reception of the promises, then, is a special application
        of them, when we take home to ourselves the grace and love of God, as
        the Apostle does when he says, verse 39, that nothing shall be able to
        separate us, to prove that he speaks in the name of all believers, and
        that, in this triumph of faith, he employs language common to them all.
        The objection that the language he used was appropriate only to
        Apostles, would set aside his intention and object altogether. The
        Church of Rome, however, objects, that in order to this application of
        faith, the Gospel should speak to each individual by his name, and say,
        ‘Thou art saved, thou art pardoned.’ But if, as they admit, the law, by
        its general propositions, obliges every one to obey it, while it names
        no person individually, and in saying, ‘Cursed is every one who
        continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
        do them,’ condemns every man who does not yield obedience to its
        commands, why should they deny that the propositions of the Gospel
        comprise every believer in particular, or affirm that in saying, ‘He
        that believeth in Jesus hath eternal life,’ it does not speak to all who
        believe in Jesus, and declare that each one of them hath eternal life?
        When the law says, ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ ‘Thou shalt not steal,’ ought
        any one to doubt that these commandments are addressed to him? But, in
        the Gospel, we find the same manner of speaking. ‘If thou shalt confess
        with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God
        hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.’ Every believer,
        then, should rejoice in the declarations and promises of the Gospel, as
        if they were addressed to him by name. That neither death. — Death
        itself shall not separate believers from the love of God, nor should
        they question His love because He has appointed that they should die
        once. Death, with all its accompaniments, which are always solemn and
        sometimes terrible, may wear the semblance of God’s displeasure. But,
        notwithstanding the pains and sufferings by which it is usually
        preceded, especially when inflicted by persecution, to which there may
        be here a particular allusion, — notwithstanding the humiliating
        dissolution of the body into dust, — yet God is with His children when
        they walk through this dark valley, and ‘precious in the sight of the
        Lord is the death of His saints.’ In their death they have fellowship
        with Him who has disarmed it of its sting, and destroyed him that had
        the power of death. So far from separating them from God, it is His
        messenger to bring them home to Himself. If its aspect be terrible, it
        is still like the brazen serpent in the wilderness, which had but the
        form of a serpent, without its deadly poison. It dissolves the earthly
        house of their tabernacle, but introduces them into their house not made
        with hands, eternal in the heavens. It discharges the soul from the
        burden of sin, that it may be clothed with perfect holiness; for death,
        although the effect of sin, is the occasion of slaying and destroying it
        in the believer. Nor life. — This is the next thing that the Apostle
        enumerates as threatening to separate believers from the love of God. It
        includes all the dangers and difficulties they have to encounter while
        passing through this world, and carrying about with them a body of sin
        and death amidst the various temptations from prosperity or adversity to
        which they are exposed. Yet Christ is their shepherd, and the Holy
        Spirit their leader. So far from separating them from the love of God,
        life as well as death are included among the privileges which belong to
        the children of God, Corinthians 3:22.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor angels. — Some restrict this to good angels, and some to evil
        angels.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no reason why it should not include both. Mr. Stuart asks, How
        can the good angels, ‘who are sent forth to minister to such as are
        heirs of salvation ( Hebrews 1:14), be well supposed to be opposers and
        enemies of Christians?’ But how could Mr. Stuart pronounce such a
        judgment in the face of the Apostle himself on another occasion/ If ‘an
        angel from heaven preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we
        have preached unto you, let him be accursed.’ Could an angel from heaven
        be supposed a false preacher rather than a persecutor? But such
        suppositions are common in Scripture. They do not imply the possibility
        of the things supposed; and it fully justifies them, if the consequence
        would follow from the supposition, were it realized. By the expression,
        ‘nor height, nor depth,’ Mr. Stuart understands is meant neither heaven
        nor hell. Did he not observe, then, that this is inconsistent with his
        objection to explaining the term principalities and powers as referring
        to heavenly angels? If height means heaven, surely it is the inhabitants
        of the place who are meant, not the place itself. Nor principalities,
        nor powers. — This is also variously interpreted. Some confine it to
        angels, and some to civil rulers. There is no reason that it should not
        extend to the words in their widest meaning. It is true of civil powers;
        it is equally true of all angelic powers. It is as true with respect to
        principalities in heaven, as it is with respect to those in hell. Were
        all the principalities, through all creation, to use their power against
        Christians, it would not succeed. They have Christ on their side; who,
        then, can prevail against them? This justifies strong expressions in the
        exhibition of Divine truth. We are warranted by this to illustrate
        Scripture doctrine from the supposition of things impossible, in order
        the more deeply to impress the human mind with the truth inculcated.
        This fact is of great importance as to the explanation of Scripture. Nor
        things present, nor things to come. — Neither the trials nor afflictions
        in which the children of God are at any time involved, nor with which
        they may at any future period be exercised, will avail to separate them
        from Christ. There is nothing that can happen against which the
        providence of God does not secure them. What dangers should they dread
        when He says, ‘Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will
        help thee, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel’
        ‘When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
        the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the
        fire, thou shalt not be burnt; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
        For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior.’ Nothing
        does happen, nothing can happen, which, from eternity, He hath not
        appointed and foreseen, and over which He hath not complete control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 39. — Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
        to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor height, nor depth. — These expressions appear to comprise all that
        had been said of angels, principalities, and powers, including them
        altogether to give greater force to the declaration concerning them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wherever they were, or whatever other power might inhabit heaven above,
        or hell beneath, if either a part of them, or the whole in combination,
        were to assail those whom Jesus loves, it would be of no avail. A
        reference may also be made to the highest state of prosperity to which a
        man may be elevated, or the lowest degree of adversity to which he may
        be depressed — of honor or of reproach. Neither the situation of Solomon
        the king, amidst the splendors of royalty, nor that of Lazarus the
        beggar, clothed in rags and covered with sores, although both are
        dangerous in the extreme, shall separate the believer from the love of
        God. Nor any other Creature. — The Apostle here, in conclusion of his
        discourse, after his long enumeration, intending to accumulate into one
        word all possible created existence in the whole universe, adds this
        expression, which completes the climax. Any other creature, that is, any
        creature which at present or hereafter should exist, all being created
        by and for Jesus Christ, and subordinate to His power, — no such
        creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in
        Him. From all the evils above enumerated God has delivered His people,
        not that they should not suffer them, but that they should not be
        overcome by them. The love of God. — Here what was before called the
        love of Christ is called the love of God. Could such a variety of
        expressions be used if Christ were not God as well as the Father? Among
        all the uncertainties of this life, that which is certain and can never
        fail, is the love of God to His children. On this ground, Job, when
        deprived of all his earthly possessions, exclaims, ‘Though He slay me,
        yet will I trust in Him,’ Job 13:15. ‘My flesh and my heart faileth, but
        God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever,’ Psalm 73:26.
        In Christ Jesus our Lord. — The love of God is here declared to be in
        Christ Jesus, to show that it is not God’s love in general that is here
        referred to, but that covenant love with which God loves us as His
        children, His heirs, and joint heirs with His only-begotten and
        well-beloved Son. If it were simply said that God loves us, we might
        say, in reflecting on our sins, how can God love such sinful creatures
        as we are; and how can we assure ourselves of the continuance of His
        love, since we are daily sinning, and provoking Him to anger? The
        Apostle, therefore, sets forth to us Jesus Christ, who is the same
        yesterday, and to-day, and for ever, as the medium of this love, in
        order that while we see that we are sinners and worthy of condemnation
        we may regard ourselves as in Jesus Christ, in whom we are reconciled,
        and washed from our sins in His blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is this medium to which the Apostle refers when he says, ‘He hath
        made us accepted in the Beloved,’ and God ‘hath blessed us with all
        spiritual blessings in, heavenly places in Christ; ‘He hath chosen us in
        Him before the foundation of the world,’ Ephesians 1:4. As, then, Jesus
        Christ is the true object of the love of the Father, as He testified by
        the voice from heaven, so in Him He loves His people with an everlasting
        love. To Him He had given them from eternity, and has united them to Him
        in time, that He might love them in Him, and by Him. Thus the Father
        loves no man out of the Son. As the sins of men had rendered them
        enemies to God, His justice could never have permitted them to be the
        objects of His love, if He had not expiated their sins, and washed them
        in the blood of His Son. Whoever, then, is not or shall not be in
        Christ, is not loved by the Father, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
        As the Apostle John testifies that God hath given us life, and this life
        is in His Son, so the Apostle Paul here declares that God hath given us
        His love, but that this love is in Jesus Christ. Consequently, we should
        not look for its cause in our works, or in anything in ourselves, but in
        Jesus Christ alone. Its incomprehensible extent and eternal duration are
        seen in His own words, when, addressing His Father, He says, ‘And hast
        loved them, as Thou hast loved Me;’ and again, ‘Thou lovest Me before
        the foundation of the world,’ John 17:23.
      </p>
      <p>
        The love of God, then, to His people, flows entirely through Jesus
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men in general are fond of contemplating God as a God of benevolence.
      </p>
      <p>
        They attempt to flatter Him by praising His beneficence. But God’s love
        to man is exercised only through the atonement made to His justice by
        the sacrifice of His Son. Those, therefore, who rejoice Christ and hope
        to partake of God’s love through any other means than Christ’s
        all-powerful mediation, must fail of success. There is no other name
        under heaven given among men whereby a sinner can be saved. As there was
        no protection in Egypt from death by the destroying angel except in
        those houses that were sprinkled with the blood of the paschal lamb, so
        none will be saved in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
        judgment of God, except those who are sprinkled with the blood of
        atonement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order followed by the Apostle in all this discourse is very
        remarkable.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he challenges our enemies in general, and defies them all,
        saying, ‘If God be for us, who can be against us?’ Next, he shows, in
        detail, that neither the want of anything good, nor the occurrence of
        any evil, ought to trouble us. Not the want of any good, for ‘God hath
        not spared His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all; how, then,
        shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?’ Not the
        occurrence of any evil, for that would be either within us or without
        us. Not within us, for the evil that is within us is sin, and as to sin,
        ‘It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that
        died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of
        God, who also maketh intercession for us.’ Not anything without us, for
        it would be either in the creatures, or in God. Not in the creatures,
        for that would be ‘tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
        or nakedness, or peril, or sword.’ But ‘in all these things we are more
        than conquerors, through Him that loved us.’ Not in God, for then there
        must be variableness and change in His love. ‘Now,’ says the Apostle, ‘I
        am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
        principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
        height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
        from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.’ On this he
        rests the believer’s peace and assurance, and with these words he
        concludes his animated and most consolatory description of the victory
        and triumph of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, indeed, may the Gospel be called the wisdom of God. It harmonizes
        things in themselves the most opposite. Is it not astonishing to find
        the man, who before had declared that there was no good thing in him,
        here challenging the whole universe to bring a charge against any of the
        elect of God? With respect to every Christian, in one point of view, it
        may be asserted that there is nothing good in him; and in another, it
        may be as confidently asserted that there is in him nothing evil. How
        could Paul say of himself, after he was a partaker of the holiness of
        the Spirit of truth, that there was nothing good in him? It was as
        concerned his own corrupt human nature. On what principle could he say,
        Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It was as they are
        in Christ Jesus. This is beautifully exhibited, 1 Corinthians 1:30. God
        hath united us to Christ Jesus in such an intimate manner, that His
        obedience is our obedience; His sufferings are our sufferings; His
        righteousness is our righteousness, for He is made unto us
        righteousness. This fully explains the ground on which we stand
        righteous before God: we stand in Christ. He has taken away all our
        sins. He who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might be made the
        righteousness of God in Him. It is of the highest importance fully to
        understand our oneness with Christ. This will give the utmost confidence
        before God, while we entertain of ourselves the lowest opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides all the other strong grounds of consolation contained in this
        chapter, it incontrovertibly establishes the doctrine of the
        perseverance of the saints, which, though clearly exhibited in so many
        other parts of Scripture, is opposed by the Church of Rome, which
        teaches that believers may finally fall from the love of God, thus
        representing that love as variable and inconstant. They make the grace
        of God to depend on the will of man for its effect; and as the will of
        man is mutable, so they believe that the grace of God is likewise
        mutable; and, having ascribed to their free will the glory of
        perseverance, they have like many who call themselves Protestants, lost
        altogether the doctrine of the perseverance of believers unto eternal
        life. Closely connected with this doctrine of perseverance, is the
        believer’s knowledge of his acceptance with God, without which that of
        final perseverance, or, more properly speaking, the certainty of
        preservation by God, could impart to him no comfort. When one of these
        doctrines is mentioned in Scriptures, the other is generally referred
        to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of them are intimately connected with the Christian’s love to God,
        his joy and peace, and with his being filled with the fruits of
        righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to the praise and glory of God.
        The enemies of this doctrine insist that it sets aside the necessity of
        attending to good works. On the contrary, it establishes them, and
        obliges us to perform them, not from servile fear, but from gratitude,
        and filial love to our Heavenly Father. God combats for us against
        principalities, and powers, and all our enemies; we ought, therefore, to
        fight under His banner. The believer combats along with God, while the
        issue of the combat and all the victory is from God, and not from the
        believer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was one great object of the apostle to hold out strong consolation to
        all who had fled for refuge, to lay hold of the hope set before them,
        and to urge them to give all diligence to the full assurance of hope. In
        exhorting to the duties of the Christian life, they proceeded on the
        ground that those to whom they wrote had the knowledge of their interest
        in the mediation of Christ, of the forgiveness of their sins through His
        love, and of the enjoyment of the love of God, to whom, by that Spirit
        of adoption which they had received, they cried, ‘Abba, Father’ and from
        all their Epistles it appears that those whom they addressed enjoyed
        this assurance. Paul accordingly exhorts the believers at Ephesus not to
        grieve the Holy Spirit of God, whereby they were soaked unto the day of
        redemption, and immediately after enjoins on them the duty of forgiving
        one another, even as God, for Christ’s sake, had forgiven them. ‘Ye were
        sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord; walk as children
        of light.’ When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shalt ye
        also appear with Him in glory; mortify, therefore, your members which
        are upon the earth,’ Colossians 3:4. The Apostle Peter exhorts those to
        whom he wrote to love one another fervently, seeing they had purified
        their souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit. And the Apostle
        John enjoins on the little children, the young men, and the fathers, not
        to love the world, because their sins were forgiven; because they had
        known Him that is from the beginning, and because they had known the
        Father. The exhortations of the Apostles are in this manner grounded on
        the knowledge that those to whom they were directed were supposed to
        have of their interest in the Savior. Without this, the motives on which
        they are pressed to obedience would be unavailing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole strain of the apostolic Epistles is calculated to confirm this
        knowledge, which is referred to as the spring of that joy unspeakable
        and full of glory with which those who were addressed rejoiced, 1 Peter
        1:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their faith, then, must have been an appropriating faith, taking home to
        themselves individually, according to its measure, the promises of
        mercy, and enabling them to say each for himself, with the Apostle, ‘I
        am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I have; yet not I, but Christ
        liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the
        faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.’ No
        believer, without this persuasion that Christ gave Himself for him, and
        that he is ‘dead unto sin,’ and ‘alive unto God,’ should rest satisfied.
        If, in opposition to this, it be said that assurance of our interest in
        Christ is a gift of God, which He bestows as He sees good, it should be
        recollected that so also are all spiritual blessings; and if of these it
        is our duty diligently to seek for a continual supply and increase, it
        is our duty to seek for this personal assurance among the rest. It is
        glorifying to Christ our Savior, and highly important to ourselves. This
        assurance is what we are commanded to aim at, and to give all diligence
        to attain; and full provision is made for it in the Gospel, Hebrews
        6:11-20; 2 Peter 1:10. We enjoy this assurance of our salvation, when we
        are walking with God, and in proportion as we walk with Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full assurance of faith, in which believers are commanded to draw
        near to God, stands inseparably connected with having their hearts
        sprinkled from an evil conscience. An evil conscience accuses a man as
        guilty, as deserving: and liable to punishment, and keeps him at a
        distance from God.
      </p>
      <p>
        It causes him to regard the Almighty as an enemy and avenger, so that
        the natural enmity of the mind against God is excited and strengthened.
        On the contrary, a good conscience is a conscience discharged from
        guilt, by the blood of Christ. Conscience tells a man that the wages of
        sin is death, and that he has incurred the penalty; but when the
        atonement made by Christ is believed in, it is seen that our sins are no
        more ours, but Christ’s, upon whom God hath laid them all, and that the
        punishment due for sin, which is death, has been inflicted upon Him; the
        demands of the law have been fulfilled, and its penalty suffered. On
        this the believer rests, and his conscience is satisfied. It is thus
        purged from dead works, and this is what is called the answer of a good
        conscience toward God, 1 Peter 3:21. This answer of a good conscience
        cannot be disjoined from assurance of our acceptance with Him to whom we
        draw near; and the degree in which both this assurance, and a good
        conscience, are enjoyed, will be equal. As far, then, as the duty of a
        Christian’s possessing this assurance is denied, so far the duty of
        having the answer of a good conscience is not admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same also is true respecting the grace of hope. Hope is the anchor
        of the soul, to the attainment of the full assurance of which believers
        are commanded to give all diligence, and they are encouraged to hold
        fast the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. It is when they have
        the hope of beholding Jesus as He is that they purify themselves even as
        He is pure, 1 John 3:3. The ‘hope of salvation’ covers their heads in
        the combat in which they are engaged, which they are therefore commanded
        to put on, and wear as an helmet, 1 Thessalonians 5:8. In writing to the
        Thessalonians, the Apostle ascribes to God and the Lord Jesus Christ the
        everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace, which had been
        given to them. And he prays for the believers at Rome that the God of
        hope may fill them with all joy and peace in believing, and that they
        might abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        This good hope through grace, then, as well as a conscience purged from
        dead works — the duty of possessing which no Christian will deny — stand
        inseparably connected with the personal assurance of an interest in the
        Savior, and all of them lie at the foundation of love to God, and
        consequently of acceptable obedience to Him. We love Him when we see
        that He hath loved us, and that His Son is the propitiation for our
        sins. ‘Thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes, and I have walked in Thy
        truth,’ Psalm 26:3. ‘Lord, I have hoped for Thy salvation, and done Thy
        commandments,’ <19B9166> Psalm 119:166. In this manner was David led to
        serve God. When, according to the precious promise of our blessed Lord,
        the Spirit takes of the things that are His — the glory of His person,
        and the perfection of His work — and discovers them to us, we then know
        whom we have believed, the conscience is discharged from guilt; and
        thus, hoping in God, and having our hearts enlarged, we run the way of
        His commandments, <19B932> Psalm 119:32, and bring forth the fruits of
        the Spirit, love, joy, and peace. But how can there be love without a
        sense of reconciliation with God; and how can the fruits of joy and
        peace be brought forth till the conscience is discharged from guilt? It
        is earnestly and repeatedly enjoined on believers to rejoice in the
        Lord; but how can they rejoice in Him unless they have the persuasion
        that they belong to Him? ‘The joy of the Lord is your strength,’
        Nehemiah 8:10. ‘The end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure
        heart, and a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,’ 1 Timothy 1:5.
        Love flows from a pure heart, a pure heart from a good conscience, and a
        good conscience from true faith. The necessity of a good conscience, in
        order to acceptable obedience to God, is forcibly pointed out, Hebrews
        9:14. ‘How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
        Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
        dead works to serve the living God?’ Till this takes place, all a man’s
        doings are dead works , or, as the Apostle expresses it in the seventh
        chapter of this Epistle, ‘fruit unto death.’ An evil or guilty
        conscience leads a man to keep at a distance from God, like Adam, who,
        conscious of his guilt, hid himself among the trees of the garden. But
        when the conscience is made good, — that is, is at peace, — the heart is
        purified, and love is produced. Then, and not till then, when ascribing
        praise to the Lamb who has washed us from our sins in His own blood, and
        having a sense of reconciliation with God, and of the enjoyment of His
        favor, we serve Him in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the
        letter — not from servile fear, but with gratitude and filial affection.
        Thus, having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
        by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated for us through the
        vail, that is to say, His flesh; and having an High Priest over the
        house of God, we draw near with a true heart, in the full assurance of
        faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
        bodies washed with pure water. We enjoy the persuasion that by His mercy
        we are saved by the wishing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
        Ghost. ‘Come unto Me, and I will give you rest.’ What is this rest but
        that peace and repose of the soul which can never be found but in God?
        Then we can adopt the language of the Psalmist, ‘I will go unto God, my
        exceeding joy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Spirit of God being holy, will not produce Christian assurance
        without at the same time producing sanctification, and by this
        sanctification the persuasion is confirmed of our communion with God;
        for although our sanctification be imperfect, it is a certain mark of
        our election.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we feel a holy sadness for having offended God, we enjoy the
        blessedness of those who mourn, and are assured that we shall be
        comforted. When we hunger and thirst after righteousness, we have the
        promise that we shall be filled. This mourning for sin, and thirsting
        after righteousness, on which the Savior pronounces His blessing, can
        only proceed from the Spirit of God, and not from the desire of the
        carnal mind, which is enmity against God. The fruits of the Spirit are
        first produced by believing in Christ, trusting in Him, and regarding
        what He has done without us, and are increased and confirmed by what He
        is doing within us. Abounding in the fruits of righteousness, we make
        our calling and election sure. Keeping his commandments, we prove our
        love to our Savior, and He manifests Himself to us as He doeth not unto
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal application, or the appropriation of faith, is often signalized
        in Scripture. Moses says; ‘The Lord is my strength and my song, and He
        is become my salvation: He is my God,’ Exodus 15:2. Job says, ‘I know
        that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon
        the earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
        flesh shall I see God,’ Job 19:25. ‘I know,’ says David, ‘that God is
        for me,’ Psalm 56:9. ‘The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want,’ Psalm
        23:1. ‘The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup,’ Psalm
        16:5. ‘I will love thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and
        my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will
        trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower,’
        Psalm 18:1. ‘I know,’ says Paul, ‘whom I have believed.’ John says, ‘We
        have known and believed the love that God hath to us.’ Peter, classing
        himself with those to whom he wrote, blesses God that he and they were
        begotten again to a lively hope of an inheritance reserved in heaven;
        and, referring to their final perseverance, he adds, that they were
        ‘kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation.’ In the hope
        of that salvation, those who received the doctrine of the Apostles
        rejoiced as soon as it was announced to them, Acts 2:41, 8:39, 16:34.
        Their joy, then, had not its source in reflection on, or consciousness
        of, their faith, or its effects, although afterwards so confirmed, but
        arose, in the first instance, from the view they had of the glory and
        all-sufficiency of the Savior, and His perfect righteousness made theirs
        by faith, resting on the Divine warrant and promise, ‘In whom we have
        boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,’ Ephesians
        3:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the assurance of sense be confirmatory of the assurance of
        faith it is not so strong as the latter. ‘Sanctification,’ says
        Rutherford, ‘does not evidence justification as faith doth evidence it,
        with such a sort of clearness as light evidences colors, though it be no
        sign or evident mark of them; but as smoke evidences fire, and as the
        morning star in the east evidenceth the sun will shortly rise; or as the
        streams prove there is a head-spring whence they issue; though none of
        these make what they evidence visible to the eye; so doth sanctification
        give evidence of justification, only as marks, signs, effects, give
        evidence of the cause. But the light of faith, the testimony of the
        Spirit by the operation of free grace, will cause us, as it were, with
        our eyes, see justification and faith, not by report, but as we see the
        sun’s light.’
      </p>
      <p>
        If it be objected that a man cannot know that he has faith without
        seeing its effects; it is replied that this is contrary to fact. When a
        thing is testified, or a promise is made to us, we know whether or not
        we believe it, or trust in it. According to this objection, when Philip
        said, ‘If thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest,’ the eunuch
        should have replied, ‘You ask me to tell you a thing I cannot know;’ but
        instead of this, he answers, ‘I believe.’ When the Lord asked the blind
        man, ‘Believest thou in the Son of God?’ he did not ask a question which
        it was impossible to answer. Does the Spirit of God cry in the hearts of
        believers, ‘Abba, Father,’ and witness with their spirits that they are
        the children of God, without their being able to know it? If, however,
        the flesh raises doubts in the believer, from the weakness of his faith,
        he should consider that the weakness of his faith does not prevent it
        from being true faith; that God accepts not the perfection but the
        reality of faith; that Jesus Christ recognized the faith of him who
        said, ‘Lord, I believe; help Thou my unbelief; ‘and that these doubts
        are not in his faith, but opposed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are in the flesh, with the believer resists, and says with Paul,
        ‘Now, if I do what I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that
        dwelleth in me.’ ‘In the first act of believing,’ says Mr. Bell in his
        work On the Covenants , ‘sinners have no evidence of grace in
        themselves: they feel nothing within but sin; they see a word without
        them as the sole foundation of faith, and on that alone they build for
        eternity. This is a point of no small importance to saints and sinners.
        Many of the modern builders are at great pains to keep their hearers
        from all confidence till they first discern the evidences of grace in
        their hearts; and, having got evidence, then, and not till then, can
        they have any just, lawful, or well-grounded confidence, — nay, they
        seem pretty plainly to intimate that a sinner’s right to Christ turns on
        something wrought in him, or done by him, and till he have evidence of
        this, he can claim no interest in Christ, nor assure himself of
        salvation by Him. According to this, Christ, the Tree of Life, is
        forbidden fruit, which the sinner must not touch till he has seen inward
        evidence. I confess I have not so learned Christ. The sinner’s right to
        Christ turns not at all upon any inward gracious qualifications, but
        purely on the Divine warrant revealed in the word. Faith is not a
        qualification in order to come to Christ, but the coming itself; it is
        not our right to Christ, but our taking and receiving Him to ourselves
        on the footing of the right conveyed by the Gospel offer.’ ‘Tis a thing
        of huge difficulty,’ says Archbishop Leighton, ‘to bring men to a sense
        of their natural misery, to see that they have need of a Savior, and to
        look out for one. But then, being brought to that, ‘tis no less, if not
        more difficult, to persuade them that Christ is He; that as they have
        need of Him, so they need no more, He being able and sufficient for
        them. All the waverings and fears of misbelieving minds do spring from
        dark and narrow apprehensions of Jesus; Christ. All the doubt is not of
        their interest, as they imagine; they who say so, and think it is so, do
        not perceive the bottom and root of their own malady. They say they do
        no whit doubt but that He is able enough, and His righteousness large
        enough, but all the doubt is, if He belong to me. Now, I say this doubt
        arises from a defect and doubt of the former, wherein you suspect it
        not. Why doubtest thou that He belongs to thee? Dost thou fly to Him, as
        lost and undone in thyself? Dost thou renounce all that can be called
        thine, and seek thy life in Him? Then He is thine. He came to seek and
        to save that which was lost .
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh I but I find so much not only former but still daily renewed and
        increasing guiltiness. Why? Is He a sufficient Savior, or is He not? If
        thou dost say He is not, then it is manifest that here lies the defect
        and mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        If thou sayest He is, then hast thou answered all thy objections of that
        kind: much guiltiness much or little, old or new, neither helps nor
        hinders, as to thy interest in Him, and salvation by Him. And for
        dispelling of these mists, nothing can be more effectual than the
        letting in of those Gospel beams, the clear expressions of His riches
        and fullness in the Scriptures, and eminently this — made of God wisdom
        and righteousness.’ The religion of the Church of Rome leaves a man
        nothing but doubts respecting his salvation. It teaches, as has been
        formerly remarked, that a Christian should believe in general the
        promises of God, while personal application of these promises, and
        assurance of God’s love, it calls presumption. This subject was one of
        the grand points of discussion between that church and the Reformers.
        But how many Protestants have forsaken the ground which their
        predecessors here occupied, and have gone over to that of their
        opponents! The doctrine of the duty of our personal assurance of
        salvation, and the persuasion of our interest in Christ, is denied by
        many, and doubts concerning this are even converted into evidences of
        faith, although they are directly opposed to it. Doubts of a personal
        interest in Christ, are evidences either of little faith or of no faith.
        ‘O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?’ If this assurance
        were built on anything except on the foundation that God Himself hath
        laid, it would indeed be eminently presumptuous. But, in opposition to
        such opinions, the Apostle John has written a whole Epistle to lead
        Christians to this assurance. ‘He that believeth on the Son of God hath
        the witness in himself. He that believeth not God hath made Him a liar:
        because He believeth not the witness which God hath witnessed concerning
        His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this is the witness, that God hath given to us eternal life; and
        this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that
        hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto
        you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye
        have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of
        God.’ ‘This assurance,’ says Archbishop Leighton, ‘is no enemy to holy
        diligence, nor friend to carnal security; on the contrary, it is the
        only thing that doth eminently enable and embolden the soul for all
        adventures and services. Base fears and doubtings, wherein some place
        much of religion, and many weak Christians seem to be in that mistake,
        to think it a kind of Holy Spiritual temper to be questioning and
        doubting. I say, then, base fears can never produce anything truly
        generous, no height of obedience, — they do nothing but entangle and
        disable the soul for every good work; perfect love casts out this fear,
        and works a sweet unperplexing fear, a holy wariness, not to offend,
        which fears nothing else. And this confidence of love is the great
        secret of comfort, and of ability to do God service. Nothing makes so
        strong and healthful a constitution of soul as pure love: it dare submit
        to God and resign itself to Him; it dare venture itself in His hand, and
        seeks no more but how to please Him. A heart thus composed goes readily
        and cheerfully unto all services, to do, to suffer, to live, to die, at
        His pleasure; and firmly stands to this, that nothing can separate from
        that which is sufficient to it, what is all its happiness, the love of
        God in Christ Jesus.’ ‘It is true that all Christians have not alike
        clear and firm apprehension of their happy and true state, and scarce
        any of them are alike at all times; yet they have all and always the
        same right to this state and to the comfort of it; and where they stand
        in a right light to view it, they do see it so, and rejoice in it. Many
        Christians do prejudice their own comfort, and darken their spirits, by
        not giving freedom to faith to act according to its nature and proper
        principles; they will not believe till they find some evidence or
        assurance, which is quite to invert the order of the thing, and to look
        for fruit without settling a root for it to grow from. Would you take
        Christ upon the absolute word of promise tendering Him to you, and rest
        on Him, this would ingraft you into life itself, for that He is; and so
        those fruits of the Holy Ghost would bud and flourish in your hearts.
        From that very believing on Him would arise this persuasion, yea, even
        to a gloriation, and an humble boasting in His love, — who shall accuse?
        who shall condemn ? who shall separate? ’ In opposition to the
        believer’s personal assurance of salvation, Satan will represent to him
        the number and enormity of his sins, and the strictness of God’s
        justice, which has often fallen on those whom He hardens. But believers
        will answer, ‘We know that to God belongeth righteousness, and unto us
        confusion of faces, but mercy and pardon belong to the Lord our God. If
        our sins ascend to heaven, His mercy is above the heavens. It is true
        that sin abounds in us; but where sin abounded grace and mercy have much
        more abounded; and the greater our misery, the greater towards us is the
        glory of the mercy of God. In entering into paradise, our Lord Jesus
        Christ has not taken with Him angels, but the spirit of a malefactor,
        that we might know that the greatest sinners are objects of His
        compassion. He came into the world to save sinners, and He calls to
        Himself those who are heavy laden with sin. He came to proclaim liberty
        to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.
        The more, then, that we feel the power of sin, the closer we cleave to
        Him. If Peter, affrighted, exclaimed, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful
        man, O Lord,” let us, on the contrary, say, Lord Jesus, we come to Thee,
        and the more so because we are sinners; for Thou hast been made sin for
        us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
        Thee. We have sinned seventy times, and seventy times have fallen again
        into sin; but God, who commands us to forgive offenses even seventy
        times seven, will many more times pardon! In comparison of His love, the
        love of man is not as a drop to the ocean.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation on which believers repel doubts concerning their
        salvation rests on the excellence of their Mediator, His love and
        compassion for them, the merit of His obedience, and their communion
        with Him. As to the excellence of their Mediator, He is the eternal Son
        of God, the Beloved of the Father, for whom they are beloved in Him, and
        His intercession for them is acceptable to God and efficacious. ‘We have
        a great High Priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of
        God.’ ‘He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
        Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.’ It rests on
        the love and compassion of Jesus. ‘For we have not an High Priest which
        cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all
        points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.’ His love to us has been
        stronger than death; and He Himself saith, ‘Greater love hath no man
        than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’ Having thus
        given Himself for us, will He reject us? Having ascended to heaven, will
        He forget us, for whom He descended to earth and for whom, as the
        forerunner, He hath again entered heaven to intercede for us, to prepare
        a place, and to receive us to Himself?
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers rest their assurance of salvation on the merit of their
        Redeemer’s obedience; for when their sins are red as crimson, they shall
        be made white as snow. Our robes have been washed in the blood of the
        Lamb, whose blood cleanseth us from all sin. It is impossible that sin
        can be more powerful to destroy us, than the grace of God and the merit
        of Jesus Christ to save us. We are condemned by the law; but, in answer
        to the law, we plead the blood of Jesus Christ, who hath borne the curse
        of the law, and who is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
        that believeth. We have been condemned by the justice of God; but to
        this justice we present the righteousness of Christ, who is ‘Jehovah our
        righteousness.’ God hath been angry with us; but in Jesus Christ He hath
        not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in
        Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the temptations of Satan, believers also oppose their union with
        Jesus Christ; for Jesus Christ and they are one. We are His members,
        bone of His bones, and flesh of His flesh; His obedience is our
        obedience; for as we are one body with Him, we appear before our God in
        Him. We are found in Him, not having our own righteousness, which is of
        the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
        righteousness which is of God by faith. By union with Him we are already
        seated together in heavenly places in Christ. As Jesus Christ has risen
        to die no more, but to live eternally, it follows that the righteousness
        which He has wrought is an everlasting righteousness, and that, being
        united to Him as His members, we derive from Him a life which cannot
        fail, so that we shall never die; for as the risen Head dies no more,
        and His life is an everlasting life, in like manner, whoever receives
        spiritual life from Him, receives a life which can never terminate.
        Hence it follows that the resurrection of Jesus Christ, assuring us of
        our justification and eternal life, is a source of the greatest joy and
        consolation. The Psalmist, accordingly, prophesying of the resurrection
        of Christ, says ‘that his heart is glad, and his glory rejoiceth.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The first words of Jesus Christ to Mary, after His resurrection, were,
        ‘Woman, why weepest thou?’ and to the other women, ‘Be not afraid;’ and
        to the disciples, ‘Why are ye troubled?’ His resurrection ought to wipe
        away the tears of His people, to tranquilize their minds, and dissipate
        their fears, by the assurance it gives of their acquittal from
        condemnation before God, and of the destruction of him who had the power
        of death. ‘The words of Jesus, above referred to,’ says an eloquent
        writer, ‘are generally applicable to the life of a Christian. He can
        look upon that rich field of privilege and of promise placed before him
        in the Bible, and can say that it is all his own. And where is the want
        that the blessed fruits of that field cannot supply, the distress which
        they cannot relieve, the wound that they cannot heal, the fear that they
        cannot quiet, or the sorrow for which they do not furnish abundant
        consolation? Where, then, is the cause of depression? Friend of Jesus,
        why weepest thou? If you have an Advocate with the Father, through whom
        you sins are all forgiven, and you are made a child of God, — and the
        Holy Ghost is given you as your Sanctifier and Comforter, — and you are
        assured of having almighty power for your support, and unerring wisdom
        for your guide, and heaven for your eternal home — what can overbalance
        or suppress the joy which naturally results from such privileges as
        these? Trials we may, we must, meet with; but can these depress us, when
        we know that our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for
        us a far more exceeding, even an eternal weight of glory? If tried by
        bodily pain, we feel more keenly the happiness of the hope which
        anticipates the time when we shall have a building of God, a house not
        made with hands, eternal in the heavens! Worldly losses will not
        overwhelm us, if we know that we are undoubted heirs of an inheritance
        that is incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. Friends may
        change, but we will be comforted by the assurance that in Christ we have
        a brother born for adversity, — nay, a friend that sticketh closer than
        a brother. There rolls between us and our Father’s house the deep and
        restless tide of this world’s corruption, through which we must of
        necessity pass, and the deeper and still more dangerous tide of the
        corruption of our hearts, and we are surrounded by enemies on every
        side; and when we feel our own weakness, we may be ready to fear lest we
        should one day fall by the hand of some of them. But every distressing
        fear is removed, when we recollect that we shall not be tempted beyond
        what we are able to bear, and that, in point of fact, there is no limit
        to our power, for we can do all things through Christ strengthening us,
        and that the life that is in us is the life of Christ, a life which no
        power can extinguish in any one of Christ’s members, any more than it
        can extinguish it in our glorious Head.’
      </p>
      <p>
        From the 28th verse to the conclusion of the chapter, the greatest
        encouragement is held out to repose all our confidence on the love of
        God in Christ Jesus, with the assured conviction that, receiving Him, we
        shall be enabled to persevere unto the end. The impossibility of
        plucking His people out of the Savior’s hand is here established in the
        most triumphant manner. Whatever objection is raised against it, is
        contrary to the power of Jesus Christ, contrary to His love, to the
        virtue of His sacrifice, and to the prevalence of His intercession, —
        contrary to the operation of the whole Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy
        Ghost, in every part of the plan of salvation. If we look upwards or
        downwards, — to heaven above, or the earth or hell beneath, — to all
        places, to all creatures, — neither any nor all of them together shall
        prevail against us. Were heaven and earth to combine, and all the powers
        of hell to rise up, they would avail nothing against the outstretched
        arm of Him who makes us more than conquerors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of Jesus, who is our Head, ascends above the heavens, and
        descends beneath the depths; and in His love there is a breadth, and
        length, and depth, and height, which passeth knowledge. ‘Thy mercy, O
        Lord, is in the heavens, and Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.
        Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; Thy judgments are a great
        deep,’ Psalm 36:5. Can anything prevail to pluck out of the hands of
        Jesus Christ those who have fled to Him as their surety, — those who are
        members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones, — those whom He
        hath purchased with His precious blood?
      </p>
      <p>
        The feelings of the believer, viewed in Christ, as described in the
        close of this chapter, form a striking contrast with what is said in the
        end of the former chapter, where he is viewed in himself. In the
        contemplation of himself as a sinner, he mournfully exclaims, ‘O
        wretched man that I am!’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the contemplation of himself as justified in Christ, he boldly
        demands, Who shall lay anything to my charge? Who is he that condemneth?
        Well may the man who loves God defy the universe to separate him from
        the love of God which is in Christ Jesus his Lord. Although at present
        the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together, although
        even he himself groaneth within himself, yet all things are working
        together for his good. The Holy Spirit is interceding for him in his
        heart; Jesus Christ is interceding for him before the throne; God the
        Father hath chosen him from eternity, hath called him, hath justified
        him, and will finally crown him with glory. The Apostle had begun this
        chapter by declaring that there is no condemnation to them who are in
        Christ Jesus: he concludes it with the triumphant assurance that there
        is no separation from His love. The salvation of believers is complete
        in Christ, and their union with Him indissoluble.
