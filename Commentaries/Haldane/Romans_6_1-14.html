      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        IN the preceding part of the Epistle the universal depravity and guilt
        of man, and the free salvation through the blood of the Lord Jesus
        Christ, had been fully exhibited. Paul now proceeds to prove the
        intimate connection between the justification of believers and their
        sanctification. He commences by stating an objection which has in all
        ages been advanced as an unanswerable argument against salvation by
        grace. He asks, What is the consequence of the doctrine he has been
        inculcating? If justification be bestowed through faith, without works,
        and if, where sin abounded, grace has much more abounded, may we not
        continue in sin that grace may abound? No objection could be more
        plausible. It is such as will forcibly strike every natural man, and is
        as common now as it was in the days of the Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul repels this charge by declaring the union of believers with Jesus
        Christ, by whom, as is represented in baptism, His people are dead to
        sin, and risen with Him to walk in newness of life. Having established
        these important truths, he urges (ver. 11) on those whom he addresses
        the duty of being convinced that such is their actual state. In verses
        12 and 13, he warns them not to abuse this conviction; and for their
        encouragement in fighting the good fight of faith, to which they are
        called, assures them, in the 14th verse, that sin shall not have
        dominion over them, because they are not under the law but under grace.
        Thus the Apostle proves that, by the gracious provision of the covenant
        of God, ratified by the blood of Him with whom they are inseparably
        united, they who are justified cannot continue to live in sin; but
        though sin shall not have dominion over them, still, as their
        sanctification is not yet perfect, he goes on to address them as liable
        to temptation. What he had said, therefore, concerning their state as
        being in Christ, did not preclude the duty of watchfulness; nor, since
        they had formerly been the servants of sin, of now proving that they
        were the servants of God, by walking in holiness of life. Paul concludes
        by an animated appeal to their own experience of the past, and to their
        prospects for the future. He asks, what fruit had they in their former
        ways, which could only conduct to shame and death? On the other hand, he
        exhorts them to press onwards in the course of holiness, at the end of
        which they would receive the crown of everlasting life. But, along with
        this assurance, he reminds them of the important truth, that while the
        just recompense of sin is death, eternal life is the gift of God,
        through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1 :— What shall we say then? Shall use continue in sin, that Grace
        may abound?
      </p>
      <p>
        What shall we say then? — That is, what conclusion are we to draw from
        the doctrine previously taught? The question is first asked generally.
        In the following words it is asked particularly, — Shall we continue in
        sin, that grace may abound? Many expound this objection as coming from a
        Jew, and imagine a sort of dialogue between him and the Apostle. For
        this there is no ground. The supposition of a dialogue in different
        parts of this Epistle, has been said to give life and interest to the
        argument; but instead of this, it is only cumbersome and entangling.
        There is no necessity for the introduction of an objector. It is quite
        sufficient for the writer to state the substance of the objection in his
        own words.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was essential for the Apostle to vindicate his doctrine, not only
        from such objections as he knew would be made by the enemies of the
        cross of Christ, to whom he has an eye throughout the whole of the
        Epistle, but also to Christians themselves, whom he was directly
        addressing. We see in his answer in the following verses, to the
        questions thus proposed, what an ample field it opened for demonstrating
        the beautiful harmony of the plan of salvation, and of proving how every
        part of it bears upon and supports the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer
        therein?
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul, in his usual manner on similar occasions, strongly rejects such a
        consequence as the question in the first verse supposes, and asks
        another, which implies the absolute incongruity of the assumption that
        Christians will be emboldened to continue in sin, by the knowledge of
        their being freely justified. On the very ground on which the objection
        rests, he shows that this is impossible. We that are dead to sin. — The
        meaning of this expression is very generally misunderstood, and extended
        to include death to the power of sin, to which it has not the smallest
        reference. It exclusively indicates the justification of believers, and
        their freedom from the guilt of sin, having no allusion to their
        sanctification, which, however, as the Apostle immediately proceeds to
        prove, necessarily follows. It was indispensable, in the view of
        obviating the objection proposed, distinctly to characterize both the
        persons, and their state of justification, to whom the answer he was
        about to give applied. Accordingly, by using the term we, he shows that
        he speaks of the same persons of whose justification he had been
        treating in the conclusion of the fourth, and in the first part of the
        foregoing chapter, to whom, in this way, he there refers more than
        twenty times. Their justification he expresses by the term dead to sin ,
        which, though only a part of justification, implies all that it
        includes. No other designation could have been so well adapted to
        introduce the development of their state, and its inseparable
        consequences, as contained in the following verses. This term, then, is
        most appropriately employed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formerly, the persons spoken of were dead in sin, but now they were dead
        to it, as it is said in the 7th verse, they are justified from it. In
        the seventh chapter, it is affirmed that believers are dead to the law.
        They are therefore dead to sin, for the strength of sin is the law; and
        consequently sin has lost its power to condemn them, their connection
        with it, in respect to its guilt, being for ever broken. In the 10th
        verse, it is said that Christ died unto sin, and liveth to God; and in
        the same way believers have died to sin, and are alive to God, to serve
        Him in newness of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has indeed been argued, that if the expression dead to sin does not
        comprehend death to the power of sin, it does not contain an answer to
        the objection urged in the preceding verse. Even, however, though the
        power of sin were included, it could not be considered as an answer by
        which the objection was removed, but simply a denial of its validity.
        But it is not intended as an answer, though it clearly infers that union
        with Jesus Christ which is immediately after exhibited as the complete
        answer. Without this union we cannot be dead to sin; but, being united
        to Him, believers are not only dead to it, but also, by necessary con
        sequence, risen with Him to walk in newness of life. Nothing could be
        more conclusive than in this manner to show that, so far from the
        doctrine of justification leading to the evil supposed, on the contrary,
        it provides full security against it. Paul accordingly presents that
        very aspect of this doctrine, namely, death to sin, which peculiarly
        bears on the point and this for the purpose of introducing that union by
        which it takes place, which is at once the cause both of justification
        and sanctification. So far, therefore, from these being contrary the one
        to the other, or of the first being in the smallest degree opposed to
        the last, they are in separable; and thus the possibility of those who
        are justified continuing in sin, that grace may abound, is absolutely
        precluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight translates the phrase, ‘dead to sin, have died by sin.’
        This does not convey the Apostle’s meaning, but an idea altogether
        different, and entirely misrepresents the import of the passage. All men
        have died by sin, but believers only are dead to the guilt of sin; and
        it is of its guilt exclusively that the Apostle here speaks. Unbelievers
        will not, through all eternity, be dead to sin. Dr. Macknight says that
        the common translation ‘is absurd, for a person’s living in sin who is
        dead to it, is evidently a contradiction in terms.’ But had he
        understood the meaning of the expression ‘dead to sin,’ he would have
        seen that there is nothing in this translation either contradictory or
        absurd. He ought also to have observed that the phraseology to which he
        objects is not an assertion that they who are dead to sin live in it,
        but is a question that supposes the incompatibility of the thing
        referred to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart also totally misunderstands the signification of the
        expression ‘dead to sin,’ which, he says, ‘means to renounce sin; to
        become, as it were, insensible to its exciting power and influence, as a
        dead person is incapable of sensibility.’ The clause that follows —
        Shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? — he interprets
        thus: ‘How shall we, who have renounced sin, and profess to be
        insensible to its influence, any more continue to practice it, or to be
        influenced by it?’ On this it is remarked, in the Presbyterian Review
        that ‘the objection stated by the Apostle is, that the tendency of his
        doctrine of justification by faith was bad, leading to licentiousness;
        and what sort of refutation is it to reply, whatever its tendency may
        be, nevertheless it should not produce such effects, because we have
        professed otherwise? Professions might be multiplied a thousand fold,
        and yet the tendency of the doctrine would remain the same, and the
        objection consequently would remain in all its force. Nay, it is plain
        that such a reply as this takes for granted that the tendency of the
        doctrine by itself is to licentiousness; and that, in order to prevent
        these its natural effects from being developed, the person who receives
        it must be hemmed around with innumerable professions and obligations to
        renounce those sins into which he might naturally be led by such a
        doctrine standing alone.’ Mr. Stuart’s explanation of becoming
        insensible to the exciting power or influence of sin, as a dead person
        is incapable of sensibility, perfectly coincides with the popish
        interpretation of the passage: — ’The spirit, the heart, the judgment,
        have no more life for sin than those of a dead man for the world.’ But
        the Roman Catholic Quesnel, perceiving that his interpretation is
        contradicted by experience, immediately adds: ‘Ah, who is it that is
        dead and insensible to the praises, to the pleasures, to the advantages
        of the world?’ Mr. Stuart, however, disregarding both fact and
        experience, adheres to his interpretation, and announces the third time,
        ‘To become dead to sin or to die to sin plainly means, then, to become
        insensible to its influence, to be unmoved by it; in other words, to
        renounce it, and refrain from the practice of it.’ This is justly
        chargeable with the absurdity unjustly charged by Dr. Macknight on the
        common translation of the passage. The assertion, then, would be, as we
        refrain from the practice of sin, we cannot continue to practice it.
        According to Mr. Stuart’s interpretation, when it is enjoined on
        believers, verse 11, to reckon themselves dead to sin, the meaning would
        be, that they should reckon themselves perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to understand the manner in which the Apostle meets and
        obviates the objection that the doctrine of justification by grace tends
        to encourage Christians to continue in sin, the ground on which he
        founds his denial of its validity must be particularly attended to. He
        does not rest it, according to Dr. Macknight, on the impossibility of
        believers ‘hoping to live eternally by continuing in sin,’ if they have
        died by it. This would not only be no adequate security against such an
        effect, but, owing to the strength of human depravity, no security at
        all. Neither does he rest it on their having ceased, according to Mr.
        Stuart, to feel the influence of sin, which is alike contrary to
        Scripture and experience. Nor, according to Mr. Tholuck, because ‘they
        obey it in nothing more,’ which is not only repugnant to truth, but
        would be simply a denial of the allegation without the shadow of proof.
        He rests it in no degree either on any motive presented to them, or on
        any change produced in themselves, as these writers suppose. It should
        also be observed that, when the Apostle characterizes believers as dead
        to sin, he is not introducing something new, as would be the case were
        either Dr. Macknight’s, or Mr. Stuart’s, or Mr. Tholuck’s explanation of
        the term correct. He is indicating the state of those to whom the
        objection applies, in order to its refutation. That it does not lead
        them to continue in sin, he had in effect shown already, in verses 3rd
        and 4th of the foregoing chapter, where he had declared the
        accompaniments of their justification. But as this objection is
        constantly insisted on, and is so congenial to human nature, and,
        besides, might appear plausible from the fact that they are the ungodly
        who are justified, ch. 4:5, he still considered it proper to meet it
        fully and directly. Paul therefore proceeds formally to repel such a
        calumny against his doctrine, by exhibiting in further detail, in the
        following verses, the grounds of justification to which he had referred,
        ch. 4:24, 25, — namely, the interest of believers both in the death and
        resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. The expression, then, dead to
        sin, does not in any degree relate to their character or conduct but
        exclusively to their state before God. Their character or conduct with
        regard to abstinence from the commission of sin, is referred to in the
        question that follows, demanding, How those who are dead to sin shall
        ‘live any longer therein? ’ But to explain the expression, ‘dead to
        sin,’ as meaning dead to the influence and love of sin, is entirely
        erroneous, and what the Apostle by no means asserts. Death to the
        influence and love of sin must involve their annihilation in the person
        of whom this could be affirmed; for death annihilates to its subject all
        things whatsoever; and in this case it might well be said, with Mr.
        Stuart, that a man who is dead to sin has ‘become insensible to its
        exciting power or influence, as a dead person is incapable of
        sensibility.’ How Mr. Stuart could make such statements, thrice
        repeated, yet totally unfounded, and flatly contradicted by every man’s
        experience, is indeed astonishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Utterly erroneous, too, is the explanation of other commentators, who
        say that the meaning is, dead to ‘the guilt and power’ of sin, — thus
        joining death to the power to death to the guilt , of sin. This
        indicates a condition with respect to sin which was never realized in
        any of the children of Adam while in this world. No believer is dead to
        the power of sin, as Paul has abundantly short in the seventh chapter of
        this Epistle. On the contrary, he there affirms that there was a law in
        his members which warred against the law of his mind; that he did the
        things he would not; and that when he would do good, evil (and what is
        this but the power of sin?) was present with him. The same truth is
        clearly exhibited in all the other Epistles, in which believers are so
        often reproved for giving way to the power of sin, and earnestly
        exhorted and warned against doing so. But when the expression is
        understood as exclusively signifying dead to the\parGUILT of sin, it may
        and must be taken in the full sense of what death imparts, being nothing
        less than absolute, total, and final deliverance from its guilt. To
        suppose, then, that in these words there is the smallest reference to
        the character or conduct of believers — to their freedom from the love
        or power of sin — to conjoin these in any respect or in any degree with
        their freedom from its guilt, — in other words, with their justified
        state, — is not merely to misapprehend the meaning of the Apostle, but
        to represent him as stating that to be a fact which has no existence;
        while it deprives the passage of the consolation to believers which,
        when properly understood, it is so eminently calculated to impart.
      </p>
      <p>
        In proof of the correctness of this view of the subject, let it be
        remembered that the Apostle’s refutation, in the following verses, of
        the supposed objection, does not rest on the supposition that sin is
        mortified in himself and those whom he is addressing, or that they are
        released from any propensity to it, but on the fact of their being one
        with Jesus Christ. They are united to Him in His death, and consequently
        in His life, which was communicated to them by Him who is a ‘quickening
        Spirit;’ and thus their walking with Him in newness of life, as well as
        their resurrection with Him, are secured. These ideas are exhibited in
        the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th verses. In the 7th verse, the reason of the
        whole is summed up, — ’For he who is dead (with Christ) is justified
        from sin;’ and in the 8th verse, that which will afterwards follow our
        being justified from sin is stated, — ’If we be dead with Christ, we
        believe that we shall also live with Him.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, in the 9th and 10th verses, the Apostle declares the
        consequence of Christ’s dying to sin to be, that He liveth unto God. The
        same effect in respect to the members must follow as to the Head with
        whom believers are one; and therefore he immediately proceeds to assure
        them, in the 14th verse, that sin shall not have dominion over them. The
        result, then, of the doctrine of justification by grace is the very
        reverse of giving not merely license, but even place, to continue in
        sin. On the contrary, according to that doctrine, the power of God is
        engaged to secure to those who are dead to sin — i.e., justified — a
        life of holiness, corresponding with that state into which, by their
        union with His Son, He has brought them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full import and consequence of being dead to sin will be found, ch.
        4:7, 8: — ’Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
        sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute
        sin.’
      </p>
      <p>
        They who are dead to sin, are those from whom, in its guilt or
        condemning power, it is in Christ Jesus entirely removed. Such persons,
        whose sins are thus covered, are pronounced ‘blessed.’ They enjoy the
        favor and blessing of God. The necessary effect of this blessing is
        declared in the new covenant, according to which, when God is merciful
        to the unrighteousness of His people, and remembers their sins and
        iniquities no more, He puts His laws into their mind, and writes them in
        their hearts, and promises that He will be to them a God, and they shall
        be to Him a people. In one word, they who are dead to Sin are limited to
        Him who is the Fountain of life and holiness, and are thus delivered
        from the curse pronounced upon those who, being under the law, continue
        not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.
        The guilt of their sins, which separated between them and God, having
        now been canceled, they enjoy His favor, and all its blessed effects. It
        is upon these great truths that the Apostle rests his absolute denial
        that the doctrine of justification by grace, which he had been
        unfolding, is compatible with continuing to live in sin. Live any longer
        therein. — To continue in sin, and to live any longer therein, are
        equivalent expressions, implying that, before their death to sin, the
        Apostle himself, and all those whom he now addressed, were enslaved by
        sin, and lived in it. In the same way, in writing to the saints at
        Ephesus, he says that formerly he and all of them had their conversation
        among the children of disobedience, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
        and of the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        By denying, then, that believers continue in sin, he does not mean to
        say that they never commit sin, or fall into it, or, according to Mr.
        Stuart, have become insensible to its influence, or to Mr. Tholuck, that
        they ‘obey it in nothing any more;’ for, as has been observed, it is
        abundantly shown in the seventh chapter, where he gives an account of
        his own experience (which is also the experience of every Christian),
        that this is very far from being a fact; but he denies that they
        continue to live as formerly in sin and ungodliness, which he had shown
        was impossible. Here it may, however, be remarked, that the full answer
        which in the following verses is given to the objection brought against
        the tendency of the doctrine of justification, cannot be understood by
        the natural man, to whom it must appear foolishness. Hence the same
        calumny is repeated to the present day against this part of Divine
        truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — Know ye not, that so many of was were baptized into Jesus
        Christ, were baptized into His death?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this and the following verses, Paul proceeds to give his full answer
        to the objection he had supposed, by showing that the sanctification
        believers rests on the same foundation, and springs from the same
        source, as their justification, namely, their union was Jesus Christ,
        and therefore, so far from their being contrary to each other, they are
        not merely in perfect harmony, but absolutely inseparable; and not only
        so, but the one cannot exist without the other. In the conclusion of the
        preceding chapter, he had declared that sin had reigned unto death. It
        reigned unto the death of Jesus Christ, the surety of His people, who,
        as is said in the 10th verse of the chapter before us, ‘died unto sin.’
        But as in His death its reign as to Him terminated, so its reign also
        terminated as to all His people, who with Him are ‘dead to sin.’ The
        effect, then, of His death being the termination of the reign of sin, it
        was at the same time to them the commencement of the reign of grace,
        which took place ‘through righteousness, — the everlasting righteousness
        brought in by His death.’ Instead, therefore, of being under the reign
        of sin, Christians are under grace, whereby they ‘serve God acceptably
        with reverence and godly fear,’ Hebrews 12:28. It may, however, be
        remarked, that although their union with Christ is the ground of the
        Apostle’s denial, that believers will be induced to continue in sin that
        grace may abound, and of their absolute security that this shall not be
        its effect, yet he does not fail to present, as in the concluding part
        of this chapter, such motives to abstain from sin as are calculated
        powerfully to influence their conduct. The consideration, too, that they
        died with Christ, and are risen with Him to newness of life, connected
        with the certainty that they shall live with Him in future glory,
        announced in the 5th and 8th verses, furnishes the strongest motives to
        the love of God, which is the grand spring of obedience, for we love Him
        when we know that He has first loved us. That this view of the death of
        Christ, and of our death with Him, operates as a powerful motive to the
        love of God, is shown, Corinthians 5:14, where it is said, ‘The love of
        Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all,
        then were all dead (or all died). And that he died for all, that they
        which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him
        which died for them, and rose again.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Although, then, the solid ground and absolute security that believers
        shall not live in sin, is shown to consist in their union with Christ,
        yet motives are not excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verse before us, the Apostle proves that Christians are dead to
        sin, because they died with Christ. The rite of baptism exhibits
        Christians as dying, as buried, and as risen with Christ. Know ye not. —
        He refers to what he is now declaring as a thing well known to those
        whom he addresses. Baptized into Jesus Christ. — By faith believers are
        made one with Christ: they become members of His body. This oneness is
        represented emblematically by baptism. Baptized into His death. — In
        baptism, they are also represented as dying with Christ. This rite,
        then, proceeds on the fact that they have died with Him who bore their
        sins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus the satisfaction rendered to the justice of God by Him, is a
        satisfaction from them, as they are constituent parts of His body. The
        believer is one with Christ as truly as he was one with Adam — he dies
        with Christ as truly as he died with Adam. Christ’s righteousness is his
        as truly as Adam’s sin was his. By a Divine constitution, all Adam’s
        posterity are one with him, and so his first sin is really and truly
        theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        By a similar Divine constitution, all Christ’s people are one with Him,
        and His obedience is as truly theirs as if they had yielded it, and His
        death as if they had suffered it. When it is said that Christians have
        died with Christ, there is no more figure than when it is said that they
        have died in Adam.
      </p>
      <p>
        The figure of baptism was very early mistaken for a reality, and
        accordingly some of the fathers speak of the baptized person as truly
        born again in the water. They supposed him to go into the water with all
        his sins upon him, and to come out of it without them. This indeed is
        the case with baptism figuratively. But the carnal mind soon turned the
        figure into a reality. It appears to the impatience of man too tedious
        and ineffectual a way to wait on God’s method of converting sinners by
        His Holy Spirit through the truth, and therefore they have effected this
        much more extensively by the performance of external rites. When,
        according to many, the rite is observed, it cannot be doubted that the
        truth denoted by it has been accomplished. The same disposition has been
        the origin of Transubstantiation. The bread and wine in the Lord’s
        Supper are figuratively the body and blood of Christ; but they have been
        turned into the real body, blood, soul, and divinity of the Lord, and
        the external rite has become salvation. So many of us. — This does not
        imply that any of those to whom the Apostle wrote were not baptized, for
        there could be no room for such a possibility. It applies to the whole
        of them, as well as to himself, and not merely to a part. It amounts to
        the same thing as if it had been said, ‘We who were baptized;’ as in
        Acts 3:24, ‘As many as have spoken,’ that is, all who have spoken, for
        all the Prophets spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Therefore we are buried with him baptism into death: that like
        as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even
        so we also should walk in newness of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The death of Christ was the means by which sin was destroyed, and His
        burial the proof of the reality of His death. Christians are therefore
        represented as buried with Him by baptism into His death, in token that
        they really died with Him; and if buried with Him, it is not that they
        shall remain in the grave, but that, as Christ arose from the dead, they
        should also rise. Their baptism, then, is the figure of their complete
        deliverance from the guilt of sin, signifying that God places to their
        account the death of Christ as their own death: it is also a figure of
        their purification and resurrection for the service of God. By the glory
        of the Father. — The exercise of that almighty power of God, by which,
        in various passages, it is asserted that Christ was made alive again,
        was most glorious to God who raised Him up. Christ’s resurrection is
        also ascribed to Himself, because He was a partaker with the Father of
        that power by which He was raised. ‘I lay down my life, that I might
        take it again.’ ‘Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
        up.’ To reconcile these and similar passages with those that ascribe His
        resurrection to the Father, it must be observed, that if the principle
        be regarded by which our Lord was raised up, it is to be referred to
        that Divine power which belongs in common to the Father and the Son. The
        Son was raised equally by His own power as by that of His Father,
        because He possessed the Divine as well as the human nature. But as in
        the work of redemption the Father acts as the sovereign ruler, it is He
        who has received the satisfaction, and who, having received it, has
        given to the Son its just recompense in raising Him from the dead. His
        resurrection, then, in this view, took place by the decree of the
        Eternal Father, pronounced from His judgment throne. Even so we also
        should walk in newness of life. — It is the purpose of our rising with
        Christ, that we also, by the glory or power of the Father, Corinthians
        13:4, should walk in newness of life. The resurrection of Christ was the
        effect of the power of God, not in the ordinary way of nature, but of a
        supernatural exertion of power. In the same manner, believers are raised
        to walk in newness of life. It is thus that, when Paul, Ephesians 1:20,
        exalts the supernatural virtue of grace by which we are converted, he
        compares it to the exceeding greatness of that power by which Christ was
        raised from the dead. This shows the force of the Apostle’s answer to
        the objection he is combating. Believers are dead to the guilt of sin,
        and if so, the ground of their separation from God being removed His
        almighty power is engaged and asserted to cause them to walk with their
        risen Lord in that new life which they derive from Him. It was, then,
        the purpose of Christ’s death that His people should become dead to sin,
        and alive unto righteousness. ‘Who His own self bare our sins in His own
        body on the tree, that we being dead to sins, should live unto
        righteousness,’ 1 Peter 2:24. On this same ground, when viewing it
        simply as a motive, Paul reminds believers that since they are dead with
        Christ, they should set their affections on things above, and not on
        things on the earth, assuring them that when He who is their life shall
        appear, then shall they also appear with Him in glory, Colossians 3:4.
        And again he declares, ‘If we be dead with Him, we shall also live with
        Him,’ 2 Timothy 2:11.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight is greatly mistaken when he applies what is said in this
        verse to the new life, which does not take place till after the
        resurrection of the body. This destroys the whole force of the Apostle’s
        reasoning, who is showing that believers cannot continue in sin, not
        only as they are dead to sin, but as they are risen with Christ, thus
        receiving a new and supernatural life, for the purpose of walking in
        obedience to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His
        death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection:
      </p>
      <p>
        For if. — The conditional statement is here evidently founded on what is
        premised. The Apostle does not pass to a new argument to prove that we
        are dead with Christ; but, having asserted the burial of the Christian
        with Christ in baptism, he goes on to show that his resurrection with
        Him is equally implied. If we have been buried with Christ, so we shall
        rise with Him. Planted together. — The word in the original, when it
        refers to trees, designates planting them in the same place or bed. It
        signifies the closest union of any kind, as being incorporated, growing
        together, joined with, united. The meaning, then, is, that as in baptism
        we have been exhibited as one with Christ in His death, so in due time
        we shall be conformed to Him in the likeness of His resurrection. We
        shall be. — The use here of the future tense has caused much perplexity
        respecting the connection of this verse with the preceding, and,
        contrary to its obvious meaning, the present time has been substituted.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, while the proper force of the future time is preserved, the two
        verses stand closely connected. Both a spiritual and a literal
        resurrection are referred to in the emblem of baptism; but, in the
        preceding verse, the former only is brought into view, as being that
        which served the Apostle’s immediate purpose. In this verse, in
        employing the future tense, he refers to the literal resurrection
        hereafter, as being inseparably connected with what he had just advanced
        concerning walking in newness of life; and thus he unfolds the whole
        mystery included in dying and rising with Christ, both in this world and
        the world to come. Believers have already been raised spiritually with
        Christ to walk with Him on earth in newness of life, and with equal
        certainty they shall be raised to live with Him in heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meaning is confirmed by what is said afterwards in the 8th and 9th
        verses. How powerful is this consideration, if viewed as a motive to the
        believer to walk in this world with his risen Lord in newness of life!
        ‘Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is
        pure,’ 1 John 3:3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — Knowing this that our old man is crucified with Him, that the
        body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
        Knowing this. — That is, assuming it as a thing with which they were
        already well acquainted, or a thing which they should know. That our old
        man was crucified with Him. — Paul draws here the same conclusion from
        the believer’s crucifixion with Christ that he had previously drawn from
        his baptism into Christ’s death. All believers died with Christ on the
        cross, as they were all one in Him, and represented by Him. Their old
        man, Ephesians 4:22; Colossians 3:9, or sinful nature, was crucified
        together with Christ. If, then, their old man has been crucified with
        Him, it cannot be that they will for the future live according to their
        old nature. That the body of sin might be destroyed. — Body of sin, that
        is, sin embodied, meaning the whole combination and strength of
        corruption, as having all its members Joined into a perfect body. The
        purpose of His people’s crucifixion with Christ was, that this body of
        sin should finally perish and be annihilated. It is called a body, as
        consisting of various members, like a complete and entire body — a mass
        of sin; not one sin, but all sin. The term body is used, because it is
        of a body only that there can be a literal crucifixion; and this body is
        called the body of sin, that it may not be supposed that it is the
        natural body which is meant. What henceforth we should not serve sin. —
        The design of the believer’s crucifixion with Christ is, that he may not
        henceforth be a slave to sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies that all men who do not believe in Christ are slaves to
        sin, as wholly and as absolutely under its power as a slave is to his
        master. But the end of our crucifixion with Christ, by faith in His
        death, is, that we may be delivered from this slavery. Believers, then,
        should resist sin as they would avoid the most cruel slavery. If this be
        the end of crucifixion with Christ, those cannot be considered as
        crucified with Christ who are the slaves of sin. Christians, then, may
        be known by their lives, as the tree is known by its fruits. It was the
        result of Paul’s crucifixion with Christ, that Christ lived in him. ‘I
        am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
        liveth in me,’ Galatians 2:20.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 7. — For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
      <p>
        For he that is dead; that is, dead with Christ, as is said in the
        following verse. — This does not mean natural death, but death in all
        its extent, signifying ‘the second death,’ the penalty of which Christ
        suffered, and therefore all His members have suffered it with Him. Freed
        from sin. — The original word, which is here translated freed, different
        from that rendered free in verses 18, 20, 22, is literally justified It
        occurs fifteen times in this Epistle, and twenty-five times in other
        parts of the New Testament; and, except in this verse, and one other
        where it is translated righteous, is uniformly rendered by the word
        justified. In this verse, as in all the other passages its proper
        rendering ought to be retained, instead of being exchanged for the term
        ‘freed,’ which has evidently been selected to convey a different sense.
        To retain its proper translation in this place is absolutely necessary,
        in order clearly to perceive the great and cheering truth here
        announced, as well as to apprehend the full force of the Apostle’s
        answer to the objection stated in the first verse. As to the phrase,
        ‘justified from sin,’ we find the Apostle expressing himself in the same
        manner ( Acts 13:39), ‘By Him all that believe are justified from all
        things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.’
      </p>
      <p>
        No objection can be made to the use of the expression ‘justified, since
        the Apostle is speaking of the state of believers, to which it is
        strictly applicable. In justification, which is a judicial and
        irrevocable sentence pronounced by God, there are two parts: the one
        includes absolution from the guilt of the breach of the law; the other,
        the possession of that obedience to its precepts which the law demands.
        These being inseparable, they are both included in the expression
        justified from sin. If a man be dead with Christ, he possesses, as has
        been observed, all the blessings which, according to the tenor of the
        new covenant, are included in, and connected with, the state of
        justification by grace. Instead, then, of encouraging him to continue in
        sin, it furnishes absolute security against such a result, and ensures
        the certainty that he shall walk in newness of life until he attains the
        possession of eternal glory. The Apostle, therefore, is so far from
        admitting that, according to the supposed objection which he is
        combating, gratuitous justification is opposed to sanctification, that,
        after having shown in the preceding verses that sanctification springs
        from union with Christ, he here asserts, as he had formerly proved, that
        on the very same ground the doctrine of justification is established.
        The one cannot, therefore, be hostile to the interests of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bond by which sinners are kept under the power of sin, is the curse
        of the law. This curse, which is the penalty of disobedience, consists
        in man being cut off from all communion with God. By throwing off his
        allegiance to his Creator, he has become the subject of the devil, and
        is led captive by him at his will. The curse consists in being given up
        to sin, which is represented as reigning over the human race, and
        exercising an absolute dominion. So long as the sinner is under the
        guilt of sin, God can have no friendly intercourse with him; for what
        communion hath light with darkness? But Christ having canceled His
        people’s guilt, having redeemed them from the curse of the law and
        invested them with the robe of His righteousness, there is no longer any
        obstacle to their communion with God, or any barrier to the free ingress
        of sanctifying grace. As the sin of the first man divested of holiness
        every one of his descendants, causing each individual to enter the world
        dead in trespasses and sins, in like manner the obedience of the second
        Adam imparts holiness to all His members, so that they can no longer
        remain under the thralldom of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Were a sinner, when he is redeemed, not also sanctified, it would argue
        that he was still under the curse, and not restored to the favor of God.
        Besides, what is the state of the believer? He is now united to Him who
        has the inexhaustible fullness of the Spirit, and he cannot fail to
        participate in the spirit of holiness which dwells without measure in
        his glorious Head. It is impossible that the ‘streams can be dried up
        when the fountain continues to flow; and it is equally impossible for
        the members not to share in the same holiness which dwells so abundantly
        in the Head. As the branch, when united to the living vine, necessarily
        partakes of its life and fatness, so the sinner, when united to Christ,
        must receive an abundant supply of sanctifying grace out of His
        immeasurable fullness. The moment, therefore, that he is by faith
        brought into union with the second Adam — the grand truth on which the
        Apostle had been insisting in the preceding part of this chapter, by
        means of which believers are dead to sin — in that moment the source of
        sanctification is opened up, and streams of purifying grace flow into
        his soul. He is delivered from the law whereby sin had dominion over
        him. He is one with Him who is the fountain of holiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the grounds on which justification and sanctification are
        inseparably connected, and the reasons why those who are dead to sin,
        or, as it is here expressed, justified from sin, can no longer live
        therein. From all this we see the necessity of retaining the Apostle’s
        expression in the verse before us, justified from sin. That it has been
        exchanged for the term freed in the English, as well as in most of the
        French versions, and that commentators are so generally undecided as to
        the proper rendering, arises from not clearly perceiving the ground on
        which the Apostle exclusively rests his denial of the consequence
        charged on his doctrine of justification, as leading to licentiousness.
        But on no other ground than that, as above explained, on which he has
        triumphantly vindicated it from this supposed pernicious consequence,
        can it be proved not to have such a tendency, and not to lead to such a
        result. On this ground his vindication must for ever stand unshaken. Had
        his answer to the question in the first verse ultimately rested,
        according to the reason given by Dr. Macknight, on the force of a motive
        presented to believers, however strong in itself, such as their having
        experienced the dreadful effects of sin in having died by it, or on the
        fallacious idea, according to Mr. Stuart, that they were insensible to
        its influence, how weak, as has been remarked, insufficient, and
        delusive, considering the state of human nature, would such reasons have
        been, on which to have rested his confident denial that they could
        continue to live in sin? But when the Apostle exhibits, as the cause of
        the believer’s not continuing in sin, his union with Christ, and the
        power of God in Christ Jesus, as he does in the preceding verses, he
        rests it on a foundation as stable as the throne of God. He had taught,
        in the foregoing part of the Epistle, that Jesus Christ is made to His
        people righteousness: he here teaches that He is also made to them
        sanctification. Throughout the whole of the discussion, it is material
        to keep in mind that they to whom, along with himself, the Apostle is
        referring, are those whom he had addressed (ch. 1:7) as ‘beloved of
        God,’ as ‘called,’ as ‘saints.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The same great truths are fully developed in the 29th and 30th verses of
        the eighth chapter, where it is shown that the persons who are conformed
        to the image of Christ were those who are justified, and who shall be
        glorified, the whole of which Paul there traces up to the sovereign
        appointment of God. There, in like manner, he shows that the people of
        God, being conformed to Christ in His death, are also conformed to Him
        in their walking in newness of life, as the prelude of their
        resurrection with Him to glory. To the same purpose he writes to the
        saints at Colosse, where he assures them that they are ‘complete in
        Christ, being buried with Him in baptism, wherein also they are risen
        with Him, through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him
        from the dead.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
        live with Him:
      </p>
      <p>
        Now — rather, since then — believers are one with Christ in His death,
        they have the certain prospect of for ever living with Him. That the
        life here mentioned is the life after the resurrection, as in verse 5th,
        appears from the phraseology. The Apostle speaks of it as a future life,
        which it is unnatural to interpret as signifying the believer’s
        spiritual life here, or as importing the continuation of it to the end
        of his course. There is no need of such straining, when the obvious
        meaning is true and most important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, the point is decided by the assertion, ‘we believe.’ It is a
        matter of faith, and not of present experience. ‘We believe.’ — Upon
        this it is useful to remark, that though the Apostle reasons and deduces
        from principles, yet we are to be cautious not to consider his doctrine
        as needing any other support but his own assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
        His statement, or expression of belief, is demonstration to a Christian.
        It was a truth believed by those whom he addressed, because taught by
        Paul and the other Apostles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no
        more, death hath no more dominion over Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing that. — The Apostle states the assumption that, as Christ,
        having been raised from the dead, will not die again, so neither will
        those die again who have died and risen with Him. This obviously refers
        to the resurrection life, and not to the present spiritual life. It is a
        fact of inconceivable consolation, that after the resurrection the
        believer will never again die. All the glory of heaven could not make us
        happy without this truth. Death hath no more dominion over Him. — This
        implies that death had once dominion over Christ Himself He was its
        lawful captive, as he took our place, and bore our sins. It is far from
        being true, according to Mr. Tholuck, that the word here used ‘seems to
        involve the idea of a usurped power, for properly, as Christ was an
        innocent being, there vas no reason why He should die.’ Christ was
        lawfully under the power of death for a time; and the word which
        signifies this applies to a lawful Lord as well as to a usurper. Jesus
        Christ being declared by His resurrection to be the Son of God with
        power, His people are engaged to put their trust in Him as the Creator
        and Ruler of the universe. In His resurrection they receive the
        assurance of the effect of His death, in satisfying Divine justice while
        making full atonement for their sins; and in His rising from the dead to
        an immortal life, as their Lord and Head, they have a certain pledge of
        their own resurrection to life and immortality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — For in that he died, He died unto sin once; but in that He
        liveth, He liveth unto God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that — or with respect to that — He died, Be died unto sin. — Here we
        have the same declaration concerning our Lord and Savior as in the 2nd
        verse concerning believers, of whom the Apostle says that they are dead
        to sin. Whatever, then, the expression signifies in the one case, it
        must also be understood to signify in the other. But those who attach a
        wrong interpretation to the phrase in the first occurrence, are
        necessitated to attribute to it a different one in the second.
        Accordingly Calvin remarks on this 10th verse, — ’The very form of
        expression, as applied to Christ, shows that He did not, like us, die to
        sin for the purpose of ceasing to commit it.’ Here are two
        misinterpretations, — first, of the 2nd verse, and next, as a natural
        consequence, of this 10th. A similar difference of interpretation will
        be found in the other commentators. Having mistaken the meaning of the
        one, they are compelled to vary it in the other. In the first, they
        introduce the idea of death to the power of sin, but in the last this is
        impossible. Our Lord never felt the power of sin, and therefore could
        not die to it. But He died to the guilt of sin — to the guilt of His
        people’s sins, which He had taken upon Him; and they, dying with Him, as
        is above declared, die to sin precisely in the same sense in which He
        died to it. This declaration, then, that Christ died to sin, explains in
        the clearest manner the meaning of the expression ‘dead to sin,’ verse
        2, proving that it signifies exclusively dying to the guilt of sin; for
        in no other sense could our Lord Jesus Christ die to sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of the death of believers to sin, the Apostle, after
        concluding his argument, shows to be, that sin shall not have dominion
        over them, verse 14, for they are not under the law but under grace. His
        argument is, that the doctrine of a free justification, which he had
        asserted in the fifth chapter, according to which believers are dead to,
        or justified from sin, by their oneness with Christ in His death, brings
        them into an entirely different state from that in which they formerly
        were in respect to their relation to God. Having been delivered from its
        guilt, — dead to it, or justified from it, verse 7, — they are in
        consequence delivered from its power. But to include the idea of power
        in the expression, ‘dead to sin,’ verse 2, entirely confuses and
        misrepresents his meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ suffered the penalty of sin, and ceased to bear it. Till
        His death He had sin upon Him; and therefore, though it was not
        committed by Him personally, yet it was His own, inasmuch as He had
        taken it upon Him. When He took it on Him, so as to free His people from
        its guilt, it became His own debt as truly as if it had been contracted
        by Him. When, therefore, He died on account of sin, He died to it, as He
        was now for ever justified from it. He was not justified from it till
        His resurrection; but from that moment He was dead to it. When He shall
        appear the second time, it will be ‘without sin,’ Hebrews 9:28. Once. —
        He died to sin once, and but once, because He fully atoned for it by His
        death. On this circumstance the Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
        lays much stress, and, in proving the excellence of His sacrifice beyond
        the legal sacrifices, often repeats it, Hebrews 9:12,26,28, 10:10, 12,
        14. He liveth unto God. — It need not excite any surprise that Christ is
        said henceforth to live unto God. The glory of God must be the great end
        of all life. Christ’s eternal life in human nature will, no doubt, more
        than all things else, be for the glory of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
        sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers are here commanded to reckon themselves to be really and
        effectually dead to sin — dead to its guilt — and alive unto God in
        Jesus Christ, as it ought to be rendered. The obligation thus enjoined
        follows from all that the Apostle had been inculcating respecting their
        blessed state as partakers with Christ, both in His death and in His
        life. As this is their real condition, he here commands them to maintain
        a full sense and conviction of it. The duties of the Christian life,
        flowing from their union with Jesus Christ and acceptance with God, he
        immediately proceeds to enforce. But here it is the obligation to
        maintain the conviction of their state that he exclusively presses upon
        them. To note this is of the greatest importance. Unless we keep in mind
        that we are dead to sin, and alive unto God in Jesus Christ our Lord, we
        cannot serve Him as we ought: we shall otherwise be serving in the
        oldness of the letter, and not in newness of spirit. But when the
        believer’s state of reconciliation with God, and his death to sin, from
        which he is delivered, is steadily kept in view, then he cultivates the
        spirit of adoption — then he strives to walk worthy of his calling, and,
        in the consideration of the mercies of God, presents his body a living
        sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, Romans 12:1; he rejoices in the
        Lord, and abounds in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost; he has
        peace in his conscience, his heart is enlarged, and he runs the way of
        God’s commandments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of their high privileges and state of acceptance with God, believers are
        ever reminded in Scripture; and it is not till a man has the answer of a
        good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 1 Peter
        3:21, and a sense of being justified from sin, having his conscience
        purged from dead works by the blood of Christ, that he can serve the
        living God, Hebrews 9:14. How important, then, is this admonition of the
        Apostle, Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, though
        often much obscured by false glosses turning it away from its true and
        appropriate meanings By many it would be accounted presumptuous in
        Christians to take it home to themselves. Hence they are not aware of
        the obligations they are under to labor to maintain the assurance of
        their union with Christ, and of their participation with Him in His
        death and resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we see that the Apostle, after he had fully developed the blessed
        state of believers, and declared the foundation on which it rests, with
        which their continuing to live in sin is incompatible, expressly enjoins
        this as a positive duty on those whom he addresses, and consequently on
        all Christians, thus reminding them that what he had said was not to be
        viewed in the light of abstract truth, but ought to be practically and
        individually brought home to their own bosoms. How seldom is this use
        made of the text before us! How seldom, if ever, is the duty it enforces
        urged upon Christians! How little is it considered as binding on their
        consciences! Yet, without attending to this duty, which, in connection
        with a right understanding of the Gospel, is consistent with the deepest
        humility, how can, they possibly bring forth those precious fruits of
        the Spirit which lie at the foundation of all the rest, love, and joy,
        and peace?
      </p>
      <p>How, in a word, can they walk with God?</p>
      <p>
        There was no part of the Exposition in which I felt so much difficulty
        as in the commencement of this chapter. In consulting a multitude of
        commentators, I found no satisfactory solution. Most of them explain the
        expression ‘dead to sin,’ in the 2nd verse, as importing death not only
        to the guilt, but also, as has been remarked, to the power of sin, — a
        proof that the assertion of the Apostle is misunderstood. But when it is
        perceived that the guilt of sin only is included, a clear light is
        thrown on this highly important part of the Epistle. This is the way in
        which it appears to have been viewed by Mr. Romaine, of which, till
        lately, I was not aware, and I do not recollect ever meeting with it in
        the works of any other writer. I subjoin the following interesting
        passage from his treatise On the Walk of Faith. ‘True spiritual
        mortification does not consist in sin not being in thee, nor in its
        being put upon the cross daily, nor yet in its being kept upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There must be something more to establish perfect peace in thy
        conscience; and that is the testimony of God concerning the body of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has provided for thy perfect deliverance from it in Christ.
        Everything needful for this purpose was finished by Him upon the cross.
        He was thy Surety. He suffered for thee. Thy sins were crucified with
        Him, and nailed to His cross. They were put to death when He died: for
        He was thy covenant-head, and thou wast legally represented by Him, and
        art indeed dead to sin by His dying to sin once. The law has now no more
        right to condemn thee, a believer, than it has to condemn Him. Justice
        is bound to deal with thee, as it has with thy risen and ascended
        Savior. If thou dost not thus see thy complete mortification in Him, sin
        will reign in thee. No sin can be crucified either in heart or life,
        unless it be first pardoned in conscience; because there will be want of
        faith to receive the strength of Jesus, by whom alone it can be
        crucified. If it be not mortified in its guilt, it cannot be subdued in
        its power. If the believer does not see his perfect deadness to sin in
        Jesus, he will open a wide door to unbelief; and if he be not persuaded
        of his completeness in Christ, he gives room for the attacks of
        self-righteous and legal tempers. If Christ be not all in all, self must
        still be looked upon as something great, and there will be food left for
        the pride of self-importance and self-sufficiency; so that he cannot
        grow into the death of Christ in sensible experience, further than he
        believes himself to be dead to sin in Christ. The more clearly and
        steadfastly he believes this, as the Apostle did — I am crucified with
        Christ — in proportion will he cleave to Christ, and receive from Him
        greater power to crucify sin. This believing view of his absolute
        mortification in Christ, is the true Gospel method of mortifying sin in
        our own persons. Read the sixth of the Romans, and pray for the Spirit
        of revelation to open it to thee. There thou wilt discover the true way
        to mortify sin. It is by believing that thou art planted together with
        Christ in His death; from thence only thy pardon flows, from thence thy
        daily victory is received, and from thence thy eternal victory will be
        perfected.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
        should obey it in the lusts thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having proved how unfounded is the objection that the doctrine of
        justification leads to the indulgence of sin, the Apostle now exhorts
        those whom he addresses to live agreeably to the holy nature and design
        of the Gospel. With this object he presents, throughout the rest of the
        chapter, various considerations adapted to induce them to walk in that
        newness of life to which they are risen with Christ. It should here be
        remarked, that although the apostle had expressly taught that they who
        are justified are likewise sanctified, yet as God is pleased to cause
        His people to act with Him in their sanctification — so that they shall
        both will and do, because He worketh in them to will and to do of His
        good pleasure — the earnest exhortations to obedience, and the motives
        held forth in the conclusion of the chapter, are entirely consistent
        with what had been declared as to the certainty of their sanctification
        resting on the power of God, and to be viewed as outward means which God
        employs to effect this purpose. Therefore. — The exhortation in this
        verse is founded on the preceding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, then, we have an example of the manner in which the Apostle urges
        believers to the performance of their duty to God. Because being united
        to Christ they were dead to sin, the conviction of which he had just
        before enjoined them to maintain, he exhorts them in this and the
        following verse to abstain from sin. Unless they possessed that
        conviction, the motive on which he here rests his exhortation would be
        inapplicable. This is his manner in all his Epistles, in common with the
        other Apostles, of enforcing the obligation of Christians to the
        performance of their duty. ‘Be ye kind one to another, forgiving one
        another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.’ He proceeds
        on the fact of their knowledge that their sins were forgiven.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to see what precise idea the Apostle intends to
        communicate by the addition of the epithet mortal; yet it is certain
        that he uses no unmeaning appendages, and that this word must add to the
        sense. The propriety of the epithet, as ascribed to the body, is
        evident; but still, why is this epithet added here? Paul had just
        charged believers to reckon themselves dead to sin, but alive to God.
        When, therefore, he here urges them not to allow sin to reign in their
        bodies, and designates their bodies as mortal, it may be that he means
        to intimate either that their struggle with sin, which will only
        continue while they are in the body, will be short, or to contrast the
        present state of the body with its future spiritual state. As in its
        future glorified state it is to live entirely to God, and to be without
        sin, so it follows that, even in its present mortal state, sin should
        not have it in subjection. Calvin is undoubtedly mistaken in saying that
        the word body here ‘is not taken in the sense of flesh, skin, and bones;
        but means, if I may be allowed the expression, the whole mass of the
        man; ‘that is, man as soul and body in its present earthly state. This
        would import that the soul is now mortal. Sin reign. — Sin is here
        personified and viewed as a king. Such a ruler is sin over all the
        world, except those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,1 John 5:19.
        This is the reason why men will spend their substance and their labor in
        the works of the flesh. Sin rules in them as a sovereign; and they of
        their own accord with eagerness pursue every ungodly course to which
        their corrupt nature impels them; and in the service of sin they will
        often ruin their health as well as their fortune. That ye should obey
        it, or, so as to obey it. — Sin is still a law in the members of
        believers, but it is not to be allowed to reign. It must be constantly
        resisted. Obey it in the lusts thereof: — That is, to obey sin in the
        lusts of the body. Sin is obeyed in gratifying the lusts or corrupt
        appetites of the body. The term lusts imports the inward corrupt
        inclination to sin from whence the acts of sin proceed, and of which the
        Apostle speaks particularly in the following chapter, where he shows
        that till after the commandment came to him in power, he had not known
        that corrupt inclination to be sin. Augustine here remarks that the
        Apostle does not say that in believers there is no sin, but that it
        should not reign, because while they live there must be sin in their
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
        unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God, as those that
        are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of
        righteousness unto God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither yield. — That is, do not present, afford, or make a donation of
        your members. Instruments — or weapons, or organs, to be employed in
        works of unrighteousness. Unto sin. — This surrender, against which the
        believer is cautioned, is to sin. They who employ the members of their
        bodies in doing the works of the flesh, present their bodies to sin as
        their sovereign. Members. — There is no occasion, with Dr. Macknight and
        others, to suppose that the word members here includes the faculties of
        the mind as well as the members of the body. It is of the body that the
        Apostle is speaking. It follows? indeed, as a consequence, that if sin
        is not to be practiced through the members of the body, neither is it to
        be indulged in the thoughts of the mind, for it is the latter that leads
        to the former. The word instruments evidently limits the expression to
        the members of the body. But yield yourselves unto God. — Yield
        yourselves soul and body. The exhortation, as it respected the service
        of sin, mentions only the members of the body which are the instruments
        of gratifying the corruptions of the mind. But this, as was observed,
        sufficiently implies that we are forbidden to employ the faculties of
        the soul in the service of sin, as well as the members of the body.
        There can be no doubt that all we are commanded to give to God, we are
        prohibited from giving to sin. If we are commanded to present ourselves
        unto God, then we are forbidden to present either the faculties of the
        mind or the members of the body to sin. The believer is to give himself
        up to God without any reservation. He is to employ both body and mind in
        every work required of him by God. He must decline no labor which the
        Lord sets before him, no trial to which He calls him, no cross which He
        lays upon him. He is not to count even his life dear if God demands its
        sacrifice. As those that are alive from the dead — Here again Christians
        are addressed as those who know their state. They are already in one
        sense raised from the dead. They have a spiritual life, of which they
        were by nature entirely destitute, and of which unbelievers are not only
        altogether destitute, but which they cannot even comprehend. Your
        members as instruments of righteousness. — The members of the body are
        not only to be used in the direct worship of God, and in doing those
        things in which their instrumentality is required, but in every action
        they ought to be employed in this manner, even in the common business of
        life, in which the glory of God should be constantly kept in view. The
        laborer who toils in the field, if he acts with an eye to the glory of
        God, ought to console himself with the consideration that when he has
        finished his day to man, he has wrought a day to God. This view of the
        matter is a great relief under his daily toils. Unto God. — That is,
        yield your members unto God.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the natural man presents his members to sin, so the believer is to
        present his members to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not
        under the law, but under grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        For sin shall not have dominion over you. — Such is the unqualified
        affirmation with which Paul in this place shuts up his triumphant reply
        to the objection to his doctrine urged in the first verse. No truth is
        more certain than that sin shall not have dominion over believers. God’s
        veracity and glory are pledged to prevent it. They are dead to the guilt
        of sin, and therefore its power shall no more predominate in them. They
        have put on the new man, and the warfare with the old man shall finally
        terminate in his destruction. The first for in this verse gives a reason
        why believers should exert themselves to give their members to the
        service of God. They shall not fail in their attempt, for sin shall not
        have dominion over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next for gives the reason why sin shall not have dominion over them.
        For ye are not under the law — literally, under law. — A great variety
        of interpretations are given of this declaration. But the meaning cannot
        be a matter of doubt to those who are well instructed in the nature of
        salvation by grace. It is quite obvious that the law which believers are
        here said not to be under, is the moral law, as a covenant of works, and
        not the legal dispensation, — to distinguish it from which may be the
        reason why the article is here omitted. To affirm that law here is the
        legal dispensation, is to say that all who lived under the law of Moses
        were under the dominion of sin. In the sense in which law is here
        understood, the Old Testament saints were not under it. They had the
        Gospel in figure. They trusted in the promised Savior, and sought not to
        justify themselves by their obedience to the law. Besides, all
        unbelievers, both Jews and Gentiles, are under the law, in the sense in
        which believers are here said not to be under it. Believers are not
        under the law as a covenant, because they have endured its curse and
        obeyed its precept in the person of their great Head, by whom the
        righteousness of the law has been fulfilled in them, ch. 8:4.
      </p>

        But every man, till he is united to Christ, is under the law, which
        condemns him. When united to Him, the believer is no longer under the
        law either to be condemned or to be justified. When Mr. Stuart says that
        it is from the law, ‘as inadequate to effect the sanctification and
        secure the obedience of sinners,’ that the Apostle here declares us to
        be free, he proves that he entirely misunderstands what is meant. The
        circumstance that the law cannot sanctify the sinner, and secure his
        obedience, confers no emancipation from its demands. The believer is
        free from the law, because another has taken his place, and fulfilled it
        in his stead. This implies that all who are under the law are also under
        the dominion of sin, and under the curse, Galatians 3:10. The
        self-righteous who trust in their works, and boast of their natural
        ability to serve God, are under the dominion of sin; and the very works
        in which they trust are sinful, or ‘dead works,’ Hebrews 9:14. They are
        such works as men perform before their consciences are purged by the
        blood of Christ. But under grace. — Believers are not under the covenant
        of works, but under the covenant of grace, by which they enjoy all the
        blessings of that gracious covenant in which all that is required of
        them is promised to them. They are in a state of reconciliation with
        God. They know the Lord.

        According to the tenor of that gracious covenant, His law is written in
        their hearts, and His fear is put within them. He has promised not to
        depart from them, and that they shall not depart from Him, Jeremiah.
        32:40; and their sins and iniquities, which separated them from God, are
        no more remembered by Him. Being made partakers of the favor of God
        through Jesus Christ, in whom grace was given them before the world
        began, 2 Timothy 1:9, they have every spiritual supply through Him who
        is full of grace. His grace is sufficient for them, 2 Corinthians 12:9.

      <p>
        The grace of God, which bringeth salvation, that hath appeared to all
        men, teacheth them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live
        soberly, righteously, and godly Titus 2:11. Not only is this grace
        manifested to them, but it operates within them. God works in them what
        is well pleasing in His sight, both to will and to do of His good
        pleasure. They who are under the law have nothing but their own strength
        in order to their obedience: sin, therefore, must have the dominion over
        them. But they who are under grace are by God Himself thoroughly
        furnished unto all good works: sin, therefore, shall not have dominion
        over them.

        The great principle of evangelical obedience is taught in this passage.

        Holiness is not the result of the law, but of the liberty wherewith
        Christ has made His people free. He sends forth the Spirit of grace into
        the hearts of all who belong to the election of grace, whom God hath
        from the beginning chosen to salvation through sanctification of the
        Spirit and belief of the truth; and the word of God worketh effectually
        in all who believe, 1 Thessalonians 2:13. Jesus Christ is the absolute
        master of the hearts of His people, of which He has taken possession,
        and in whom He reigns by the invincible power of the Spirit of grace.
        The new covenant made with Him, for those whom He has redeemed, and
        which is ratified with His blood, is immutable and irreversible.

        Here, again, it should be observed that the assurance thus given to
        believers, that sin shall not have dominion over them, could not be duly
        appreciated except on the ground that they knew that they were dead to
        sin and alive to God. Just in proportion as Christians are convinced of
        this, they will feel encouragement from this promise to persevere in
        their course. The assurance given to them that sin shall not have the
        dominion over them, is then very far from furnishing a pretext or
        inducement to a life of sin. On the contrary, they are thereby bound by
        every consideration of love and gratitude to serve God, while, by the
        certain prospect of final victory, they are encouraged to persevere, in
        spite of all difficulties and opposition, either from within or from
        without.
