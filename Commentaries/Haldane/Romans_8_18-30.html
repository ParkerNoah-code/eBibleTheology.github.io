      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
        worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had been reminding those to whom he wrote, that their
        sufferings with Christ is the way appointed by God to bring them to
        glory. Here he encourages them to endure affliction, because there is no
        comparison between their present sufferings and their future glory. In
        order to encourage the Israelites to sustain the difficulties that
        presented themselves to their entry into Canaan, God sent them of the
        fruits of the land while they were still in the desert. Our blessed
        Lord, too, permitted some of His disciples to witness His
        transfiguration, when His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was
        white as light. This was calculated to inspire them with an ardent
        desire to behold that heavenly glory, of which, on that occasion, they
        had a transient glimpse, and to render them more patient in sustaining
        the troubles they were about to encounter. In the same manner God acts
        towards His people when they suffer in this world. He sends them of the
        fruits of the heavenly Canaan, and allowing them to enjoy a measure of
        that peace which passeth all understanding, He favors them with some
        foretastes of the glory to be revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first testimony to the truth that the, Apostle is here declaring is
        his own. I reckon. — Paul was better qualified to judge in this matter
        than any other man, both as having endured the greatest sufferings, and
        as having been favored with a sight of the glory of heaven. His
        sufferings, Corinthians 4:9; 2 Corinthians 11:23, appear not to have
        been inferior to those that exercised the patience of Job, while his
        being caught up into the third heaven was peculiar to himself. But,
        independently of this, we have here the testimony of an inspired
        Apostle, which must be according to truth, as being immediately
        communicated by the Holy Ghost. Paul makes use of a word which refers to
        the casting up of an account, marking accurately the calculation, by
        comparing one thing with another, so as to arrive at the true result.
        The sufferings of the present time. — By this we are reminded that the
        present is a time of suffering, and that this world is to believers as a
        field of battle. The shortness, too, of the period of suffering is
        indicated. It is limited to the present life, respecting which man is
        compared to a flower which cometh forth and is cut down; to a shadow
        that fleeth and continueth not. ‘His days are swifter than a post; and
        as the flight of the eagle hastening after its prey.’ It is in the
        present time exclusively that sufferings are to be endured by the
        children of God. But if they promise to themselves the enjoyment of ease
        and carnal prosperity, they miscalculate the times, and confound the
        present with the future. They forget the many assurances of their
        Heavenly Father that this is not their rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        They overlook the example of those who by faith obtained a good report.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing
        rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
        pleasures of sin for a season. David, envying for a moment the
        prosperity of the wicked, having entered the sanctuary and considered
        their end, views it in a different light. ‘Nevertheless I am continually
        with Thee; Thou hast holden me by Thy right hand; Thou shalt guide me
        with Thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.’ ‘In Thy presence
        is fullness of joy; at Thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.’
        ‘Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their
        corn and their wine increased. I will both lay me down in peace and
        sleep, for Thou, Lord, only makest me to dwell in safety.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians often dwell upon their own sufferings, while they overlook
        the sufferings of their Lord, to whom they must be conformed. They
        forget their sins, on account of which they receive chastisement that
        they may not be condemned with the world, and for which they must also
        partake of their bitter fruits. But as there is no proportion between
        what is finite, however great it may be, and what is infinite, so their
        afflictions here, even were their lives prolonged to any period, and
        although they had no respite, would bear no proportion to their future
        glory either in intensity or duration The felicity of that glory is
        unspeakable, but their afflictions here are not insupportable. They are
        always accompanied with the compassion and the consolations of God. ‘As
        the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth
        by Christ.’ The patriarch Jacob, a fugitive from his father’s house,
        constrained to pass the night without a covering, with stones only for
        his pillow, enjoyed a vision excelling all with which he had been before
        favored. This is recorded to show that the believer, in his tribulation,
        often experiences more joy and peace than in his prosperity. ‘Thus saith
        the Lord God, although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and
        although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to
        them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.’ God
        never permits the sufferings of His people to be extreme. The glory that
        shall be revealed. — While the sufferings of believers here are only
        temporary, the glory which is to be revealed is eternal. Though yet
        concealed, it is already in existence, its discovery only is future. Now
        it is veiled from us in heaven, but ere long it shall be revealed. God
        is a source of ineffable light, joy, knowledge, power, and goodness. He
        is the sovereign good, and will communicate Himself to them that behold
        Him, in a way that is incomprehensible. In us. — The glory here spoken
        of is that to which the Apostle John refers, when he says that we shall
        see the Lord as He is, and that we shall be made like Him. If the rays
        of the sun illuminate the darkness on which they shine, what will be
        that light which the Sun of Righteousness will produce in the children
        of Him who is the Father of Lights! If the face of Moses shone, when,
        amidst the terrors of the law, he talked with God, what shall their
        condition be who shall behold Him, not on the mountain that might be
        touched, and that burned with fire, but in the heaven of heavens; not
        amidst thunderings and lightnings, but amidst the express testimonies of
        His favor and blessing They shall appear in the sanctuary of the Lord,
        and discern plainly the mysteries of the wisdom of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        They shall behold not the ark and the propitiatory, but the things in
        the heavens which these were made to represent. They shall see as they
        are seen, and know as they are known. To the enjoyment of this glory
        after the persecutions and troubles of this life, the Bridegroom is
        represented as calling His Church. ‘Lo, the winter is past, the rain is
        over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing
        of birds is come. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.’ As there
        is no proportion between finite and infinite, so no comparison can be
        made between the things that are seen and temporal, and the things that
        are unseen and eternal — between our light afflictions which are but for
        a moment, and that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory that
        shall be revealed in us. Such is the consolation which the Apostle here
        presents to the children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19-22. — For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for
        the manifestation of the sons of God (for the creature was made subject
        to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the
        same), in hope that the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
        bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
        For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
        together until now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 18th verse, the Apostle, for the comfort of believers, had
        declared that there is reserved for them a weight of glory to which
        their sufferings while in this world bear no comparison. To the same
        purpose he now refers to the existing state and future destination of
        the visible creation. In thus appealing to a double testimony — the one
        the voice of grace uttered by himself, the other the voice of universal
        nature, which speaks the same language — he encourages the children of
        God to endure with patience their present trials.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the verses before us, Paul, by an example of personification common
        in the Scriptures, which consists in attributing human affections to
        things inanimate or unintelligent, calls the attention of believers to
        the fact that the whole creation is in a state of suffering and
        degradation; and that, wearied with the vanity to which it has been
        reduced, it is earnestly looking for deliverance.
      </p>
      <p>
        That interpretation which, according to Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart,
        applies this expectation to mankind in general, is contrary to fact. Men
        in general are not looking for a glorious deliverance, nor is it a fact
        that they will obtain it; but it is a fact that there will be new
        heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. All that Mr.
        Stuart alleges against this is easily obviated. Most of it applies to
        passages that have been injudiciously appealed to on the subject, which
        do not bear the conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if the earth, after being burnt up, shall be restored in glory,
        there is a just foundation for the figurative expectation. In order to
        understand these verses, it is necessary to ascertain the import, — 1st
        , of the term creation, or creature; 2nd , of that of the vanity to
        which it is subjected; 3rd , of that deliverance which it shall
        experience. Creature. — The word in the original, which is translated in
        the 19th, 20th, and 21st verses, creature, and in the 22nd, creation,
        can have no reference to the fallen angels, for they do not desire the
        manifestation of the children of God; this they dread, and, looking
        forward to it, tremble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither can it refer to the elect angels, of whom it cannot be said that
        they shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, for to this they
        were never subjected. It does not apply to men, all of whom are either
        the children of God or of the wicked one. It cannot refer to the
        children of God, for they are here expressly distinguished from the
        creation of which the Apostle speaks; nor can it apply to wicked men,
        for they have no wish for the manifestation of the sons of God whom they
        hate, nor will they ever be delivered from the bondage of corruption,
        but cast into the lake of fire. It remains, then, that the creatures
        destitute of intelligence, animate and inanimate, the heavens and the
        earth, the elements, the plants and animals, are here referred to. The
        Apostle means to say that the creation, which, on account of sin, has,
        by the sentence of God, been subjected to vanity, shall be rescued from
        the present degradation under which it groans, and that, according to
        the hope held out to it, is longing to participate with the sons of God
        in that freedom from vanity into which it shall at length be introduced,
        partaking with them in their future and glorious deliverance from all
        evil. This indeed cannot mean that the plants and animals, as they at
        present exist, shall be restored; but that the condition of those things
        which shall belong to the new heavens and the new earth, prepared for
        the sons of God, shall be delivered from the curse, and restored to a
        perfect state, as when all things that God had created were pronounced
        by Him very good, and when, as at the beginning, before sin entered,
        they shall be fully adapted to the use of man.
      </p>
      <p>
        As men earnestly desire what is good, and, on the contrary, groan and
        sigh in their sufferings, the like emotions of joy and sorrow are here
        ascribed to the inanimate and unintelligent creation. In this way the
        prophets introduce the earth as groaning, and the animals as crying to
        God, in sympathy with the condition of man. ‘The land mourneth, for the
        corn is wasted; the new wine is dried up; the oil languisheth, because
        joy is withered away from the sons of men! How do the beasts groan! The
        beasts of the field cry also unto Thee!’ Joel 1:10-20. ‘How long shall
        the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness
        of them that dwell therein?’ Jeremiah 12:4. ‘The earth mourneth and
        fadeth away; the world languishes and fadeth away; the haughty people of
        the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled, under the inhabitants
        thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance,
        broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the
        earth. The new wine mourneth; the wine languisheth!’ Isaiah. 24:4-7. To
        the same purpose, Isaiah 13:13, 33:9, 34:4. On the other hand, the
        Prophet Isaiah, 49:13, predicting a better state of things, exclaims,
        ‘Sing, O heavens; and be joyful O earth; and break forth into singing, O
        mountains; for the Lord hath comforted His people, and will have mercy
        upon His afflicted!’ And in Psalm 98:4-6, ‘Make a joyful noise unto the
        Lord, all the earth; make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praises!
        Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof! Let the floods clap their
        hands: let the hills be joyful together!’ Thus, in the language of
        Scripture, the sins of men cause the creation to mourn; but the mercy of
        God, withdrawing His rebukes, causeth it to rejoice. Vanity. — What is
        called vanity in the 20th verse, is in the 21st denominated bondage of
        corruption. When the creation was brought into existence, God bestowed
        on it His blessing, and pronounced everything that He had made very
        good. Viewing that admirable palace which He had provided, He appointed
        man to reign in it, commanding all creation to be subject to him whom He
        had made in His own image. But when sin entered, then, in a certain
        sense, it may be said that all things had become evil, and were diverted
        from their proper end. The creatures by their nature were appointed for
        the service of the friends of their Creator; but since the entrance of
        sin they had become subservient to His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of the sun and the heavens being honored to give light to those
        who obey God, and the earth to support the righteous, they now minister
        to rebels. The sun shines upon the wicked, the earth nourishes those who
        blaspheme their Maker; while its various productions, instead of being
        employed for the glory of God, are used as instruments of ambition, of
        avarice, of intemperance, of cruelty, of idolatry, and are often
        employed for the destruction of His children. All these are subjected to
        vanity when applied by men for vain purposes. This degradation is a
        grievance to the works of God, which in themselves have remained in
        allegiance. They groan under it, but, keeping within their proper
        limits, hold on their course. Had it been the will of the Creator, after
        the entrance of sin, the creature might have refused to serve the vices,
        or even the necessities of man. This is sometimes threatened. In
        reproving the idolatry of the children of Israel, God speaks as if He
        intended to withdraw His creatures from their service, in taking them
        entirely away. ‘Therefore will I return and take away My corn in the
        time thereof, and My wine in the season thereof, and will recover My
        wool and My flax given to cover her nakedness,’ Hosea 2:9. And sometimes
        the creature is represented as reclaiming against the covetousness and
        wickedness of men. ‘The stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam
        out of the timber shall answer it,’ Habakkuk 2:11.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole creation, then, groaneth together, and is under bondage on
        account of the sin of man, and has suffered by it immensely. As to the
        inanimate creation, in many ways it shows its figurative groaning, and
        the vanity to which it has been reduced. ‘Cursed is the ground for thy
        sake; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee.’ It
        produces all noxious weeds, and in many places is entirely barren. It is
        subject to earthquakes, floods, and storms destructive to human life,
        and in various respects labors under the curse pronounced upon it. The
        lower animals have largely shared in the sufferings of man. They are
        made ‘to be taken and destroyed,’ Peter 2:12, and to devour one another.
        They have become subservient to the criminal pleasures of man, and are
        the victims of his oppressive cruelty. Some partake in the labors to
        which he is subjected; and all of them terminate their short existence
        by death, the effect of sin. All that belongs to the creation is fading
        and transitory, and death reigns universally. The heavens and the earth
        shall wax old like a garment. The earth once perished by water, and now
        it is reserved unto fire. ‘The heavens shall pass away with a great
        noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also and
        the works that are therein shall be burnt up. The heavens being on fire
        shall be dissolved.’ The cause of this subjection to vanity is not from
        their original tendencies, or from any fault in the creatures. They have
        been so subjected, not willingly, not owing to any natural defect or
        improper disposition in themselves, but by reason of the sin of man, and
        in order to his greater punishment. The houses of those who were guilty
        of rebellion were destroyed, Ezra 6:11; Daniel 2:5, not that there was
        guilt in the stones or the wood, but in order to inflict the severer
        punishment on their criminal possessors, and also to testify the greater
        abhorrence of their crime, in thus visiting them in the things that
        belonged to them. In the same manner, man, haring been constituted the
        Lord of the creatures, his punishment has been extended to them. This in
        a very striking manner demonstrates the hatred of God against sin. For
        as the leprosy not only defiled the man who was infected with it, but
        also the house he inhabited, in the same way, sin, which is the
        spiritual leprosy of man, has not only defiled our bodies and our souls,
        but, by the just judgment of God, has infected all creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In whatever way it may be attempted to be accounted for, it is a fact
        that the world and all around us is in a suffering and degraded
        condition. This state of things bears the appearance of being
        inconsistent with the government of God, all-powerful, wise, and good.
        The proud skeptic is here completely at a stand. He cannot even
        conjecture why such a state of things should have had place. With Mr.
        Hume, the language of every reflecting unbeliever must be, ‘The whole is
        a riddle, an enigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt, uncertainty,
        suspense of judgment, appear the only result of our most accurate
        scrutiny concerning this subject.’ The Book of God alone dispels the
        darkness, and unveils the mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, then, we learn how great is the evil of sin. It has polluted the
        heavens and the earth and has subjected the whole to vanity and
        corruption. Evil and misery prevail, and creation itself is compelled to
        witness the dishonor done to its Author. It would be derogatory to the
        glory of God to suppose that His works are now in the same condition in
        which they were at first formed, or that they will always continue as at
        present. In the meantime, all the creatures are groaning under their
        degradation, until the moment when God shall remove those obstacles
        which prevent them from answering their proper ends, and render them
        incapable of suitably glorifying Him. But the righteous Judge, who
        subjected them to vanity in consequence of the disobedience of man; has
        made provision for their final restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creation, then, is not in that state in which it was originally
        constituted. A fearful change and disorganization, even in the frame of
        the natural world, has taken place. The introduction of sin has brought
        along with it this subjection to vanity and the bondage of corruption,
        and all that ruin under which nature groans. How miserable is the
        condition of those who have their portion in this world! Of them it may
        be truly said, ‘Surely they have inherited lies, vanity, and things
        wherein there is no profit.’ Of those ‘who mind earthly things,’ it is
        written, their ‘end is destruction.’ ‘The heavens and the earth which
        are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against
        the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.’ Delivered. — Some
        suppose that the word delivered signifies an entire annihilation, and in
        support of this opinion allege such passages as Peter 3:10; Revelation
        20:11. But as a tendency of all things in nature is to their own
        preservation, how could the creation be represented as earnestly
        expecting the manifestation of the sons of God, if that manifestation
        were to be accompanied with its final ruin and destruction?
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, the Apostle promises not merely a future deliverance, but also
        a glorious future existence. The Scriptures, too, in various places,
        predict the continued subsistence of the heavens and the earth, as 2
        Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:1. Respecting the passages quoted above, as
        importing their annihilation, it ought to be observed that the
        destruction off the substance of things differs from a change in their
        qualities. When metal of a certain shape is subjected to fire, it is
        destroyed as to its figure, but not as to its substance. Thus the
        heavens and the earth will pass through the fire, but only that they may
        be purified and come forth anew, more excellent than before. In <19A226>
        Psalm 102:26, it is said, ‘They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure;
        yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shall Thou
        change them, and they shall be changed. ’ That the Apostle Peter, when
        he says that the heavens shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt
        with fervent heat, does not refer to the destruction of their substance,
        but to their purification, is evident from what he immediately adds, —
        ’Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a
        new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness;’ A little before he had said,
        ‘The world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished,’
        although its substance remains as at the beginning. If, then, the
        punishment of sin has extended to the creatures, in bringing them under
        the bondage of corruption, so, according to the passage before us, that
        grace which reigns above sin, will also be extended to their
        deliverance. And, as the punishment of the sins of men is so much the
        greater as their effects extend to the creatures, in like manner so much
        the greater will be the glory that shall be revealed in them, that the
        creatures which were formed for their use shall be made to participate
        with them in the day of the restitution of all things. Through the
        goodness of God they shall follow the deliverance and final destination
        of the children of God, and not that of His enemies.

        When God created the world, He ‘saw everything that He had made, and,
        behold, it was very good.’ When man transgressed, God viewed it a second
        time, and said, ‘Cursed is the ground for thy sake.’ When the promise
        that the Deliverer should come into the world to re-establish peace
        between God and man was given, the effect of this blessed reconciliation
        was to extend even to the inanimate and unintelligent creation; and God,
        it may be said, then viewed His work a third time, and held out the hope
        of a glorious restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creature, then, has been subjected to the indignity which it now
        suffers, in hope that it will one day be delivered from the bondage of
        corruption, and partake of the glorious freedom of the children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hope was held out in the sentence pronounced on man, for, in the
        doom of our first parents, the Divine purpose of providing a deliverer
        was revealed. We know not the circumstances of this change, how it will
        be effected, or in what form the creation — those new heavens and that
        new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness, suited for the abode of the
        sons of God — shall then exist; but we are sure that it shall be worthy
        of the Divine wisdom, although at present beyond our comprehension.
        Manifestation of the sons of God. — Believers are even now The sons of
        God, but the world knows them not, 1 John 3:1. In this respect they are
        not seen. Their bodies, as well as their spirits, have been purchased by
        Christ, and they are become His members. Their bodies have, however, no
        marks of this Divine relation, but, like those of other men, are subject
        to disease, to death, and corruption. And although they have been
        regenerated by the Spirit of God, there is still a law in their members
        warring against the law of their mind. But the period approaches when
        their souls shall be freed from every remainder of corruption, and their
        bodies shall be made like unto the glorious body of the Son of God. Then
        this corruptible shall put on in corruption, and then shall they shine
        forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. It is then that they
        shall be manifested in their true character, illustrious as the sons of
        God, seated upon thrones, and conspicuous in robes of light and glory.

        Ver. 23. — And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first
        fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
        for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the four preceding verses, the Apostle had appealed to the state of
        nature, which, by a striking and beautiful figure, is personified and
        represented as groaning under the oppression of suffering, through the
        entrance of sin, and looking forward with ardent expectation, as with
        outstretched neck, to a future and better dispensation. He now proceeds
        to call the attention of believers to their own feelings and experience,
        meaning to say that if the unintelligent creation is longing for the
        manifestation of the sons of God, how much more earnestly must they
        themselves long for that glorious event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians who have received the foretastes of everlasting- felicity,
        sympathize with the groans of nature. They enjoy, indeed, even at
        present, a blessed freedom. They are delivered from the guilt and
        dominion of sin, the curse of the law, and a servile spirit in their
        obedience to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, however, they have much to suffer while in the world; but they
        wait for the redemption of their bodies, and the full manifestation of
        their character as the children of God. Their bodies, as well as their
        spirits, have been given to Christ. They are equally the fruit of His
        purchase, and are become His members. But it is not till His people
        shall have arisen from the grave that they will enjoy all the privileges
        consequent on His redemption. The first fruits of the Spirit. — These
        are love and joy in the Holy Ghost, peace of conscience, and communion
        with God. They are the graces of the Spirit conferred on believers,
        called first fruits, because, as the first fruits of the fields were
        offered to God under the law, so these graces redound to God’s glory.
        And as the first ears of corn were a pledge of an abundant harvest, so
        these graces are a pledge to believers of their complete felicity,
        because they are given to them Of God for the confirmation of their
        hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are a pledge, because the same love and grace that moved their
        Heavenly Father to impart these beginnings of their salvation will move
        Him to perfect the good work. These first fruits, then, are the
        foretastes of heaven, or the earnest of the inheritance. This is the
        most invaluable privilege of the children of God in the present life. It
        is a joy the world cannot give and cannot take away. The error which
        would represent these privileges as peculiar to the Apostles and the
        first Christians, and restrict the fruits of the Spirit to miraculous
        gifts, ought not for one moment to be admitted. The Apostle is speaking
        of all the children of God to the end of the world, without excepting
        even the weakeSt. As the first fruits of the harvest were consecrated to
        God, so we should be careful not to abuse the gifts of the Spirit of God
        in us. As the first fruits were to be carried to the house of God, so,
        as God has communicated to us His grace, we should also go to His house
        making a public profession of His name. The children of Israel, in
        offering the first fruits, were commanded to confess their miserable
        original state, and to recount their experience of the goodness of God,
        Deuteronomy 26:5. In the same way we should consider the graces of the
        Holy Spirit in us as the first fruits of the heavenly Canaan which God
        hath given us, and confess that we were by nature children of wrath,
        dead in trespasses and sins, and that the Lord, having had compassion on
        us, has delivered us from the servitude of sin, and the power of
        darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son. Groan
        within ourselves. — Not only they — the whole creation or every creature
        — but also believers themselves, will all their advantages, groan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even they find it difficult to bear up under the pressure which in their
        present state weighs them down, while carrying about with them a body of
        sin and death. Of this groaning the Apostle, as we have seen, ch. 7:24,
        presents himself as an example, — ’O wretched man that I am;’ and again
        when he says, ‘We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened,’
        2 Corinthians 5:4. In the same manner David groaned, when he complained
        that his iniquities were a burden too heavy for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers groan on account of indwelling sin, of the temptations of
        Satan and the world, and of the evils that afflict their bodies and
        souls. They feel that something is always wanting to them in this world.
        There is nothing but that sovereign good, which can only be found in
        God, fully able to satisfy their desires. Believers groan within
        themselves. Their groanings are not such as those of hypocrites, which
        are only outward; they are from within. They do not always meet the ear
        of man, but they reach the throne of God. ‘All my desire,’ says David,
        ‘is before Thee, and my groaning is not hid from Thee,’ Psalm 38:9.
        These groanings are sighs and prayers to God, which are spoken of in the
        26th verse of this chapter, where we learn their efficient cause, which
        is not flesh and blood. They are fruits of the Spirit, so that by them
        believes observe in themselves the spirit of regeneration. Waiting for
        the adoption. — Believers have already been adopted into the family of
        God, and are His children; but they have not yet been openly declared to
        be so, nor made in all respects suitable to this character. If they are
        the sons of God, they must be made glorious, both in soul and body; but
        till they arrive in heaven, their adoption will not be fully manifested.
        Adoption may be viewed at three periods. It may be considered in the
        election of His people, when God decrees their adoption before they are
        called or united to Jesus Christ; yet they are even then denominated the
        children of God. In the eleventh chapter of John, where Caiaphas,
        prophesying of the death of Jesus, says that he should die, not for that
        nation only, but for all the children of God that were scattered abroad.
        Under the term children of God were comprehended those who had not yet
        been called, Acts 18:10. In their calling and regeneration they are
        adopted into God’s family, being then united to Christ; but as their
        bodies do not partake in that regeneration, and are not yet conformed to
        the glorious body of Jesus Christ, they still wait for the entire
        accomplishment of their adoption, when, at the resurrection, they shall
        enter on the full possession of the inheritance. Accordingly Jesus
        denominates that blessed resurrection ‘the regeneration,’ because then
        not only the souls of believers, but also their bodies, shall bear the
        heavenly image of the second Adam. Then they shall enter fully into the
        possession of their inheritance; for in that day Jesus Christ will say
        to His elect ‘Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
        prepared for you from the foundation of the world.’ Heaven, into which
        they will then enter, is an inheritance suitable to the dignity of the
        sons of God, and for this they are waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The children of God wait for the accomplishment of all that their
        adoption imports. They wait for it as Jacob did. ‘I have waited for Thy
        salvation, O Lord!’ Genesis 49:18. They wait as the believers at Corinth
        were waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Corinthians 1:7;
        and as all believers who through the Spirit wait for the hope of
        righteousness by faith, Galatians 5:5. ‘Looking for the blessed hope,
        and the glorious appearing of the great God, even our Savior Jesus
        Christ,’ Titus 2:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as the Thessalonians, who, having been turned from idols to serve
        the living and true God, waited for His Son from heaven, 1 Thessalonians
        1:10; also as is recorded in Hebrews 9:28; James 5:7,8; 2 Peter 3:12. In
        this manner Paul waited for his crown, 2 Timothy 4:8. It was this
        waiting for, or expectation of, deliverance from the Lord, that
        encouraged Noah to build the ark, and Abraham to leave his country, and
        Moses to esteem the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
        in Egypt, and the elders who obtained a good report through faith, to
        seek a better, that is, an heavenly country. It was the expectation of
        eternal life that sustained those who shed their blood for the testimony
        of Jesus. The redemption of our body. — That there might be no mistake
        respecting the meaning of the adoption in this unusual application, the
        Apostle himself subjoins an explanation — even the redemption of our
        body, because the body will then be delivered from the grave, as a
        prisoner when redeemed is delivered from his prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why, it may be asked, does the Apostle here employ the term
        redemption rather than that of resurrection, which is so common in the
        New Testament? To this it may be replied, that the Holy Scriptures often
        make use of this expression to represent a great deliverance, as in
        <19A702> Psalm 107:2: ‘Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath
        redeemed from the hand of the enemy’ And as in Isaiah 63, where those
        are spoken of who are redeemed of the Lord from the hand of the enemy.
        It is evident that Paul employs this expression forcibly to designate
        the greatest of all deliverances, the highest object of our desires,
        which is to be the subject of our eternal gratitude. When this term is
        so used, it commonly denotes two things, — the one, that the deliverance
        spoken of is effected in a manner glorious and conspicuous, exhibiting
        the greatest effort of power; the other, that it is a complete
        deliverance, placing us beyond all danger. On this ground, then, it is
        evident that no work is better entitled to the appellation of redemption
        than that of the re-establishment of our bodies, which will be an
        illustrious effect of the infinite power of God. It is the work of the
        Lord of nature — of Him who holds in His hands the keys of life and
        death. His light alone can dispel the darkness of the tomb. It is only
        His hand that can break its seal and its silence. On this account the
        Apostle appeals, with an accumulation of terms, to the exceeding
        greatness of the power of God to upward who believe, according to the
        working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised
        Him from the dead, Ephesians 1:19,20.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last deliverance will be so perfect, that nothing can be more
        complete, since ‘the children of the resurrection’ shall be restored not
        to their first life, but to a state which will be one of surpassing
        glory and never-ending immortality. Death will be swallowed up in
        victory. Earthly warriors may obtain two sorts of victories over their
        enemies. One may be called a temporary or partial victory, which causes
        the enemy to fly, which deprives him of part of his force, but does not
        prevent him from re-establishing himself; returning to the field of
        battle, and placing the conqueror in the hazard of losing what he has
        gained. The other may be termed a complete and decisive victory, which
        so effectually subdues the hostile power, that it can never regain what
        it has lost. There are also two sorts of resurrections, one like that of
        Lazarus, in which death was overcome but not destroyed, since Lazarus
        died a second time; the other is, that of believers at the last day,
        when death will not only be overcome, but cast out and for ever
        exterminated. Both of these may be properly called a resurrection; but
        to speak with greater force, the second is here called a redemption.
        Besides, the Apostle, in employing this term, has reference to the
        redemption which Jesus Christ has effected at the infinite price of His
        blood. It is true this price was fully paid on the day of His death; yet
        two things are certain: the one is, that our resurrection will only take
        place in virtue of the value and imperishable efficacy of that blood,
        which has acquired for us life and happiness; the other, that the
        redemption accomplished on the cross and the resurrection are not two
        different works. They are hut one work, viewed under different aspects,
        and at different periods; the redemption on the cross being our
        redemption by price, and the resurrection our redemption by power — a
        perfect and undivided salvation begun and terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day, then, of the redemption of our bodies will be the day of the
        entire accomplishment of our adoption, as then only we shall enter on
        the complete possession of the children of God. In Jesus Christ our
        redemption was fully accomplished when He said on the cross, ‘It is
        finished.’ In us it is accomplished by different degrees. The first
        degree is in this life; the second, at death; the third, at the
        resurrection. In this life, the degree of redemption which we obtain is
        the remission of our sins, our sanctification, and freedom from the law
        and the slavery of sin. At death, our souls are delivered from all sin,
        and their sanctification is complete; for the soul, at its departure
        from the body, is received into the heavenly sanctuary, into which
        nothing can enter that defileth; and as to the body, death prepares it
        for in corruption and immortality, for that which we sow is not
        quickened except it die. It must therefore return to dust, there to
        leave its corruption, its weakness, its dishonor. Hence it follows that
        believers should not fear death, since death obtains for them the second
        degree of their redemption. But as our bodies remain in the dust till
        the day of our blessed resurrection, that day is called the day of the
        redemption of our body, as being the last and highest degree of our
        redemption. Then the body being reunited to the soul, death will be
        swallowed up in victory; for the last enemy that shall be destroyed is
        death, for till then death will reign over our bodies. But then the
        children of God shall sing that triumphant song, ‘O death, where is thy
        sting? O grave, where is thy victory?’ ‘I will ransom them from the
        power of the grave; I will redeem them from death; O death, I will be
        thy plague; O grave, I will be thy destruction.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The elevation of His people to glory on the day of their redemption,
        will be the last act in the economy of Jesus Christ as Mediator. He will
        then terminate His reign and the whole work of their salvation. For then
        He will present the whole Church to the Father, saying, ‘Behold I and
        the children whom Thou hast given Me.’ Then He will deliver up the
        kingdom, having nothing further to do in the work of redemption. This
        will be the rendering of the account by the Son to the Father of the
        charge committed to Him; and for this reason the Apostle says, ‘When all
        things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be
        subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in
        all;’ because, as His economy commenced by an act of submission of the
        Son to the Father, when in entering into the world He said, ‘Lo, I come
        to do Thy will, O God,’ it will also terminate by a similar act, as the
        Son will then deliver up the kingdom to Him from whom He received it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers are here said to have received the first fruits of the Spirit,
        and to be waiting for the redemption of their bodies. In the fourth
        chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, the Apostle says, ‘Grieve not
        the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
        redemption.’ As this last passage has so much similarity to the one
        before us, and as they are calculated to throw light on each other, it
        may be proper in this place to consider its meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sealing of believers implies that God has marked them by His Spirit
        to distinguish them from the rest of mankind. Marking His people in this
        manner as His peculiar property, imports that He loves them as His own;
        that they are His ‘jewels,’ or peculiar treasure, Malachi 3:17. But the
        Apostle does not say that believers have been merely marked, but that
        they have been sealed, which implies much more; for although every seal
        is a mark, every mark is not a seal. Seals are marks which bear the arms
        of those to whom they belong, and often their image or resemblance, as
        the seals of princes. Thus the principal effect of the Holy Spirit is to
        impress on the hearts of His people the image of the Son of God. As the
        matter to which the seal is applied contributes nothing to the formation
        of the character it receives, and only yields to the impression made on
        it, so the heart is not active, but passive, under the application of
        this Divine seal, by which we receive the image of God, the characters
        of which are traced by the Holy Spirit, and depend for their formation
        entirely on His efficiency. As seals confirm the covenants or promises
        to which they are affixed, in the same manner this heavenly signet
        firmly establishes the declaration of the Divine mercy, and makes it
        irreversible. It confirms to our faith the mysteries of the Gospel, and
        renders certain to our hope the promises of the covenant. The seal of
        man, although it alters the form, makes no change on the substance of
        the matter to which it is applied, and possesses no virtue to render it
        proper for receiving the impression. But the seal of God changes the
        matter on which it is impressed, and although naturally hard, renders it
        impressible, converting a heart of stone into a heart of flesh. The seal
        of man is speedily withdrawn from the matter it impresses, and the
        impression gradually becomes faint, till it is at length effaced. But
        the seal of the Holy Spirit remains in the heart, so that the image it
        forms can never be obliterated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle not only affirms that we are sealed by the Holy Spirit of
        God, but says that we are sealed unto the day of redemption; that is,
        this seal is given us in respect of our blessed resurrection; as the
        pledge of our complete transformation into the likeness of Christ. This
        Divine seal is that by which the Lord our great Judge will distinguish
        the righteous from the wicked, raising the one to the resurrection of
        life, and the other to the resurrection of damnation. It is also the
        Holy Spirit which forms in us the hope of that future redemption, our
        souls having no good desire whatever of which He is not the author.
        These things are certain; but it does not appear to be the principal
        design of the Apostle to enforce them here. It seems rather to be to
        teach that the Holy Spirit is to us a seal or assured pledge of the
        reality of our resurrection, or, as is said, ‘the earnest of our
        inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.’ Besides
        this, the Holy Spirit confirms in our souls everything on which the hope
        of our resurrection depends.
      </p>
      <p>
        That hope depends on the belief that Jesus Christ has died for our sins,
        of which the Holy Spirit bears record in our hearts by giving us the
        answer of a God conscience. It depends on knowing that Jesus Christ has
        in dying overcome death, and has gloriously risen again to restore to us
        life which we had forfeited. This is a truth which the Holy Spirit
        certifies to us, since He is the Spirit of Christ given in virtue of His
        resurrection. It depends on knowing that Jesus Christ is in heaven,
        reigning at the right hand of the Father, and that all power is given
        unto Him, that He may give eternal life to all His people. The Holy
        Spirit testifies to us this glory since His coming is its fruit and
        effect. ‘The Holy Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not
        yet glorified;’ and the Savior Himself says that He will send the
        Comforter, ‘even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,’
        concerning which the Apostle Peter declares, ‘Being by the right hand of
        God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy
        Ghost, He hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear.’ As if he had
        said that this marvelous effusion of the Holy Spirit is an effect, and
        consequently an assured proof, of the heavenly glory of Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since God gives His Holy Spirit to His children to seal them to the day
        of redemption, it is evident that His care of them must extend to the
        blessed consummation to which He purposes to conduct them. He will not
        withdraw His gracious hand from them, but will bring them to the
        possession and enjoyment of His glory. ‘The Lord will perfect that which
        concerneth me.’ ‘Being confident of this very thing, that He which hath
        begun a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be remarked that the Apostle says ‘unto the day of redemption,’
        and not simply, to the redemption. This expression, the day of
        redemption’s leads us to consider the advantage that grace has over
        nature, and the future world over that which we now inhabit. When God
        created the universe, He made light and darkness, day and night; and our
        time consists of their alternate successions. But it will not be so in
        the second creation, for ‘there shall be no night there.’ It will be one
        perpetual day of life without death, of holiness without sin, and of joy
        without grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day here referred to may be viewed in contrast with two other solemn
        days, both of which are celebrated in the Scriptures. One is the day of
        Sinai, the other of Pentecost: this is the day of redemption. In the
        economy of the Father, the first was a day of public and extraordinary
        grandeur, appointed to display in the most remarkable manner His glory,
        when God descended with awful majesty amidst blackness, and darkness,
        and tempest: In the economy of the Holy Ghost, the second was the day
        when He came as a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, when
        the Apostles were assembled, and, under the symbol of cloven tongues of
        fire, rested upon them. In the economy of the Son, there will also be a
        day of public magnificence, and that will be the day of judgment, when,
        seated on the throne of His glory, Jesus Christ will come with His
        mighty angels to judge the quick and the dead. Then calling His elect
        from the four winds, with the voice of the archangel, He will raise them
        from the dust, and elevate them to the glory of His kingdom. The first
        of these days was the day of the publication of the law; the second was
        the day of the publication of grace; and the third will be the day of
        the publication of glory. This will be the day of the complete
        redemption of the children of God, unto which they have been sealed, and
        of their manifestation in their proper character. It will be the day
        when their bodies shall come forth from the grave, made like unto the
        glorious body of the Son of God, by the sovereign efficacy of the
        application of His blood, and by His infinite power. Then shall the
        righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Then
        they shall inherit the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth
        righteousness, which they now expect according to the promise, for God
        will make all things new. Then they shall be with Jesus where He is and
        shall behold His glory which God hath given Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let those rejoice who are waiting for the Divine Redeemer. Their bodies
        indeed must be dissolved, and it doth not yet appear what they shall be.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at that great day they shall be raised up incorruptible, they shall
        be rendered immortal, and shall dwell in heavenly mansions. And that
        they may not doubt this, God has already marked them with His Divine
        seal They have been sealed by the Holy Spirit of God unto the day of the
        redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope;
        for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
      </p>
      <p>
        For we are saved by hope. — According to the original, this phrase may
        either be translated by hope, or in hope; but from the connection it
        appears that it ought to be translated, as in the French versions, in
        hope .
      </p>
      <p>
        The word salvation, or saved, signifies all the benefits of our
        redemption, — namely, remission of sins, sanctification, and
        glorification. ‘The Son of Man is come to save that which was lost.’ In
        this sense Jesus Christ is called the Savior, because it is by Him that
        we are justified and sanctified, and glorified. This word has in
        Scripture sometimes a more limited, and sometimes a more extended,
        meaning. In particular places salvation is spoken of as already
        possessed, as where it is said, God has ‘saved us by the washing of
        regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.’ Generally it signifies
        all the benefits of our redemption, when fully possessed by our final
        admission to glory, as when it is said, ‘He that endureth to the end
        shall be saved.’ In this verse it is regarded as enjoyed only in hope, —
        that is to say, in expectancy, since we have not yet been put in
        possession of the glory of the kingdom of heaven, In order to
        distinguish the measure of salvation which believers have in possession,
        and what they have of it in hope, we must consider its gradations. The
        first of these is their eternal election, of which the Apostle speaks,
        Ephesians 1:3,4, according to which their names were written in heaven
        before the creation of the world. The second gradation is their
        effectual calling, by which God has called them from darkness into the
        kingdom of His beloved Son, so that their souls are already partakers of
        grace, and their bodies habitations of God through the Spirit, and
        members of Jesus Christ. Of these gradations of their salvation they are
        already in possession. But the third gradation, in which sin shall be
        entirely eradicated from their souls, and their bodies shall be made
        like to the glorious body of the Lord Jesus Christ, is as yet enjoyed by
        them only in hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term hope is used in two different senses, — the one proper, and the
        other figurative. Properly, it means the mixture of expectation and
        desire of that to which we look forward, so that we are kept students to
        one object, as where it is said, ‘Hope is the anchor of the soul.’
        Figuratively, it signifies that which we hope for, as when God is called
        our hope — ’Thou art my hope, O Lord God,’ Psalm 71:5; or, ‘Jesus
        Christ, which is our hope,’ 1 Timothy 1:1; and as when it is said, we
        give thanks to God ‘for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,’
        Colossians 1:5. The word hope, then, either denotes as in the verse
        before us, the grace of hope, in reference to the person hoping, or the
        object of hope, in reference to the thing hoped for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope is so closely allied to faith, that sometimes in Scripture it is
        taken for faith itself. They are, however, distinct the one from the
        other. By faith we believe the promises made to us by God; by hope we
        expect to receive the good things which God has promised; so that faith
        hath properly for its object the promise, and hope for its object the
        thing promised, and the execution of the promise. Faith regards its
        object as present, but hope regards it as future. Faith precedes hope,
        and is its foundation. We hope for life eternal, because we believe the
        promises which God has made respecting it; and if we believe these
        promises, we must expect their effect. Hope looks to eternal life as
        that which is future in regard to its remoteness; but in regard to its
        certainty, faith looks to it as a thing that is present. ‘Hope,’ says
        the Apostle, ‘maketh not ashamed;’ and he declares that ‘we rejoice in
        hope of the glory of God.’ Thus he ascribes to it the same certainty as
        to faith; and in the Epistle to the Hebrews he speaks of ‘the full
        assurance of hope.’ Faith and hope are virtues of this like, which will
        have no place in the life that is to come. ‘Now abideth faith, hope, and
        love.’ Faith and hope will cease; and in this respect love is the
        greatest, as love will abide for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objects of the believer’s hope are spiritual and heavenly blessings.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are different from earthly blessings. The men of the world hope for
        riches and the perishable things of this life; the believer hopes for an
        inheritance in heaven, that fadeth not away. For this hope Moses gave up
        the riches and treasures of Egypt. By this hope David distinguishes
        himself from the ungodly. ‘Deliver me from men of the world, which have
        their portion in this life, and whose belly Thou fullest with Thy hid
        treasure; they are full of children, and leave the rest of their
        substance to their babes. As for me, I will behold Thy face in
        righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with Thy likeness,’
        Psalm 17:13-15. And, contrasting his condition with that of the children
        of this world, he says, Psalm 73:7, ‘Their eyes stand out with fatness:
        they have more than heart could wish;’ but as to himself, he had been
        plagued all the day long, and chastened every morning; yet he adds,
        ‘Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou hast holden me by my
        right hand. Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive
        me to glory.’ If it should be said by believers, May not we also hope
        for perishable and temporal blessings? the answer is, that Christian
        hope is founded on the promises of God, and on them it is rested. The
        hope which exceeds these promises is carnal and worldly. To know,
        therefore, what is the object of Christian hope, we must observe what
        are the promises of God. It is true that godliness has the promise of
        the life that now is, and of that which is to come; but respecting this
        life God’s promises are conditional, and to be fulfilled only as He sees
        their accomplishment to be subservient to His glory and our good; while
        as to the life that is to come, they are absolute. Are we, then, to
        expect only ease and happiness in this world, to whom it has been
        declared that ‘we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom
        of God;’ and to whom the Lord Himself says, ‘If any man will come after
        Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me?’ The
        people of God should therefore rest their hope on the absolute promises
        of God, which cannot fail, of blessings that are unperishable, and of a
        real and permanent felicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundations and support of Christian hope are firm and certain.
        First, the word and immutable promise of God; for heaven and earth shall
        pass away, but His word shall remain for ever. God has promised heaven
        as the eternal inheritance of His people. Shall they doubt His fidelity?
        He has said, ‘The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
        My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My
        peace be removed,’ Isaiah 54:10. He has accompanied His promise with His
        oath. ‘Willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the
        immutability of His counsel; that by two immutable things, in which it
        was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who
        have ‘died for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,’ Hebrews
        6:17. We have, besides, the blood of the Son of God, with which His
        promise has been sealed; and His obedience even unto death, which He has
        rendered to His Father, for the foundation of this hope. We have also
        the intercession of our great High Priest, of whom the Apostle, in
        establishing the grounds of the assurance of faith and hope, says not
        only that He is dead, but that He is risen, and at the right hand of
        God; who also maketh intercession for us. He declares, too, that our
        hope enters into heaven, where Jesus our forerunner has entered for us.
        To these foundations of our hope may be added, that it is said, ‘Ye were
        sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our
        inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession.’ The
        Apostle calls this hope an anchor of the soul, — representing the
        believer, in the temptations and assaults to which he is exposed, under
        the similitude of a ship tossed by the sea, but which has an anchor
        fixed in the ground, firm and steadfast, which prevents its being driven
        away by the waves. This hope is not only necessary in adversity, but
        also in prosperity, in raising our affections to things above, and
        disengaging them from the world. The good hope through grace
        tranquilizes the soul. ‘Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art
        thou disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise Him, who
        is the health of my countenance, and my God,’ Psalm 43:5. This hope
        consoles us in life and in death. It softens the bitterness of
        affliction, supports the soul in adversity, and in prosperity raises the
        affections to heavenly objects. It promotes our sanctification; for he
        who hath this hope of beholding Jesus as He is, purifieth himself even
        as He is pure, 1 John 3:3. It assures us that, if Jesus died and rose
        again, them all who sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. Let
        believers renounce their vain hopes of happiness in this world. Here
        they are strangers and pilgrims, and absent from the Lord. Let them hope
        for His presence, and communion with Him in glory. ‘Now,’ says the
        Apostle, ‘the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
        that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian hope is a virtue produced by the Holy Spirit, in which,
        through His power, we should abound, and by which, resting on the
        promises of God in Jesus Christ, we expect our complete salvation. This
        hope is a part of our spiritual armor against principalities and powers,
        and spiritual! wickedness, with which we have to wrestle. We are
        commanded to put on ‘for an helmet the hope of salvation,’ 1
        Thessalonians 5:8.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the preceding verse the Apostle had said, ‘We wait for the adoption,
        to wit, the redemption of our body.’ Here he gives it as a reason of our
        waiting, that as yet we are saved only in hope. As far as the price of
        redemption is concerned, we are already saved; but in respect to the
        power by which we shall be put in possession of that for which the price
        has been paid, namely, our deliverance from the remainder of sin under
        which we groan, the resurrection of our bodies, and the enjoyment of the
        eternal inheritance, we are saved only in hope. The hope of all this is
        present with us, but the enjoyment is future. Hope that is seen is not
        hope. — That is, hope cannot respect anything which we already enjoy.
        For it is impossible, as the Apostle subjoins, for a man to hope for
        that which he possesses. Hope and possession are ideas altogether
        incongruous and contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers, then, are as yet saved only in hope. They have received but
        the earnest and foretaste of their salvation. They groan under the
        weight which is borne by them, and their bodies are subject to the
        sentence of temporal death. If they were in the full possession of their
        salvation, faith would no longer be the conviction of things hoped for,
        as things hoped for are not things enjoyed. This corresponds with what
        the Apostle says elsewhere, when he exhorts believers to work out their
        salvation, and when he remarks that our elevation is nearer than when we
        first believed. When it is said we are saved in hope, as it supposes our
        felicity to be future, so it implies that all the good we can for the
        present enjoy of that distant and future felicity is obtained by hoping
        for it; and, therefore, if we could not hope for it, we should lose all
        the encouragement we have in the prospect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — But; if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
        wait for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope produces patience with respect to all the, trials, and labors, and
        difficulties that must be encountered before we obtain its object. Since
        we hope for what we see not, — that is, for what we possess not, — there
        must consequently be a virtue by which, being held firm, we wait for it,
        and that is patience. For between hope and enjoyment of the thing hoped
        for a delay intervenes, and there are many temptations within, and
        afflictions from without, by which hope would be turned into despair, if
        it were not supported by patience. As long as hope prevails, the combat
        will not be given up. In the 23rd verse, believers are said to be
        waiting for the adoption; here the inducement to their waiting, and
        patiently waiting, is stated, — it is their hope supported by patience.
        Patiently bearing their present burden, and waiting for heaven, implies
        their expectation that it is reserved for them. They have been begotten
        again to a lively hope of possessing it by the resurrection of Jesus
        Christ from the dead, which is a sure pledge of the redemption of their
        bodies from the grave. This verse and the preceding teach the importance
        of hope to believers, and of their obeying the exhortation to give all
        diligence to the full assurance of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hope of beholding Jesus as he is, and of obtaining ‘a better
        resurrection,’ is calculated to enable them patiently to sustain the
        sufferings of the present time. This hope is represented as encouraging
        the Lord Himself, ‘who for the joy that was set before Him endured the
        cross, despising the shame,’ Hebrews 12:2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know
        not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh
        intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers have need of patience, that, after they have done the will of
        God, they may receive the promise; but their patience is not perfect as
        it ought to be, and they are often ready to cast away their confidence,
        although it hath great recompense of reward. For their support, then, in
        their warfare, which is attended with so much difficulty, the Apostle
        presents a variety of considerations. He had reminded them, in the 17th
        verse, of their communion with Jesus Christ, and that, if they suffer
        with Him, they shall with Him also be glorified. In the 18th verse, he
        had told them that their sufferings bear no proportion to that glory of
        which they shall be made partakers. He had next drawn an argument, from
        the present state of creation, suffering, but waiting for and expecting
        its deliverance, and the manifestation of the sons of God; and reminding
        them of the pledges they had already received of that glorious
        manifestation, he had spoken of its certainty, although still future,
        and therefore as yet enjoyed only in hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as they might still object, How, even admitting the force of these
        encouragements, can we, who are so weak in ourselves, and so inferior in
        power to the enemies we have to encounter, bear up under so many trials?
        the Apostle, in the verse before us, points out an additional and
        internal source of encouragement of the highest consideration, namely,
        that the Holy spirit helps their infirmities, and also prays for them,
        which is sufficient to allay every desponding fear, and to communicate
        the strongest consolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the close of the sacred canon, the Church is represented as saying,
        ‘Come, Lord Jesus.’ Being a stranger on earth, and her felicity
        consisting in communion with her glorious Lord, she groans on account of
        His absence, and ardently desires His holy and blessed presence. In the
        meantime, however, He vouchsafes to His people great consolation to
        compensate for His absence. He assures them that He has ascended to His
        Father and their Father, to His God and their God; that in His Father’s
        house are many mansions; that He is gone to prepare a place for them;
        and that, when He has prepared a place He will return and receive them
        to Himself, that where He is they may be also. They also know the way,
        He Himself being the way and their guide. How encouraging is this
        doctrine, and how well calculated for the support of hope and patience
        in expecting the return of the Bridegroom! If He is gone to their common
        Father, communion in His glory will not long be delayed. If there be
        many mansions in the house of their Heavenly Father, these are prepared
        to receive not only the elder Brother, but all His brethren; for were
        there only one abode, it would be for Him alone. If He is gone to
        prepare a place, and if He is soon to come again to receive them to
        Himself, is it not calculated to fill them with joy in the midst of
        troubles and afflictions? But all these consolations would be
        insufficient unless Jesus had added, that He would not leave them
        orphans, but would give them another Comforter to abide with them for
        ever, even the Spirit of truth. Without such support they would be
        overwhelmed by the weight of their afflictions, and overcome by their
        manifold temptations. But since they have not only an almighty Surety,
        but also an almighty Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, who dwells in
        them, and abides with them, this is sufficient to confirm their joy, to
        establish their hope, and to give them the assurance that nothing shall
        separate them from the love of Christ. Such is the consolation, in
        addition to all the others which, in the passage before us, the Apostle
        presents. Likewise the Spirits also helpeth our infirmities. — Likewise,
        or in like manner, as we are supported by hope, so the Spirit also helps
        our infirmities. The expression helpeth our infirmities, is very
        significant. The Apostle intends to say that the Holy Spirit carries, or
        bears with us, our afflictions. If it be inquired why this help which we
        received from the Holy Spirit is distinguished from the support we have
        from hope and patience, the answer is, that the Holy Spirit supports us,
        as being the efficient principle and first cause; and hope and patience
        supports as His instruments. On this account the Apostle, after having
        referred to the two former, speaks of this support of the Spirit. And
        here we find the most abundant consolation in Him who is the promised
        Comforter, for the all-powerful God Himself comes to help our
        infirmities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul does not say infirmity, but infirmities, that we may remember how
        numerous they are, and may humble ourselves before God, renouncing our
        pride and presumption, and imploring His support. He also says, our
        infirmities, thus recognizing them as also his own, and reminding the
        strongest of their weakness. The burdens of believers are of two kinds:
        the one is sin, the other is suffering. Under both of these they are
        supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to sin, Jesus has charged Himself with it. ‘He bore our sins in His
        own body on the tree;’ and as to sufferings, they are helped by the Holy
        Spirit, but only in part, by imparting strength to bear them; for all
        Christians must bear their cross in following Jesus. But in the kingdom
        of heaven, where every tear shall be wiped from their eyes, they shall
        be for ever delivered from all suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians have at present many infirmities; they are in themselves
        altogether weakness; but the Holy Spirit dwells in their hearts, and is
        their strong consolation. Without Him they could not bear their trials,
        or perform what they are called to endure. But as He dwells in them, He
        gives them that aid of which they stand in need. Are we weak, and our
        troubles great? Here the almighty God comes to support us. Are we bowed
        down under the weight of our afflictions? Behold, He who is all-powerful
        bears them with us! The care of shepherds over their flocks, and the
        care of mothers who carry their infants in their bosoms, are but feeble
        images of the love of God and the care He exercises over His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mother may forsake her sucking child, but the Lord will not forsake
        His children. ‘When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord
        will take me up.’ For we know not what we should pray for as we ought;
        but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which
        cannot be uttered. — There are two things in prayer: namely, the matter
        of prayer, that is, the things we ask for, and the act of prayer, by
        which we address God respecting our desires and necessities. But so
        great is the infirmity and ignorance of the believer, that he does not
        even know what he ought to ask. He is not thoroughly acquainted either
        with his dangers or his wants.
      </p>
      <p>
        He needs not only to be supplied from on high, but also Divine guidance
        to show him what he wants. When he knows not what to ask, the office of
        the Holy Spirit in the heart is to assist him in praying. Though, in a
        peculiar sense, Jesus is the believer’s intercessor in heaven, yet the
        Holy Spirit intercedes in him on earth, teaching him what to ask, and
        exciting in him groanings expressive of his wants, though they cannot be
        uttered; that is, they cannot be expressed in words. Yet these wants are
        uttered in groans, and in this manner most emphatically express what is
        meant, while they indicate the energy of the operation of the Spirit.
        Here the Apostle goes farther than in the former clause of the verse,
        and shows that the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, by referring to a
        particular example of this aid. In order to prove the extent of our
        weakness, the importance of the help of the Holy Spirit, and the
        greatness of the assistance He gives, Paul declares that we know not
        what we should pray for as we ought. Our blindness and natural ignorance
        are such, that we know not how to make a proper choice of the things for
        which we ought to pray. Sometimes we are ready to ask what is not
        suitable, as when Moses prayed to be allowed to enter Canaan, although,
        as being a type of Christ, he must die before the people, for whom he
        was the mediator, could enter the promised land; and as Paul, when He
        prayed to be delivered from the thorn in his flesh, not understanding
        that it was proper that he should be thus afflicted, that he might not
        be exalted above measure. Sometimes, too, we ask even for things that
        would be hurtful were we to receive them; of which there are many
        examples in Scripture, as James 4:3.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people of God are often so much oppressed, and experience such
        anguish of mind, that their agitated spirits, borne down by affliction,
        can neither perfectly conceive nor properly express their complaints and
        requests to God. Shall they then remain without prayer? No; the Holy
        Spirit acts in their hearts, exciting in them sighs and groans. Such
        appear to have been the groanings of Hezekiah, when he said, ‘Like a
        crane or a swallow, so did I chatter; I did mourn as a dove; mine eyes
        fail with looking upward; O Lords I am oppressed, undertake for me.’
        Such also was the experience of David in the <197701> seventy-seventh
        Psalm, when he says, ‘I am so troubled that I cannot speak.’ Thus, too,
        Hannah ‘space in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not
        heard.’ No words of Peter in his repentance are recorded; his groanings
        are represented by his weeping bitterly; and in the same way we read of
        the woman who was a sinner as only washing the feet of Jesus with her
        tears, which expressed the inward groanings of her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these sightings or groanings of the children of God are here
        ascribed to the Holy spirit, it is not to be supposed that the Divine
        Spirit can be subject to such emotions or perturbations of mind; but it
        is so represented, because He: draws forth these groans from our hearts
        and excites them there. Thus it is for hearts that groan, but the
        operation and emotion is from the Holy Spirit; for the subject of these,
        and He who produces them, must not be confounded. In this way the
        Apostle speaks in the fourth chapter to the Galatians. ‘Because ye are
        sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,
        crying, Abba, Father.’ And in the 15th verse of the chapter before us,
        he shows that it is we who cry ‘Abba, Father,’ in order that we may
        observe that it is not the Spirit who cries, who prays, who groans, but
        that He causes us to cry, and pray, and groan. Such, then, is the work
        of the Holy Spirit here spoken of in the heart of believers, from which
        we learn that if there be any force in us to resist evil, and to
        overcome temptation, it is not of ourselves, but of our God. And hence
        it follows that if we have borne up under any affliction or temptation,
        we ought to render thanks to God, seeing that by His power He has
        supported us, and to pray, as David did, ‘Uphold me with Thy free
        Spirit.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit often, in a peculiar manner, helpeth the infirmities of
        the children of God in the article of death enabling them to sustain the
        pains and weaknesses of their bodies, and supporting their souls by His
        consolations in that trying hour. The body is then borne down with
        trouble, but the mind is sustained by the consolations of God. The eye
        of the body is dim, but the eye of faith is often at that season most
        unclouded. The outward man perisheth, but the inward man is renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, when Satan makes his last and greatest effort to subvert the soul,
        and comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard
        against him, exciting in the believer a more ardent faith, and consoling
        him, though unable to express it, with a strong conviction of the Divine
        love and faithfulness. It is by this means that so many martyrs have
        triumphantly died, surmounting, by the power of the Spirit within them,
        the apprehension of the most excruciating bodily torture, and rejoicing
        in the midst of their sufferings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 27. — And He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
        the Spirit, because He maketh intercession for the saints according to
        the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be objected, To what purpose are those groanings which we
        cannot understand? To this the Apostle very fully replies in this verse,
        — 1. God knows what these prayers mean, for ‘He searcheth the hearts’ of
        men, of which he hath perfect knowledge. The believer sighs and groans,
        while, owing to his perplexity and distress, he cannot utter a word
        before God; nevertheless these sighs and groanings are full of meaning.
        2. God knoweth what is ‘the mind of the Spirit,’ or what He is dictating
        in the heart, and therefore He must approve of it; for the Father and
        Spirit are one. 3. Because, or rather, ‘that He maketh intercession.’ We
        are not to understand His intercession as the reason why God knows the
        mind of the Spirit, but as the reason why He will hear and answer the
        groans which the Holy Spirit excites. A further reason is, that this
        intercession is made for the saints; that is, for the children of God,
        of whom He hath said, ‘Gather My saints together unto Me, those that
        have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice,’ Psalm 1:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it is added, that it is ‘according to God,’ or to the will of
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        These prayers, then, will be heard, because the Spirit intercedes for
        those who are the children of God, and because He excites no desires but
        what are agreeable to the will of God. From all this we see how certain
        it is that these groanings which cannot be uttered must be heard, and
        consequently answered. For ‘this is the confidence that we have in Him,
        that if we ask anything according to His will He heareth us.’ The best
        prayers are not those of human eloquence, but which spring from earnest
        desires of the heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse is replete with instruction as well as consolation. We are
        here reminded that the Lord is the searcher of hearts. ‘Hell and
        destruction are before the Lord; how much more then the hearts of the
        children of men.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The reasons of the perfect knowledge that God has of our hearts, are
        declared in the <19D901> 139th Psalm: — 1. The infinity, the
        omnipresence, and omniscience of God. 2. He forms the heart, and knows
        His own work. 3. He preserves and maintains the heart in all its
        operations. 4. He conducts and leads it, and therefore knows and sees
        it. The prayer of the heart, then, is attended to by God, as well as the
        prayer of the lips. Yet this does not prove that oral prayer is
        unnecessary — not even in our secret devotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage teaches us to look to God for an answer to the secret
        groanings of our heart; but it does not teach us to neglect communing
        with God with our lips, when we can express our thoughts. This is
        abundantly taught in the word of God, both by precept and example.
        Searching the heart is here given as a characteristic peculiar to God.
        As, then, it is ascribed in other passages to our Lord Jesus Christ, He
        must be God. This passage clearly establishes the personal distinction
        between the Father and the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The persons to whom the benefit of this intercession of the Spirit
        extends are said to be saints This proves that none can pray truly and
        effectually except the saints. It is only in the saints that the Spirit
        dwells, and of whose prayers He is the Author; and it is they only who
        are sanctified by Him. It is the saints, then, emphatically, and the
        saints exclusively, for whom the Spirit makes intercession. Such only
        are accepted of God, and fit subjects for the operation of the Spirit;
        but this is not the first work of the Spirit in them. He first
        sanctifies and then intercedes. First, He puts into us gracious
        dispositions, and then stirs up holy desires; and the latter supposes
        the former. In those in whom the Spirit is a Spirit of intercession, in
        them He is a Spirit of regeneration. These are therefore joined together
        in Zechariah 12:10, ‘The Spirit of grace and of supplications.’ None but
        saints have an interest in the blood of Christ, as applied unto them,
        and in His intercession. None are able to pray for themselves, for whom
        Christ does not likewise pray. We can only approach God by the Spirit.
        ‘We have access by one Spirit to the Father,’ Ephesians 2:18. We can
        only pray under the influence of the Holy Spirit with groanings which
        cannot be uttered; while the wicked may groan without prayer. ‘They have
        not cried unto Me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds,’
        Hosea 7:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other reason which renders acceptable to God the prayers and sighs
        excited in the saints by the Holy Spirit, is, that they are according to
        the will of God. The Spirit Himself being God, these requests must be
        agreeable to God. The carnal mind, it is said in verse 7, is enmity
        against God; but the mind (the same word here employed) of the Spirit is
        agreeable to God. The intercession made by the Holy Spirit is according
        to the command and the revealed will of God, and in the name and in
        dependence on Christ the Mediator. The Holy Spirit, then, teaches the
        saints how to pray, and what to pray for. What He teaches them to ask on
        earth, is in exact correspondence with that for which Jesus, their great
        High Priest, is interceding for them in heaven. The intercession of
        Jesus before the throne is an echo to the prayer taught by the Holy
        Spirit in their hearts. It is therefore not only in perfect unison with
        the intercession of Christ, and the indicting of the Holy Spirit, but it
        is in exact conformity to the will of God. Such, then, is the security
        to the saints that their prayers, although only expressed in groans,
        shall be heard by their Father in heaven. ‘The prayer of the upright is
        His delight,’ Proverbs 15:8. ‘He will fulfill the desire of them that
        fear Him,’ <19E519> Psalm 145:19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — And we know that all things work together for good to them
        that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing is more necessary for Christians than to be well persuaded of
        the happiness and privileges of their condition, that they may be able
        to serve God with cheerfulness and freedom of spirit, and to pass
        through the troubles and difficulties of the world. Here, then, is
        further consolation:
      </p>
      <p>
        Christians are often in sorrows, sufferings, and trials. This is not in
        itself joyous, but grievous; but in another point of view it is a matter
        of joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though afflictions in themselves are evil, yet in their effects as
        overruled and directed by God, they are useful. Yea, all things, of
        every kind, that happen to the Christian, are overruled by God for his
        good!
      </p>
      <p>
        Having previously spoken of the various sources of consolation, and, in
        the two preceding verses, of the Spirit helping our infirmities, and
        dictating those prayers which are heard of God, the Apostle now obviates
        another objection. If God hears our sighs and groanings, why are we not
        delivered from our afflictions and troubles? In answer, it is here shown
        that afflictions are salutary and profitable; so that, although they are
        not removed, God changes their natural tendency, and makes them work for
        our good. But in order that none should hereby be led into carnal
        security, the Apostle adds, that those for whom all things work together
        for good are such as love God, and are the called according to His
        purpose. This is not only true in itself, but it is here asserted to be
        a truth known to believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had proposed various considerations, to which he now says we
        know this is to be added. This does not mean that believers know it
        merely in a speculative manner, but that it is a knowledge which enters
        into their heart and affections, producing in them confidence in its
        truth. It is a knowledge of faith which implies certainty and self
        application, by which the believer not only knows but applies the
        promises of God, and is able to say, This promise is mine, it belongs to
        me. For otherwise, what advantage would there be in a general knowledge
        of this fact? where would be its consolation, and where its practical
        use? ‘The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will
        show them His covenant.’ The experience, too, of the believer brings
        home to his mind the conviction of this encouraging truth. The Church of
        Rome accuses of presumption those who make such an application to
        themselves. They allow that the Christian should believe, in general,
        the promises of God, but that, as to a particular self-application or
        appropriation of them, he should hold this in doubt, and be always
        uncertain as to his own salvation. This is to destroy the nature of
        those consolations, and to render them useless. For if, in order to
        console one who is afflicted, it be said to him, ‘All things work
        together for good to them that love God,’ he will answer, True, but I
        must doubt whether this belongs to me; and thus the consolation is made
        of no effect. But if this error be not imbibed, and the duty of such
        appropriation be not denied, why is it that so many believers experience
        so little of this consolation in their afflictions? Is it not because
        they have little of that knowledge of which the Apostle speaks when he
        says, ‘We know that all things work together for good to them that love
        God?’ Carnal affections, the love of the world, and indulgence of the
        flesh, prevent this consideration from being deeply impressed on their
        minds; they also darken their understandings, so as not to allow the
        light of the consolations of God to enter their hearts. But in
        proportion as their hearts are purified from these affections, in the
        same degree it is confirmed in their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objection, why sufferings are not removed, should be answered by
        reminding believers that all things work together for their good. All
        things work together for good to them that love God. — All things,
        whatever they be — all things indefinitely — are here intended. The
        extent of this expression is by many limited to afflictions. ‘Paul, it
        must be remembered,’ says Calvin on this text, ‘is speaking only of
        adversity;’ and he adds, ‘Paul is here speaking of the cross; and on
        this account the observation of Augustine, though true, does not bear on
        this passage — that even the sins of believers are so ordered by the
        providence of God as to serve rather to the advancement of their
        salvation than to their injury.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is true that the Apostle had been referring to the present sufferings
        of believers, and enumerating various special topics of consolation;
        but, approaching to the conclusion of his enumeration, it might be
        expected that the last of them would be no longer of a special but of a
        most comprehensive description. That it is so, the terms he employs
        warrant us to conclude. All things, he says. If the context necessarily
        limited this expression, its universality ought not to be contended for;
        but it does not If it be, as Calvin admits, that what is here said is
        true even of the sins of believers (and if applicable to sins, what else
        can be excepted?), why should the sense be limited to sufferings It is
        much more consolatory, and consequently more to the Apostle’s purpose,
        if literally all things be comprehended; and in this view it would form
        the most complete summing up of his subject. He had been pointing out to
        believers their high privileges as heirs of God, and partakers of glory
        with Christ. He had said that their sufferings in the present time are
        not worthy to be compared with that glory. He had suggested various
        topics to induce them to wait for it with patience; and had given them
        the highest encouragement, from the fact of the working of the Spirit of
        all grace within them, and of the acceptance of that work by God. Is it
        then more than was to be expected, that he should conclude the whole by
        saying that all things, without exception, were concurring for their
        good? Is it too much to suppose that it must be so to them whom he had
        addressed as heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, who are
        therefore under the guidance of the Good Shepherd, and honored by the
        indwelling of the Holy Ghost? Is it more than the Apostle says on
        another occasion, when he uses the very same expression, all things,
        and, so far from intimating any exception, adds a most comprehensive
        catalogue? ‘All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas,
        or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come;
        all are yours, for ye are Christ’s and Christ is God’s,’ Corinthians
        3:21. And again, ‘All things are for your sakes,’ Corinthians 4:15.
        Finally, ought the expression here to be restricted, when it is
        impossible to believe that the same expression, occurring a few
        sentences afterwards, verse 32, can be restricted? That all things work
        together for the good of them that love God, is a truth affording the
        highest consolation. These words teach believers that whatever may be
        the number and overwhelming character of adverse circumstances, they are
        all contributing to conduct them into the possession of the inheritance
        provided for them in heaven. That they are thus working for the good of
        the children of God, is manifest from the consideration that God governs
        the world. The first cause of all is God; second causes are all His
        creatures, whether angels, good or bad men, animals, or the inanimate
        creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second causes move only under His direction; and when God withdraws His
        hand, they cannot more at all, as it is written, ‘In Him we live, and
        move, and have our being.’ As God, then, the first cause, moves all
        second causes against His enemies, so, when He is favorable to us, He
        employs all to move and work for our good, as it is said, ‘In that day
        will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with
        the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and
        will break the bow, and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and
        will make them to lie down safely,’ Hosea 2:18. And as of men it is
        said, ‘When a man’s ways please the Lord, He maketh even his enemies-to
        be at peace with him,’ Proverbs 16:7.
      </p>
      <p>
        If all things work together for good, there is nothing within the
        compass of being that is not, in one way or other, advantageous to the
        children of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the attributes of God, all the offices of Christ, all the gifts and
        graces of the Holy Spirit, are combined for their good. The creation of
        the world, the fall and the redemption of man, all the dispensations of
        Providence, whether prosperous or adverse, all occurrences and events —
        all things, whatsoever they be — work for their good. They work together
        in their efficacy, in their unity, and in their connection. They do not
        work thus of themselves: it is God that turns all things to the good of
        His children. The afflictions of believers, in a peculiar manner,
        contribute to this end. ‘Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now
        have I kept Thy word. It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that
        I might learn Thy statutes.’ ‘Tribulation worketh patience.’ ‘No
        chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous;
        nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
        Unto them which are exercised thereby.’ And believers are chastened by
        God for their profit, that they may be partakers of His holiness. The
        Apostle himself was an example of this, when a thorn in his flesh was
        sent to him to prevent his being exalted above measure. We see how much
        the sufferings of those spoken of in the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews
        were calculated to detach their affections from this present world, and
        lead them to seek a better, even a heavenly country. There is often a
        need be for their being in heaviness through manifold temptations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the sins of believers work for their good, not from the nature of
        sin, but by the goodness and power of Him who brings light out of
        darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everywhere in Scripture we read of the great evil of sin. Everywhere we
        receive the most solemn warning against its commission; and everywhere
        we hear also of the chastisements it brings, even upon those who are
        rescued from its finally condemning power. It is not sin, then, in
        itself that works the good, but God who overrules its effects to His
        children, — shows them, by means of it, what is in their hearts, as well
        as their entire dependence on Himself, and the necessity of walking with
        Him more closely. Their falls lead them to humiliation, to the
        acknowledgment of their weakness and depravity, to prayer for the
        guidance and overpowering influence of the Holy Spirit, to vigilance and
        caution against all carnal security, and to reliance on that
        righteousness provided for their appearance before God. It is evident
        that the sin of Adam, which is the source of all their sins, has wrought
        for their good in raising them to a higher degree of glory. Believers
        fall into sin, and on account of this God hides His face from them, and
        they are troubled; and, like Hezekiah, they go softly. God left Hezekiah
        to himself, but it was to do him good at his latter end.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if our sins work together for our good, shall we sin that grace may
        abound? Far be the thought. This would be entirely to misunderstand the
        grace of God, and to turn it into an occasion of offending Him. Against
        such an abuse of the doctrine of grace, the Apostle contends in the 6th
        chapter of this Epistle. Sin should be considered in its nature, not as
        to what it is adventitiously, or in respect to what is foreign to it.
        Sin as committed by us is only sin, and rebellion against God and the
        holiness of His nature. It ought therefore to be regarded with
        abhorrence, and merits eternal punishment. That it is turned to good, is
        the world of God, and not ours. We ought no more to conclude that on
        this account we may sin, than that wicked men do what is right when they
        persecute the people of God, because persecutions are overruled by Him
        for good. That all things work together for good to them who love God,
        establishes the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints; for if all
        things work together for their good, what or where is that which God
        will permit to lead them into condemnation?
      </p>
      <p>
        That all things happen for the best is a common saying among people of
        the world. This is a fact as to the final issue of the Divine
        administration, by which all things shall be made to contribute to the
        glory of God. But as to sinners individually, the reverse is true. All
        things are indeed working together in one complex plan in the providence
        of God for the good of those who love Him; but so far from working for
        good, or for the best to His enemies, everything is working to their
        final ruin. Both of these effects are remarkably exemplified in the
        lives of Saul and David. Even the aggravated sin of David led him to
        deep humiliation and godly sorrow, to a greater knowledge of his natural
        and original depravity, of the deceitfulness of his heart, and to his
        singing aloud of God’s righteousness. The sins of Saul, as well as
        everything that befell him in God’s providence, led to his becoming more
        hardened in his impiety, and at last conducted him to despair and
        suicide. The histories of many others, both believers and sinners,
        recorded in the Old Testament, abundantly confirm the words of the
        Psalmist, ‘The Lord preserveth all them that love Him, but all the
        wicked will be destroyed.’ ‘The way of the wicked He turneth upside
        down.’
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two scriptures which should fill the people of God with joy
        and consolation. The one is, ‘The Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord
        will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from them that
        love Him,’ Psalm 84:11. The other is the passage before us, ‘All things
        work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called
        according to His purpose.’ If, then, God will withhold nothing that is
        good for us, and will order and dispose of all things for good to us,
        what can be wanting to our absolute and complete security? How admirable
        is the providence of God, not only as all things are ordered by Him, but
        as He overrules whatever is most disordered, and turns to good things
        that in themselves are most pernicious. We admire His providence in the
        regularity of the seasons, of the course of the sun and stars; but this
        is not so wonderful as His bringing good out of evil in all the
        complicated acts and occurrences in the lives of men, and making even
        the power and malice of Satan, with the naturally destructive tendency
        of his works, to minister to the good of His children. That love God. —
        What is said of all things working together for good is here limited to
        those who love God. This is given as a peculiar characteristic of a
        Christian. It imports that all behaviors love God, and that none but
        believers love Him. Philosophers, falsely so called, and men of various
        descriptions, may boast of loving God; but the decision of God Himself
        is, that to love Him is the peculiar characteristic of a Christian. No
        man can love God till He hath shined into his heart to give him the
        light of the knowledge of His glory in the face of Jesus Christ. It is
        therefore only through faith in the blood of Christ that we can love
        God. Until our faith gives us some assurance of reconciliation with God,
        we cannot have the confidence which is essential to loving God. Till
        then we dread God as our enemy, and fear that He will punish us for our
        sins. In loving God, the affections of the believer terminate in God as
        their last and highest end; and this they can do in God only. In
        everything else, there being only a finite goodness, we cannot
        absolutely rest in it. This is the rest that David had when he said,
        ‘Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I
        desire besides Thee; God is the strength of my heart and my portion for
        ever,’ Psalm 73:25. This is what satisfies the believer in his need and
        poverty, and in every situation in which he may be placed, for it
        suffices him to have God for his heritage and his possession, since God
        is his all; and as this Divine love expels the love of the world, so it
        overcomes the immoderate love of himself. He is led to love what God
        loves, and to hate what God hates, and thus he walks in communion with
        God, loving God, and more and more desiring to comprehend what is the
        breadth and length, and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ
        which passeth knowledge. To those who are the called according to His
        purpose. — This is a further description or characteristic of God’s
        people. They are called not merely outwardly by the preaching of the
        Gospel, for this is common to them with unbelievers, but called also by
        the Spirit, with an internal and effectual calling, and made willing in
        the day of God’s power. They are called according to God’s eternal
        purpose, according to which He knew them, and purposed their calling
        before they were in existence; for all God’s purposes are eternal. It
        imports that their calling is solely the effect of grace; for when it is
        said to be a calling according to God’s purpose, it is distinguished
        from a calling according to works. ‘Who hath saved us, and called us
        with an holy calling, not according to our works but according to His
        own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
        world began,’ 2 Timothy 1:9. It imports that it is an effectual and
        permanent calling; for God’s purposes cannot be defeated. ‘The counsel
        of the Lord, that shall stand.’ Their calling is according to the
        purpose of Him who worketh all things according to the counsel of His
        own will,’ Ephesians 1:11.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 29. — For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
        conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among
        many brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle having exhibited to believers many grounds of consolation,
        to induce them patiently to endure the sufferings of this present time,
        now points to the source of their future glory, in order to assure them
        of its certainty. The easy and natural transition to this branch of his
        subject should be particularly noticed. He had declared in the foregoing
        verse that all things work together for good to them who love God; but
        as it is always necessary to keep in mind that our love to God is not
        the cause of His love to us, nor, consequently, of the privileges with
        which we are favored, but the effects of His loving us, Deuteronomy
        7:6-8; Jeremiah 1:5, the Apostle adds, ‘Who are the called according to
        His purpose.’ This declaration leads at once to a full and most
        encouraging view of the progress of the Divine procedure originating
        with God, and carried, through all its connecting links, forward to the
        full possession of that glory which shall be revealed in us. For whom He
        did foreknow. — The word foreknow has three significations. One is
        general, importing simply a knowledge of things before they come into
        existence. In this general sense it is evident that it is not employed
        in this passage, since it is limited to those whom God predestinated to
        be conformed to the image of His Son. He foreknows all things before
        they come to pass; but here foreknowledge refers only to particular
        individuals. A second signification is a knowledge accompanied by a
        decree. In this sense it signifies ordinance and providence, as it is
        said, Acts 2:23, ‘Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and
        foreknowledge of God;’ that is to say, by the ordinance and providence
        of God. The reason why this word is used to denote the Divine
        determinations is because the foreknowledge of God necessarily implies
        His purpose or decree with respect to the thing foreknown. For God
        foreknows what will be, by determining what shall be. God’s
        foreknowledge cannot in itself be the cause of any event; but events
        must be produced by His decree and ordination. It is not because God
        foresees a thing that it is decreed; but He foresees it because it is
        ordained by Him to happen in the order of His providence. Therefore His
        foreknowledge and decrees cannot be separated; for the one implies the
        other. When He decrees that a thing shall be, He foresees that it will
        be. There is nothing known as what will be, which is not certainly to
        be; and there is nothing certainly to be, unless it is ordained that it
        shall be. All the foreknowledge of future events, then, is founded on
        the decree of God; consequently He determined with Himself from eternity
        everything He executes in time, Acts 15:18. Nothing is contingent in the
        mind of God, who foresees and orders all events according to His own
        eternal and unchangeable will. Jesus Christ was not delivered by God
        fore knowing it before it took place, but by His fixed counsel and
        ordination, or His providence. Thus believers are called elect according
        to the foreknowledge of God the Father, 1 Peter 1:2; and in the same
        chapter, ver. 19, 20, the Apostle Peter says that Jesus Christ was
        foreknown before the foundation of the world. Here foreknown signifies,
        as it is rendered, fore-ordained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third signification of this word consists in a knowledge of love and
        approbation; and in this sense it signifies to choose and recognize as
        His own, as it is said, Romans 11:2, ‘God hath not cast away His people
        whom He foreknew,’ — that is, whom He had before loved and chosen; for
        the Apostle alleges this foreknowledge as the reason why God had not
        rejected His people. In this manner the word ‘know’ is often taken in
        Scripture in the sense of knowing with affection, loving, approving; as
        in the first Psalm, ‘The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the
        way of the ungodly shall perish.’ To know the way of the just, is to
        love, to approve, as appears by the antithesis. Paul says to the
        Corinthians, ‘If any man love God, the same is know of Him,’ 1
        Corinthians 8:3; and to the Galatians, ‘But now after ye have known God
        or rather are known of Him.’ In the same way, God said by His Prophet to
        Israel, ‘You only have I known of all the families of the earth,’ Amos
        3:2. At the day of judgment Jesus Christ will say to hypocrites, ‘I
        never knew you,’ Matthew 7:23; that is to say, He never loved or
        acknowledged them, although He perfectly knew their characters and
        actions. In this last sense the word foreknow is employed in the passage
        before us. Those whom God foreknew — those whom He before loved, chose,
        acknowledged as His own — He predestinated to be conformed to the image
        of His Son It is not a general anticipated knowledge that is here
        intended. The Apostle does not speak of all, but of some, whom in verse
        33 he calls ‘God’s elect;’ and not of anything in their persons, or
        belonging to them, but of the persons themselves, whom it is said God
        foreknew. And He adds, that those whom He foreknew He also did
        predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son; and whom he
        predestinated He also called, and justified, and glorified.
      </p>
      <p>
        By foreknowledge, then, is not here meant a foreknowledge of faith or
        good works, or of concurrence with the external call Faith cannot be the
        cause of foreknowledge, because foreknowledge is before predestination,
        and faith is the effect of predestination. ‘As many as were ordained to
        eternal life believed,’ Acts 13:48. Neither can it be meant of the
        foreknowledge of good works, because these are the effects of
        predestination. ‘We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto
        good works; which God hath before ordained (or before prepared) that we
        should walk in them,’ Ephesians 2:10. Neither can it be meant of
        foreknowledge of our concurrence with the external call, because our
        effectual calling depends not upon that concurrence, but upon God’s
        purpose and grace, given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
        Timothy 1:9. By this foreknowledge, then, is meant, as has been
        observed, the love of God towards those whom He predestinates to be
        saved through Jesus Christ. All the called of God are foreknown by Him,
        — that is, they are the objects of His eternal love, and their calling
        comes from this free love. ‘I have loved thee with an everlasting love;
        therefore with loving-kindness I have drawn thee,’ Jeremiah 31:3. He
        also did predestinate. — Foreknowledge and predestination are
        distinguished. The one is the choice of persons, the other the
        destination of those persons to the blessings for which they are
        designed. To predestinate signifies to appoint beforehand to some
        particular end. In Scripture it is taken sometimes generally for any
        decree of God, as in Acts 4:28, where the Apostles say that the Jews
        were assembled to do whatsoever the hand and the counsel of God had
        determined (predestinated) before to be done. And Paul says, 1
        Corinthians 2:7, ‘We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
        hidden wisdom which God ordained (predestinated) before the world unto
        our glory.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes this word is taken specially for the decree of the salvation
        of man, as Ephesians 1:5, ‘Having predestinated us unto the adoption of
        children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of
        His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace.’ In whom also we have
        obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of
        Him who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will.’ In the
        same way, in the passage before us, ‘Whom He did foreknow, He also did
        predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son.’ As the term is
        here used, it respects not all men, but only those of whom God has
        placed His love from eternity, and on whom He purposes to bestow life
        through Jesus Christ. As, then, it is absolute and complete, so it is
        definite; and the number who are thus predestinated can neither be
        increased nor diminished. It is not that God had foreseen us as being in
        Christ Jesus by faith, and on that account had elected us, but that
        Jesus Christ, being the Mediator between God and man, God had
        predestinated us to salvation only in Him. For as the union which we
        have with Him is the foundation of all the good which we receive from
        God, so we must be elected in Him; that is to say, that God gives us to
        Him to be His members, and to partake in the good things to which God
        predestinates us. So that Jesus Christ has been the first predestinated
        and appointed to be the Mediator, in order that God should bless us with
        all spiritual blessings in Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the passage above quoted, Ephesians 1:5, the cause of predestination
        is traced solely to God. After saying that God had predestinated us unto
        the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, it is added, ‘to Himself,’ to
        show that God has no cause out of Himself moving Him to this grace. In
        order to enforce this, it is further added, ‘according to the good
        pleasure of His will;’ and, in the third place, it is subjoined, ‘to the
        praise of the glory of His grace;’ from all which it follows that it
        must necessarily be by grace, — that is, free, unmerited favor. Love to
        God, or conformity to the image of Christ, cannot in any respect have
        its origin in fallen man. ‘Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
        that He loved us.’ ‘We love Him, because He first loved us.’ ‘It is a
        foolish inference,’ says Calvin, ‘of these disputants, who say that God
        has elected such only as He foresaw would be worthy of grace. For Peter
        does not flatter believers, as if they were elected for their own
        individual merits, but refers their election to the eternal counsel of
        God, and strips them of all worthiness. In this passage, also, Paul
        repeats in another word what he had lately intimated concerning God’s
        eternal purpose; and it hence follows that this knowledge depends on the
        good pleasure of His will, because, by adopting whom He would, God did
        not extend His foreknowledge to anything out of Himself, but only marked
        out those whom He intended to elect.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of predestination is Jesus Christ, by whom we receive the
        adoption of children. Its object is man, not invested with any quality
        which moves God to predestinate him, but as corrupted and guilty in Adam
        — dead in trespasses and sins until quickened by God. The blessing to
        which God had predestinated those whom He foreknew is salvation, as it
        is said, ‘God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
        our Lord Jesus Christ;’ or, as it is expressed in the verse before us,
        ‘to be conformed to the image of His Son.’ The means to all this are our
        calling and justification. The final end of predestination is the glory
        of God, — ’to the glory of His grace;’ ‘and that He might make known the
        riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared
        unto glory.’ On the consideration of their election, the Apostles urge
        believers to walk in holiness. ‘Put on, therefore, as the elect of God,
        holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,
        meekness, long-suffering,’ Colossians 3:12. ‘Ye are a chosen (elected)
        generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that
        ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of
        darkness into His marvelous light,’ 1 Peter 2:9.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the election of some, and the passing by of others, the wisdom of God
        is manifest; for by this means He displays both His justice and mercy, —
        otherwise one of these perfections would not have appeared. If all had
        been withdrawn from their state of corruption, the justice of God would
        not have manifested itself in their punishment. If none had been chosen,
        His mercy would not have been seen. In the salvation of these, God has
        displayed His grace; and in the punishment of sin in the others, He has
        discovered His justice and hatred of iniquity. This doctrine of election
        is full of consolation, and is the true source of Christian assurance.
        For who can shake this foundation, which is more firm than that of the
        heavens and the earth, and can no more be shaken than God Himself? The
        sheep whom God hath given to His Son by His predestination no one can
        pluck out of His hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        But although this doctrine of election of the people of God to eternal
        life is a doctrine so consoling to them, and must have necessarily
        entered into the plan of salvation to render it consistent with itself,
        yet there are many who, in preaching the Gospel, deem it improper,
        notwithstanding they have the express example of our Lord, John
        6:37,44,65, to declare it before promiscuous multitudes, or even
        generally to believers, although so frequently introduced by the
        Apostles in their Epistles to the churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Against this practice, prompted by worldly wisdom, Luther has forcibly
        remonstrated in the following appeal to Erasmus: — ’If, my Erasmus, you
        consider these paradoxes (as you term them) to be no more than the
        inventions of men, why are you so extraordinarily heated on the
        occasion?

        In that case your arguments affect not me; for there is no person now
        living in the world who is a more avowed enemy to the doctrines of men
        than myself. But if you believe the doctrines in debate between us to be
        (as indeed they are) the doctrines of God, you must here bid adieu to
        all sense of shame and decency thus to oppose them. I will not ask,
        whither is the modesty of Erasmus fled? but, which is much more
        important, where, alas! are your fear and reverence of the Deity, when
        you roundly declare that this branch of truth, which He has revealed
        from heaven, is at best useless and unnecessary to know? What! shall the
        glorious Creator be taught by you, His creature, what is fit to be
        preached, and what to be suppressed? Is the adorable God so very
        defective in wisdom and prudence, as not to know, till you instruct Him,
        what would be useful and what pernicious? Or, could not He, whose
        understanding is infinite, foresee, previous to His revelation of this
        doctrine, what would be the consequences of His revealing it, till these
        consequences were pointed out by you? You cannot, you dare not, say
        this. If, then, it was the Divine pleasure to make known these things in
        His word, and to bid His messengers publish them abroad, and to leave
        the consequences of their so doing to the wisdom and providence of Him
        in whose name they speak, and whose message they declare, who art thou,
        O Erasmus, that thou shouldst reply against God?’ To be conformed to the
        image of His Son. — This implies that the children of God must all be
        made to resemble Christ, their head and elder brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        This likeness respects character and suffering, as well as all things in
        which such similarity is found to exist. The Lord Jesus Christ, the
        first elect of God, is the model after which all the elect of God must
        be formed. Man was created in the image of God; but when sin entered, he
        lost this image; and Adam ‘begat a son in his own likeness after his
        image,’ Genesis 5:3; thus communicating to his posterity his corrupted
        nature. But as God had determined to save a part of the fallen race, it
        was ‘according to His good pleasure’ to renew His image in those whom He
        had chosen to this salvation. This was to be accomplished by the
        incarnation of His Son, ‘who is the brightness of His glory, and the
        express image of His person,’ to whose image they were predestinated to
        be conformed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This image of the Son of God, consisting in supernatural, spiritual, and
        celestial qualities, is stamped upon all the children of God when they
        are adopted into His family. Imparting to them spiritual life, He
        renders them partakers of the Divine nature; that is to say, of His
        image, being the new man, which after God is created in righteousness
        and true holiness. They are the workmanship of God, erected in Christ
        Jesus, being born of the Spirit, and the Spirit of Christ dwelling in
        them; and he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit. Thus the souls of
        believers are confirmed to the image of Christ, as their bodies will be
        also at his second coming, when they shall be ‘fashioned like unto His
        glorious body.’ To this conformity to the image of His Son, all those
        whom God foreknew are predestinated. For as they have borne the image of
        the earthy, they shall also bear the image of the heavenly Adam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers are conformed to the image of the Son of God in holiness and
        suffering in this life, and in glory in the life to come. They are
        conformed to Him in holiness, for Christ is made unto them
        sanctification. Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, they are
        changed into the same image.
      </p>
      <p>
        They put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image
        of Him that erected him. In suffering they are conformed to Him who was
        ‘a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.’ They must endure
        tribulation, and fill up what is behind of His affection. As the Captain
        of their salvation was made perfect through sufferings, and through
        sufferings entered into His glory, so the sufferings of His people,
        while they promote their conformity to Him in holiness constitute the
        path in which they follow Him to that glory. ‘Ye are they who have
        continued with Me in My temptations, and I appoint unto you a kingdom.’
        What the Apostle hath said in the 17th verse, that if believers suffer
        with Christ they share also be glorified together, is here confirmed by
        his declaration that they are predestinated to be conformed to His
        image. This image, of which the outlines are in this world traced in
        them, is only perfected in heaven. That He might be the Firstborn among
        many brethren. — Here is a reason for those whom God foreknew being
        conformed to the image of His Son; and a limitation of that conformity
        which they shall have to Him. The reason is, that He might have many
        brethren. Next to the glory of God, the object of His incarnation was
        the salvation of a multitude which no man can number of those whose
        nature He assumed, and this was accomplished by His death. Referring to
        this, He Himself says, ‘Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and
        die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.’
        Accordingly, in the everlasting covenant between the Father and the Son,
        when grace was given to His people in Him before the world began, 2
        Timothy 1:9, and when God promised to Him for them eternal life also
        before the world began, Titus 1:2, it was determined that when He should
        make His soul an offering for sin, He should see of the travail of His
        soul and be satisfied, and that by the knowledge of Him many should be
        justified. He was to bear the sins of many. ‘ Glorify Thy Son, that Thy
        Son also may glorify Thee; as Thou hast given Him power over all flesh,
        that He might give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him.’ By
        His obedience many were to be made righteous. As the Captain of their
        salvation, He was to bring many sons unto glory. To Him many shall come
        from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and
        Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. ‘The gift by grace which is by one man
        Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many.’ And as He that sanctifieth and
        they who are sanctified are all of one, He is not ashamed to call them
        brethren. But as in all things He must have the pre-eminence, so this
        limitation is introduced, that among them all He must be the
        ‘firstborn;’ that is to say, the first, the principal the most
        excellent, The Governor, the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the law, the firstborn had authority over their brethren, and to
        them belonged a double portion, as well as the honor of acting as
        priests, — the firstborn in Israel being holy, that is to say,
        consecrated to the Lord Reuben, forfeiting his right of primogeniture by
        his sin, its privileges were divided, so that the dominion belonging to
        it was transferred to Judah, and the double portion to Joseph, who had
        two tribes and two portions in Canaan, by Ephraim and Manasseh; while
        the priesthood and right of sacrifice was transferred to Levi. The word
        first to born also signifies what surpasses anything else of the same
        kind, as ‘the firstborn of the poor,’ Isaiah 14:30, that is to say, the
        most miserable of all; and the firstborn of death, Job 18:13, signifying
        a very terrible death, surpassing in grief and violence. The term
        firstborn is also applied to those who were most beloved, as Ephraim is
        called the firstborn of the Lord, Jeremiah 31:9, that is, His ‘dear
        son.’ In all these respects the appellation of firstborn belongs to
        Jesus Christ, both as to the superiority of His nature, of His office,
        and of His glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding His nature, He was as to His divinity truly the firstborn,
        since He alone is the only-begotten — the eternal Son of the Father. In
        this respect He is the Son of God by nature, while His brethren are sons
        of God by grace. In His humanity He was conceived without sin, beloved
        of God; instead of which they are conceived in sin, and are by nature
        children of wrath. In that nature He possessed the Spirit without
        measure; while they receive out of His fullness according to the measure
        of the gift of Christ. Regarding his office, He is their King, their
        Head, their Lord, their Priest, their Prophet, their Surety, their
        Advocate with the Father, — in one word, their Savior. It is He who of
        God is made unto them wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
        redemption. They are all His subjects, whom He leads and governs by His
        Spirit, for whose sins He has made atonement by His sufferings. They are
        His disciples, whom He has called from darkness into His marvelous
        light. Concerning His glory, ‘God hath highly exalted Him, and given Him
        a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee
        should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
        the earth.’ ‘He is the head of the body, the Church; what is the
        beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things He might have
        the pre-eminence He is the firstborn from the dead, as being raised the
        first, and being made the first-fruits of them that slept; and by His
        power they shall be raised to a life glorious and eternal.

        Ver. 30. — Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and
        whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He
        also glorified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called — Here the
        Apostle connects our calling, which is known, with God’s decree, which
        is concealed, to teach us that we may judge of our election by our
        calling Peter 1:10. For Paul says, they whom God hath predestinated He
        hath also called and justified; so we may say, those whom He hath called
        and justified He hath elected and predestinated. If God hath called us,
        then He hath elected us. Paul had spoken of God’s predestining His
        people to be conformed to the image of His Son: He now shows us how this
        is effected.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are to be molded into this likeness to their elder Brother by being
        called both by the word and Spirit of God. God calls them by His grace,
        Galatians 1:15, — that is, without regard to anything in themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effectual calling is the first internal operation of grace on those who
        are elected. They are not merely called externally, as many who are not
        elected. The scriptures speak of the universal call of the Gospel,
        addressed to all men; but this is not inseparably connected with
        salvation; for in this sense the Lord has said that ‘many are called,
        but few are chosen.’ At three periods, all mankind were called. They
        were called through Adam; they were called by Noah; and, finally, by the
        Apostles, Colossians 1:23; yet how soon in each period was the external
        call forgotten by the great body of the human race ‘They did not like to
        retain God in their knowledge.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In the passage before us, and in various other places, as in verse 28,
        it is effectual calling that is spoken of. This calling, then, signifies
        more than the external calling of the word. It is accompanied with more
        than the partial and temporary effects which the word produces on some,
        and is always ascribed to the operation of God by the influence of the
        Holy Spirit. Even when the external means are employed to most
        advantage, it is God only who gives the increase, 1 Corinthians 3:6. It
        is He who opens the heart to receive the word, Acts 16:14, — who gives a
        new heart, Ezekiel. 36:26, — who writes His law in it, — and who saves
        His people, not by works of righteousness which they have done, but by
        the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, Titus 3:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        That which is meant, then, by the word called in this passage, and in
        many others, is the outward calling by the word accompanied with the
        operation of God, by His Spirit, in the regeneration and conversion of
        sinners. When Jesus Christ thus calls, men instantly believe, Matthew
        4:19. Grace — the operation of the favor of God in the heart — is
        communicated, and the sinner becomes a new creature. Regeneration is not
        a work which is accomplished gradually; it is effected instantaneously.
        At first, indeed, faith is often weak; but as the new-born infant is as
        much in possession of life as the full-grown man, so the spiritual life
        is possessed as completely in the moment of regeneration as ever it is
        afterwards, and previous to that moment it had no existence. There is no
        medium between life and death: a man is either dead in sin, or quickened
        by receiving the Holy Spirit; he is either in Christ, or out of Christ;
        God has either begun a good work in him, or he is in a state of
        spiritual death and corruption. By means of the word, accompanied by His
        Spirit, God enlightens the understanding with a heavenly light, moves
        the will and the affections to receive and embrace Christ, and forms in
        the heart His image and the new man, of which the Apostle says that it
        is created in righteousness and true holiness. God says, ‘Awake, thou
        that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
        light.’ He prophesies upon the dry bones, and the Spirit enters into
        them. Thus the same grace that operates in the election of the saints is
        exercised in their calling and regeneration, without which they would
        remain dead in trespasses and sins. ‘No man,’ says Jesus, ‘can come to
        Me, except the Father which hath sent Me, draw him.’
      </p>
      <p>
        All who are elected are in due time effectually called, and all who are
        effectually called have been from all eternity elected and ordained to
        eternal salvation. Effectual calling, then, is the proper and necessary
        consequence and effect of election, and the means to glorification. As
        those whom God hath predestinated He hath called, so He hath effectually
        called none besides. These words before us, therefore, are to be taken
        not only as emphatical, but as exclusive. Consistently with this, we
        read of the faith of God’s elect, Titus 1:1, as that which is peculiar
        to them. With this calling sanctification is inseparably connected. It
        is denominated a holy calling. ‘Who hath saved us and called us with an
        holy calling, Timothy 1:9. The Author of it is holy, and it is a call to
        holiness. ‘As He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
        manner of conversation,’ 1 Peter 1:15. ‘Ye are a chosen generation, a
        royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show
        forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His
        marvelous light,’ 1 Peter 2:9. It is a calling into the grace of Christ,
        Galatians 1:6. In this effectual calling the final perseverance of the
        saints is also secured, since it stands connected on the one hand with
        election and predestination, and on the other hand with sanctification
        and glorification. ‘The gifts and calling of God are without
        repentance.’ Calling, as the effect of predestination, must be
        irresistible, or rather invincible, and also irreversible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church of Rome perverts the meaning of this calling; for, instead of
        considering it as accompanied with the communication of life to the
        soul, they view it merely as an act which excites and calls into action
        some concealed qualities in man, and awakens some feelings of holiness
        that are in him, and some virtues which he possesses, to receive the
        grace that is proclaimed to him. In this way it must not be said, with
        the Scripture, that God communicates life to those who are dead in
        trespasses and sins, and regenerates them, but that He only aids their
        weakness, and calls forth their own exertions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it be inquired whether God calls all men with a calling sufficient
        for their salvation, that is to say, if He gives to all grace sufficient
        to save them, it is replied, that this calling may be considered as
        sufficient or insufficient in different points of view; for the
        sufficiency of grace may be considered either on the part of God or of
        man. On the part of God, it must be said that His general calling is
        sufficient, for God having created man upright, with a disposition to
        obey Him, if we consider this general calling connected with that
        original perfection, there can be no doubt that it is sufficient. But,
        on the part of man, viewed in his natural state of corruption, assuredly
        the outward call is not sufficient, unless accompanied with the internal
        operation of the Holy Spirit, to enlighten the eyes of the
        understanding, and to open the heart to receive the calling of God, any
        more than if Jesus Christ had spoken to a deaf or dead man, without
        removing his deafness, or imparting to him life. If the voice of Jesus
        calling Lazarus had been unaccompanied with His power, it would not have
        been sufficient to raise him from the grave. The calling, then, which is
        not accompanied with the power of the Spirit of God, is not sufficient
        in regard to man, while man is inexcusable, and has no just ground of
        complaint, for he resists that call which, unless he was a sinful
        creature and an enemy to God, would be sufficient. He is, as the
        Psalmist says, ‘like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; which will
        not hearken to the voice of the charmers, charm they never so wisely.’
      </p>
      <p>
        If, again, it be inquired whether men can resist the calling of God, it
        is evident that, when the calling is only external, and unaccompanied
        with the internal operation of the Spirit, they can, and always will,
        resist it, Genesis 6:3; Acts 7:51. But when the calling is, at the same
        time, internal, — when God regenerates men, and makes them new
        creatures, — the question, if they can resist this, is altogether
        nugatory; for it is as if it were inquired if a man could resist his
        creation, or a dead man his being brought to life. God here acts by His
        almighty power, without, however, forcing our will; for communicating to
        us spiritual qualities, He gives us to will and to do of His good
        pleasure. It is therefore absurd to say that a man can resist this
        influence by the hardness of his heart, since it removes that hardness,
        and is the converting of hearts of stone into hearts of flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        In opposition to this, the saying of our Lord is stated as an objection:
        ‘Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
        works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they
        would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.’ On this it is to
        be remarked, that the reference here is to Christ’s miracles, not to His
        preaching; and what is said of Tyre and Sidon is by comparison, what is
        meant being, as it seems, that the hardness of heart of those of
        Chorazin and Bethsaida surpassed that of Tyre and Sidon, and that if
        such miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would not have
        had so little effect as upon the former, although it is not said that
        the latter would have repented unto life, or that they could have been
        conferred to God except by the operation of His Spirit. Here the
        declaration of our Lord in the same context is decisive: ‘At that time
        Jesus answered and said, I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
        earth, because Thou hast hid these things (the truths of God which He
        proclaimed) from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
        babes.’ And this He resolves, not into the difference found in man, but
        into the sovereignty of God. ‘Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in
        Thy sight.’ And He immediately adds, ‘Neither knoweth any man the Father
        save the Son, and He to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.’ This must
        refer to an internal revelation; for as to that which was solely
        external, Jesus was declaring it to all. Jesus Christ knew from the
        beginning who they were that would believe and who would not believe,
        because He knew who they were whom the Father had given Him and would
        draw unto Him. And it is this eternal decree which He here shows is the
        rule of God’s calling, according to which the Son is or is not revealed:
        ‘Ye believe not, because ye are not of My sheep, as I said unto you.’
        And whom He called, them He also justified. — They whom the Holy Spirit
        effectually calls by the Gospel to the knowledge of God are also
        justified. They are ‘ungodly,’ Romans 4:5, till the moment when they are
        called; but, being then united to Christ, they are in that moment
        justified. They are instantly absolved from guilt, and made righteous,
        as having perfectly answered all the demands of the law, for by Him it
        has been fulfilled in them, verse 4. To justify signifies to pronounce
        and account righteous such as have transgressed, and forfeited the favor
        of God, as well as incurred a penalty, conveying to them deliverance
        from the penalty, and restoration to that favor. And they who are thus
        accounted righteous by God, must be righteous, for God looks upon things
        as they really are; as, being one with Christ, they are perfectly
        righteous. ‘Justification,’ says Luther, ‘takes place when, in the just
        judgment of God, our sins, and the eternal punishment due to them, are
        remitted, and when clothed with the righteousness of Christ, which is
        freely imputed to us, and reconciled to God, we are made His beloved
        children, and heirs of eternal life.’ The connection between calling and
        justification is manifest, for we must be united to Christ to enjoy the
        good derived from Him. We must be members of Christ that His obedience
        may be ours that in Him we may have righteousness. Now, he is by our
        calling that we are brought into His communion, and by communion with
        Him to the participation of His grace and blessing, which cannot fail to
        belong to them who are with Him one body, one flesh, and one spirit.
        Those who are called must therefore be justified. They who are the
        members of Jesus Christ must be partakers in His righteousness, and of
        the Spirit of life that is in Him. Whom He calls He justifies. This
        proves that there are none justified till they are called. We are
        justified by faith, which we receive when we are effectually called.
        Whom He justified, them He also glorified. — A man is justified the
        moment He believes in Christ; and here being glorified is connected with
        justification. No believer, then, finally comes short of salvation. If
        he is justified, he must in due time be glorified. To be glorified is to
        be completely conformed to the glorious image of Jesus Christ; when we
        shall see Him as He is, and be made like unto Him, enjoying that
        felicity which the Psalmist anticipated: ‘Thou wilt show me the path of
        life; in Thy presence is fullness of joy; at Thy right hand there are
        pleasures for evermore.’ The glorifying of the saints will have its
        consummation in the day of the blessed resurrection, when their bodies
        shall be made like unto the glorious body of Jesus Christ; when that
        natural body, which was sown in corruption, in dishonor, in weakness,
        shall be raised a spiritual body in corruption, in glory, in power. Then
        death will be swallowed up in victory, all tears shall be wiped away,
        the Lamb will lead and feed them, and God shall be all in all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse glorification is spoken of as having already taken place,
        because what God has determined to do may be said to be already done.
        ‘He calls those things that be not as though they were.’ The Apostle
        does not say that those whom God predestinates He calls, and that those
        whom He justifies He glorifies; but, speaking in the past time, he says
        that those whom God did predestinate, them He hath also called, and
        justified, and glorified. By this he expresses the certainty of the
        counsel of God. In the same way, in the Old Testament, things future
        were spoken of as already accomplished, on account of the infallibility
        of the promises of God; so that, before Jesus Christ came into the
        world, it was said, ‘Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.’
        And He Himself speaks of what is future as already accomplished. ‘I have
        finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do.’ ‘Now I am no more in the
        world,’ John 17:4,11. In like manner the Apostle speaks here of glory as
        already come, to show how certain it is that those who are called and
        justified shall be glorified. And this is in accordance with the object
        he has in view, which is to console the believer amidst his afflictions.
        For when he thus suffers, and all things appear to conspire for his
        ruin, and to be opposed to his eternal salvation, he is represented as
        already glorified by God, and during the combat as having already
        received the crown of life.

        The plan of salvation is here set before us in its commencement, in the
        intermediate steps of its progress, and in its consummation. Its
        commencement is laid in the eternal purpose of God, and its consummation
        in the eternal glory of the elect. He calls those whom He hath
        predestinated to faith in Christ, to repentance and to a new life. He
        justifies by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ those whom He
        hath called; and, finally, He will glorify those whom He hath justified.
        The opponents of the doctrine contained in this passage distort the
        whole plan of salvation. They deny that there is any indissoluble
        connection between those successive steps of grace, which are here
        united by the Apostle, and that these different expressions relate to
        the same individuals. They suppose that God may have foreknown and
        predestinated to life some whom He does not call, that He effectually
        calls some whom He does not justify, and that He justifies others whom
        He does not glorify. This contradicts the express language of this
        passage, which declares that those whom He foreknew He predestinated,
        that those whom he predestinated them He also called, that those whom He
        called them He also justified, and that those whom He justified them He
        also glorified. It is impossible to find words which could more forcibly
        and precisely express the indissoluble connection that subsists between
        all the parts of this series, or show that they are the same individuals
        that are spoken of throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same doctrine is in other places explicitly taught: ‘Of Him ’ (by
        God, according to His sovereign election) ‘are ye in Christ Jesus, who
        of God’ (by the appointment of God) ‘is made unto us wisdom’ (in our
        calling), ‘righteousness’ (by the imputation of His righteousness),
        ‘sanctification’ (in making us conformed to His image), and ‘redemption’
        (in giving us eternal glory). ‘These truths are also declared in 2
        Thessalonians 2:13. ‘God hath from the beginning chosen you to
        salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth
        whereunto He called you by our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of
        our Lord Jesus Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        It is, indeed, often objected to the doctrine of grace, that, according
        to it, men may live as they list; if they are certainly to be saved,
        they may indulge in sin with impunity. But, according to Paul’s
        statements in this chapter, all the doctrines respecting the salvation
        of the elect are indissolubly connected, and a single link in the chain
        is never wanting. He who has ordained the end, has ordained the means.
        He who has chosen them in Christ, from before the ‘foundation of the
        world, has chosen them through sanctification of the Spirit and belief
        of the truth, Thessalonians 2:13. If they are predestinated to be
        conformed to the image of the Son, they are in due time called by the
        word and Spirit of God. If they are called, they are justified, so that
        there is no unrighteousness to stand in the way of their acceptance. If
        they are justified, they will also be glorified in the appointed season.
        How fatally erroneous, then, is the opinion of those who say that, if we
        are predestinated, we shall obtain eternal glory in whatever way we
        live! Such a conclusion breaks this heavenly chain. It is vain for human
        ingenuity to attempt to find an imperfection in the plans of Divine
        wisdom in ordering the steps in the salvation of His people: ‘the word
        of God effectually worketh in them that believe,’ 1 Thessalonians 2:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the passage before us, we see that all the links of that chain by
        which man is drawn up to heaven, are inseparable. In the whole of it
        there is nothing but grace, whether we contemplate its beginning, its
        middle, or its end. Each of its parts furnishes the most important
        instruction. If we are elected, let us feel and experience in ourselves
        the effects of our election. If we are called, let us walk worthy of our
        vocation. If we are justified, let us, like Abraham show our faith and
        prove our justification by our works. If we shall be glorified, let us
        live as fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God. Let
        our conversation be in heaven, and let us confess that we are pilgrims
        and strangers on the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In looking back on this passage, we should observe that, in all that is
        stated, man acts no part, but is passive, and all is done by God. He is
        elected, and predestinated, and called, and justified, and glorified by
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle was here concluding all that he had said before in
        enumerating topics of consolation to believers, and is now going on to
        show that God is ‘for us,’ or on the part of His people. Could anything,
        then, be more consolatory to those who love God, than to be in this
        manner assured that the great concern of their salvation is not left in
        their own keeping God, even their covenant God, hath taken the whole
        upon Himself. He hath undertaken for them. There is no room, then, for
        chance or change: He will perfect that which concerneth them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same great truths are held forth in every part of the new covenant
        which God makes with His people, Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:8-12. It
        consists exclusively of absolute promises on the part of God, and from
        beginning to end is grace and only grace. But does the doctrine of grace
        encourage licentiousness? To assert this directly contradicts the
        Scriptures, which show that grace has the very opposite tendency. ‘The
        grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching
        us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
        righteously, and godly in this present world,’ Titus 2:11,12. Such is
        the testimony of God. ‘The grace of God manifests His love, and produces
        love in us, which is the first-fruit of the spirit, and the foundation
        of all acceptable obedience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let every believer glory in this grace of God by which he is
        predestinated, and called, and justified, and glorified. This is all his
        consolation and all his joy, for it is an indissoluble chain, which
        neither the world nor the powers of hell can break. Does he feel a holy
        sadness for having offended God, a holy desire to struggle against the
        corruptions of his heart, and to advance in the work of sanctification?
        does he hunger and thirst after righteousness, and is he seeking to put
        on the new man, and to possess more of the image of Christ? Let him
        conclude, from these certain marks of his calling, that he is justified,
        the righteousness of Christ being imputed to him, and that his happiness
        is as certain as if he was already glorified. But, on the other hand,
        let none abuse these doctrines. No one shall be glorified who does not
        previously partake of this holy calling. Let no one attempt to take away
        any of the parts of this chain, and to pass from election without the
        intermediate steps to glory. Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.
