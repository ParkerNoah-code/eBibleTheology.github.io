      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 21. — Timotheus my work-fellow, and Lucius, and Jason , and
        Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Timothy was a most devoted servant of the Lord Jesus, more of the same
        spirit with Paul than any of his other fellow-laborers. The Apostle,
        instead of designating himself by the superiority of his office with
        reference to that of Timothy, calls him his work-fellow. How different
        is this from the conduct of those who seek earthly honors and
        distinctions as the servants of Christ! All Christians are not alike
        obedient, and therefore not all equally honored before God; but their
        honor will be revealed in another world, though not in this. The other
        persons mentioned in this salutation were the kinsmen of the Apostle,
        whom he thus honorably recognizes as his relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — I Tertius, who wrote this Epistle, salute you in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle generally employed an amanuensis to write what he dictated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tertius wrote the Epistle, but it was in all things communicated by
        Paul, as what Paul communicated was dictated to him by the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tertius likewise salutes the brethren. In the Lord. — These salutations
        were not those of mere worldly acquaintance or friendship, but in the
        Lord, that is, as a member of the body of Christ of which they were
        members. He might have no acquaintance with any individual among them,
        yet he was full of affection to them as a Christian brother. That
        conformity to the world which the Scriptures condemn, is a conformity to
        things contrary to the law of God. All the innocent customs of society
        may be imitated by Christ’s people without any sin. As the people of the
        world are accustomed to express good will by their salutations, so the
        Lord’s people ought likewise to show their love by similar expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love ought not only to exist in the heart, but also ought, on proper
        occasions, to be outwardly expressed. Without this it cannot edify or
        console those who are its objects. The people of the Lord, then, ought
        to recognize one another, and express their mutual love in all those
        ways usual among men.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 23. — Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you.</p>
      <p>
        Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaius was distinguished for Christian hospitality. The Apostle abode in
        his house at the time of writing this Epistle; but his hospitality was
        of the most liberal and extensive kind. He is praised by the Apostle as
        the host of the whole church. Gaius also sent his salutations to the
        church at Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Christianity does not destroy the different orders in society, all
        Christians are brethren, and recognize each other as such, though of
        different nations and of different ranks. Erastus the chamberlain of the
        city. — This is another personage of distinction who sends his
        salutation to the brethren at Rome. He held an important office in the
        city where he lived. The Apostle designates him as chamberlain, which
        might correspond in a good measure to treasurer. But in such cases in
        most instances no word in one language can be found to correspond
        perfectly to that of another, because no two countries may have the same
        modification of offices. The notice of the office of Erastus, although
        in itself it may appear trifling, is in reality of great importance. It
        shows us that Christians may hold offices even under heathen
        governments, and that to serve Christ we are not to be abstracted from
        worldly business. Quartus a brother. — The Apostle having no peculiar
        distinction to notice in this person, calls him a brother. This was a
        common name for all believers, because they are all brethren in Christ.
        It may at first sight appear superfluous to designate this person by a
        characteristic belonging to all Christians. But though it belongs to all
        Christians, yet it is not endlessly expressed. The Apostle directs
        attention to this circumstance that they are brethren, and that it is a
        real and important relation. We may know that all Christians are
        brethren, but it is nevertheless useful to be reminded of this, as we
        may be prone to act towards them in an unbrotherly manner.
