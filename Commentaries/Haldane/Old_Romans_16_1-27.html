      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>ROMANS 16:1-27</p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — I commend unto you Phebe our sister , which is a servant of
        the church which is at Cenchrea:
      </p>
      <p>
        I commend unto you Phebe. — Paul here introduces Phebe to the brethren
        at Rome. Letters of recommendation were unnecessary for those who
        derived their credentials specially from the Lord, and who were
        officially well known to the churches. Paul disclaims the necessity of
        such letters for himself to the church at Corinth, though at his first
        visit he needed the introduction of Barnabas to the brethren at
        Jerusalem. There might be doubts respecting Phebe at Rome, as there were
        doubts at Jerusalem with respect to Paul, and these could not be removed
        by mere profession, unsupported by sufficient evidence, whether of her
        faith, or of his apostleship. Phebe. — This was the name of the moon,
        one of the objects of the worship of the heathens. The moon was
        reverenced by females in honor of the goddess Diana. This person
        retaining that name shows that there is no necessity to renounce names
        that have been adopted under heathenish in honor of false gods. There is
        no necessity to give other names, as Christian names. Sister. — The
        terms brother and sister, taken from human relations, are given to
        express the new and spiritual relationship which subsists among
        believers, who by a new nature have become the sons of God and the
        brethren of Christ. This shows how nearly Christians are related, and
        how affectionately they ought to love one another. If Christians be all
        really brethren and sisters, nothing should disunite them in affection.
        Which is a servant, or deaconess. — As deacons were appointed to attend
        to the poor, so deaconesses were specially set apart in the churches in
        order to attend to the wants of their own sex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh Saints, and that
        ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath,
        been a succorer of many, and of myself also. That ye receive her. — The
        purpose of Paul’s recommendation was, that Phebe should be received by
        the church. In the Lord. — That is, that they would receive her as a
        member of the body of Christ. This shows that none ought to be received
        into communion by a church but those who are considered as being in the
        Lord. It shows also that all who are in the Lord ought to be received.
        The ground of Christian fellowship is union with Christ. As becometh
        saints. — Literally, worthily of the saints; that is, in a manner worthy
        of the saints. This is usually understood as respecting the receivers, —
        ’in a manner that becomes saints to receive such persons.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But it may respect the received, and signify, ‘in a manner worthy of
        those who are received, viz., the saints.’ The latter appears to be the
        meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word worthily applies best to this reference. The saints may be poor
        and despised, but they belong to the family in heaven; they are the
        brethren of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the sons of God. They are
        therefore worthy of honorable reception by their brethren. And that ye
        assist her. — The saints are not only to receive one another into
        fellowship and to hospitality, but also they are to pay attention to
        strangers thus received, assisting them in the business which may have
        brought them to their place of residence. For she hath been a succorer
        of many. — In addition to the general claim, the Apostle enhances the
        particular claims of Phebe by a reference to her own character. She was
        a most devoted person, and had exerted herself in assisting the brethren
        in distress. Myself also. — In what way Phebe had ministered to the
        assistance of the Apostle we are not informed. But she might have many
        opportunities of relieving him, either by contributing to his support or
        ministering personally to his comfort. Here we see that, while the
        Apostle often shows the obligation of the churches and individuals to
        himself, yet he acknowledges with gratitude the services of all who
        contributed to his relief.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 3. — Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>
        Greet Priscilla and Aquila. — The sending of salutations to particular
        persons or bodies was an indication of peculiar esteem and love. This
        shows us, in the first place, that in all things not sinful we may
        comply with the customs of mankind. There is no good, but much evil, in
        singularity with respect to anything, except such things as God has
        either forbidden or required. It is only when the authority of Jesus
        interposes that we are bound to depart from the world. There will be
        sufficient opportunities of doing this without creating them for
        ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singularity in dress or in phraseology has no countenance from the word
        of God. Christians are to show sobriety in their language and in their
        dress, but in neither are they to form a fashion of their own. In the
        second place, we may learn from these salutations that it is not
        contrary to the universal love which we ought to entertain for the whole
        household of God, to have a peculiar regard for individuals. Paul
        singles out individuals from the body in general as peculiar objects of
        his attentions and remembrance. My helpers. — Paul is not ashamed to
        mention those persons, one of whom was a woman, who is here first named,
        as his helpers in the Gospel He shows no jealousy about the invasion of
        his office in their labors to spread the Gospel. To fill any office in a
        church of Christ belongs only to those whom God has appointed to it; but
        to labor in the Gospel, either publicly or privately, is not peculiar to
        any office — not even to the office of an Apostle, but belongs to every
        Christian, according to the ability conferred on him by the Head of the
        Church. Christians are in general to blame for laboring so little in the
        Lord’s service, but they can never be charged with laboring too much.
        Priscilla and Aquila are styled by the Apostle fellow-laborers in Christ
        Jesus. And there is no doubt that Jesus will acknowledge all those
        persons as such, whether male or female, whether in office or out of
        office in his churches, they have labored to make sinners acquainted
        with the Gospel of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not
        only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who have for my life laid down their own necks. — We also speak of
        venturing the neck, or laying down the head; and both idioms are
        proverbial expressions, denoting to expose to death in whatever manner
        it may take place. This expression is proverbial, and is grounded on the
        manner of taking away the life of criminals on the block. Priscilla and
        Aquila are said to have laid down their necks, not because they had done
        so literally, but because they acted in such a manner as to expose their
        lives to jeopardy. A Christian is not required to substitute himself in
        the room of another Christian who is condemned to death. For this would
        be to go beyond the requirement of the law — it would be to love our
        neighbors better than ourselves. But there may be occasions when it is
        duty to act in such a manner for the benefit of the brethren, as to
        hazard life. This we are not to decline. This is what is meant by the
        Apostle John when he says that ‘we ought to lay down our lives for the
        brethren.’ Unto whom not only I give thanks. — The devoted conduct of
        this disciple and his wife was nothing but their duty; yet Paul returns
        them thanks before all the churches, and all the world. The speculations
        of some on this subject would banish gratitude as a Christian virtue. To
        do good to the brethren is duty in all Christians, but to be thankful
        for good done is equally duty. But also all the churches of the
        Gentiles. — Though the particular instance of exemplary benevolence
        shown by Priscilla and Aquila towards the Apostle is not recorded, yet
        no doubt it was well known at the time in all the churches; and the
        whole Gentile brethren considered themselves under obligations for the
        conduct of these two devoted Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
        well-beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Achaia unto Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise greet the church that is in their house. — Besides saluting
        Priscilla and Aquila, the Apostle sends his salutation to the church
        which assembled in their house. The same expression respecting the
        church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla occurs in 1 Corinthians
        16:19. On this passage Calvin remarks: ‘It is worthy of observation,
        that Paul could not confer a more distinguished honor and ornament on
        this family, than by making mention of the church in their house. I am
        not satisfied with Erasmus’ translation congregation; for Paul
        undoubtedly made an honorable mention of the church in this passage.’
        Salute my well-beloved (rather, my beloved) Epenetus. — Paul here calls
        Epenetus his beloved. He loved all Christians; but when he styles any of
        them his beloved, it imports that they were peculiarly objects of his
        affection. But to show this, there is no need, with our version, to
        translate the word well-beloved, because the English word beloved is as
        capable as the Greek of expressing such a meaning. This is a
        distinguished honor to Epenetus. If he was the beloved of Paul, he must
        have been eminent as a servant of Christ. First-fruits. — That is, the
        first converted in the place mentioned. Such persons are called the
        first-fruits of the place, in allusion to the first fruits under the
        law. The first-fruits were offered unto God before any of the harvest
        was used, which was a setting apart of the rest to the service of man,
        and a pledge of the harvest. It is here implied to be a peculiar honor
        to be the first to believe the Gospel in any country or district. This
        honor is conferred by God in a sovereign way. This shows that, though
        all believers are equally the purchase of Christ, and that they are all
        equally washed from sin in His blood, yet that they are not all
        partakers of equal honors. Here we see, also, that Paul, instead of
        refusing to give praise to the saints on account of any distinction,
        avails himself of every opportunity to bring into notice whatever may be
        creditable to those whom he mentions. Of Achaia. — Some, on the
        authority of certain manuscripts and versions, have substituted Asia for
        Achaia. The authority, however, does not seem sufficient. The objection,
        namely, that the household of Stephanas is elsewhere said to be the
        first-fruits of Achaia, is not applicable, for Epenetus may have been
        one of that household, and in that case the passages are quite
        consistent. Besides, the change to Asia may have been adopted in the
        manuscripts and versions in order to avoid a contradiction which was
        apprehended from the common reading. Unto Christ. — That is, Epenetus
        was the first-fruits offered or presented to Christ, as the first-fruits
        under the law were presented unto God. This is a proof of the deity of
        Christ. If believers are presented as an offering to Christ, He must be
        God.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 6. — Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us.</p>
      <p>
        That is, labored much in serving us, not, according to Dr. Macknight,
        who ‘labored with us,’ in the work of the Gospel. Many women labored in
        the Gospel with the Apostle, but that is no reason for forcing this
        phrase to refer to such. Works of kindness to the Apostle were worthy of
        approbation as well as the peculiar work of disseminating the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shows that every one has a talent, and ought to exercise it in the
        service of Christ. All are not missionaries or preachers of the Gospel,
        but all may in some way assist in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my
        fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the Apostles, who also were in
        Christ before me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is true, indeed, as Dr. Macknight observes, that the Apostle ( Romans
        9:3) calls all the Jews his kinsmen; but as he here distinguishes
        individuals by this character, it is necessary to understand him as
        speaking of kindred in a more limited sense. Though every Jew was, in a
        certain sense, related to Paul, and he calls the whole nation his
        kinsmen in the sense to which he there refers, yet there would be no
        propriety in singling out individuals of the nation as related to him
        who were not so actually. Here, then, we see how desirous the Apostle is
        to express his consideration of the brethren individually, so far as was
        in his power. This also recognizes the propriety of attachment to
        kindred. Though all Christians are brethren, yet this does not interfere
        with the attachment peculiar to the relations which God Himself has
        established among men. This is of great importance, as it sets aside the
        speculations of persons who would have us believe that all relations in
        life must be absorbed by the union of believers in Christ. My
        fellow-prisoners. — When, where, or by whom this imprisonment took
        place, we have no account; yet it is not the less certain. How absurd,
        then, is it to reason, as many do, as if research were necessary, in
        order to prove what the Scriptures allege in general terms. It is a
        distinguished honor to be imprisoned for the cause of Christ. As that
        which is highly esteemed among men is abomination with God, so this,
        which is disgraceful in the eyes of men, is the highest honor before
        God. Who are of note, or distinguished. — This is another proof that,
        though all Christians are equally pardoned and equally justified, God
        acts as a sovereign in this as in everything else. Among the apostles. —
        Those persons, from their active cooperation with the Apostles, were
        well known to them and distinguished among them. Were in Christ. — To be
        in Christ is to be a Christian, to be a member of the spiritual body of
        Christ. This takes place by faith, and in the first moment of believing
        in Him. Before me. — Here priority of conversion to God is reckoned an
        honor; and Paul, instead of claiming all honors to himself, is
        solicitous to exhibit what is honorable in every man’s situation, and to
        give the preference to others whenever that preference is due. The
        Fathers, as they are called, were pious men, but often lamentably
        deficient in judgment, and generally bad reasoners. From the fact that
        these persons, Andronicus and Junia, were Christians before Paul, and
        that they were distinguished among the Apostles, Origen infers that they
        were of the number of the seventy disciples. This is a conclusion
        without premises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such conjectural reasoning imposes on many, as it has the appearance of
        giving us additional information, and containing nothing contrary to the
        Scriptures. But it affords a most mischievous precedent for perverting
        the word of God, and in no instance can it be of any service.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 8. — Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.</p>
      <p>
        This person is another of those distinguished objects of the Apostle’s
        love. Paul loved all the brethren, but for some he had a peculiar
        affection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amplias was beloved of Paul in the Lord, as a Christian, or one who was
        a member of the spiritual body of Christ. Amplias, then, as he was one
        of the peculiar objects of Paul’s love in Christ, must have been
        distinguished for his devotedness to Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul, as we have before seen, felt no jealousy of others laboring in the
        Lord, but distinguishes all of them as peculiar objects of his regard.
        They who endeavor to check the efforts of any of the disciples of
        Christ, in aiming to save sinners by communicating to them the knowledge
        of the Gospel, have a spirit very opposite to that of Paul, and are
        counteracting what he commands. It is worthy of observation, also, that
        though Paul was an inspired teacher, yet he freely distinguishes the
        humblest of those who were in any manner engaged in the work of the
        Gospel as his fellow-laborers. Stachys is one of those whom Paul honors
        with an expression of peculiar love for Christ’s sake. How unlike is the
        spirit of this Apostle from that of men who, under mistaken notions,
        regard with coldness, dislike, or jealousy the labors of those who are
        not called to office in the Church of Christ!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
        Aristobulus’ household.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apelles is here distinguished as a tried disciple. It is mentioned to
        his honor that he was tried and approved in Christ. The Lord’s people
        have various and widely diversified characteristics as Christians. The
        Apostle selects that peculiar trait in the characters of those of whom
        he writes for which they are severally distinguished. Some of them are
        tried with peculiar afflictions, and their obedience to their Lord is
        put to the severest test. When they stand this fiery trial, it is the
        most distinguished honor, and their trials in the service of Christ
        ought to be held up to notice. This is due to them from their brethren,
        and it is a great encouragement to others who are similarly tried. All
        the Lord’s people are not exposed to trials equally severe; and when the
        Lord calls any of them to glorify His name by suffering peculiarly for
        His sake, we are here taught to treat them with peculiar honor. How very
        unfounded, then, and unscriptural, are the views of those who would fear
        the encouragement of a proud legal spirit, were they to utter a word of
        praise with respect to the characters of any of the Lord’s servants.
        From perceiving an extreme on one hand, they plunge into the opposite.
        But they confound things entirely distinct. That praise which a worldly
        spirit is accustomed to seek or to give, is quite different from that
        which the Apostle confers. The latter excites to greater devotedness;
        but the former puffs up, and is quite opposed to the spirit of the
        Gospel ‘How can ye believe,’ says Christ, ‘who receive honor one of
        another?’ Such persons love the praise of men more than the praise of
        God. But the honor which is given by the Lord’s servants, after the
        example of Paul, is to the honor of the Lord, and for the interest of
        His cause. Aristobulus’ household. — Aristobulus was evidently a
        personage of great distinction, who had many domestics, of whom there
        were some who had believed the Gospel. When the head of the family
        believed, he vas usually saluted, and his household with him. When,
        therefore, salutations are sent to some of his family or slaves, and not
        to himself, there is no reason to conclude that Aristobulus was a
        believer. It is true, as Dr. Macknight suggests, he might have been
        abroad or dead, but there is no need of such suppositions where no part
        of the statement implies that he was a believer.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we see the sovereignty of God, in calling some of a family and
        leaving others in unbelief. And we may see the peculiarity of this
        sovereignty, in calling the slaves and overlooking the master. God does
        not judge as man judges. It would have been as easy for the Lord Jesus
        to have called Aristobulus as the meanest of his domestics; and human
        wisdom would have given the preference to the master. We see this
        exemplified in a thousand instances in our own day. Religious parties,
        in order to advance their interests, often select as their chief patrons
        and officers the greatest personages who will consent to give them their
        names, and even though they should be manifest enemies to the Gospel by
        wicked works. When the Lord has need of the talents of the great, the
        rich, or the learned He can convert them, and when He does convert them,
        they are a blessing for which God ought to be praised; but some persons
        choose those whom Christ has not chosen, even the enemies of Christ, for
        which they will have no praise from their Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the
        household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salute Herodion my kinsman. — This is another person that Paul
        acknowledges as a relation, thereby recognizing the affection becoming
        the natural ties of kindred. The household of Narcissus is saluted like
        that of Aristobulus. Whether this Narcissus was the distinguished
        favorite of the Emperor Claudius, the Scriptures do not determine, and
        it, therefore, can be of no importance to be ascertained. It might
        minister a question to curiosity, and thereby lead away from profitably
        considering what the Scriptures contain, in order to discover what they
        do not contain. This is a vain as well as an unprofitable way of
        spending time. Persons who indulge in it may fancy that they are
        studying and throwing light upon Scripture, but they are only covering
        God’s word with a heap of rubbish, gratifying an idle curiosity, and
        tending to draw away attention from the truths of eternal importance
        which the Scriptures reveal. Which are in the Lord. — This shows us what
        sort of persons were recognized in the first churches. They were such
        only as were believed to be in the Lord, that is, members of the
        spiritual body of Christ. It shows, also, that persons who at the time
        appeared to be Christians were considered as such without any distrust
        with respect to the reality of their faith, though with respect to some
        the fact might afterwards manifest the contrary. Man judges by evidence,
        and is warranted to proceed with confidence upon that evidence, though
        the Searcher of hearts may see the profession to be without the true
        knowledge of God, or change of heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        This explains the passage in Ezekiel with respect to the righteous
        turning away from his righteousness; and the passage in Hebrews, ‘If any
        man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.
      </p>

        Ver. 12. — Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute
        the beloved Persis, which labored much in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa who labor in the Lord. — These were women
        who labored in the Gospel This shows that, while women are excluded from
        speaking in the church, they are not excluded from laboring in the
        Gospel. The Lord has not only permitted women to labor in the Gospel,
        but He has, both in the apostolic and in the present time, singularly
        blessed their labors. Beloved Persis. — She was another woman who
        employed herself in the service of the Gospel, and is peculiarly
        distinguished as laboring much in the Lord. Even among the faithful
        servants of the Lord there is a difference of activity in His service,
        and the servant who labors much is peculiarly noticed by Paul. As,
        however, all the good deeds of the Lord’s people are done only by the
        influence of His spirit, none have in themselves ground of boasting.

        Ver. 13. — Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        All believers are chosen of God. When Rufus is distinguished as the
        chosen, he must have furnished distinguished evidence of his election.
        He was chosen in the Lord, for none are elected but in Christ. Their
        election is without regard to merit in themselves: they are chosen in
        Christ. His mother and mine. — The word mother seems to be used in its
        proper signification in respect to Rufus, and figuratively in its
        application to Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a high honor to be so distinguished by the Apostle. This person,
        it appears, had behaved to the Apostle with the kindness, affection, and
        tenderness of a mother. This inculcates kindness and attention on the
        part of Christians towards those who are devotedly laboring in the
        service of Christ. It may, indeed, be a matter of lamentation that there
        are few like this woman; but it is equally a matter of lamentation that
        there are so few believers who manifest that devotedness which was
        constantly exhibited by Paul When the laborers in Christ’s vineyard make
        no sacrifice, they should not expect what is due only to signal
        devotedness and disinterestedness.
      </p>

        Ver. 14. — Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Pacrobas, Hermes, and the
        brethren which are with them.

        Ver. 15. — Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
        Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here a number of brethren are selected without distinction. This mark of
        brotherly attention would gratify those whom the Apostle here names,
        besides the brethren who were with them. The lord’s people are not
        equally distinguished, but they are all brethren equally related to Him
        who is the Elder Brother of His people. Some of them are eminent, and
        others are without peculiar distinction. They are all, however, worthy
        of love. A church is not to consist of the most eminent believers, but
        of believers, though some be of the lowest attainments. A church of
        Christ is a school in which their education is to be perfected. And all
        the saints which are with them. — That is, the believers in their
        families and neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        These might not be personally known to the Apostle, but as believers
        they were worthy of his notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might at first sight appear strange that in an inspired letter, which
        was to be preserved to the end of the world for the edification and
        instruction of the churches, there should be so much of it taken up with
        what many might consider as useless ceremony. But as the Apostle was
        inspired by the Spirit of God in this, no well as in the highest
        matters, it is evident that we ought to look for instruction from this
        peculiarity of his writings. This shows the value of inspiration; for
        were these writings merely human, we should not look for instruction
        from such things. It shows us that every attention that expresses and
        promotes love ought to be exhibited among Christians, who should employ
        the forms and courtesies of social life that manifest respect in order
        to show their esteem and affection for one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
        salute you.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the salutations sent to the brethren, Paul passes to the injunction
        of a form of salutation to the used among those to whom he wrote. He
        enjoins them to salute one another with a holy kiss. He calls it a holy
        kiss as distinguished not only from that which is sinful, but also from
        the kiss that merely expresses common affection. The latter was proper
        in itself as an expression of kindness among relations or friends; but
        this is grounded on the love that Christians should have for one
        another, and is a holy kiss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much ridicule has been cast on this practice. But it was enjoined on the
        churches by the Apostles. It is again and again repeated, and was
        practiced by all the primitive churches. Peter calls it a kiss of love.
        Justin Martyr, in giving an account of the weekly assemblies of the
        Christians of the second century, says, ‘We mutually salute one another
        by a kiss, and then we bring forward the bread and the cup.’ And the
        form is still maintained by the Church of Rome in what they call the
        osculum pacis. The churches of Christ salute you. — Not only did
        individuals send salutations to churches or individuals with whom they
        had a personal acquaintance, but whole churches sent salutations to one
        another in consideration of their common union in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
        and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I beseech you, brethren. — The churches of Christ have here the most
        solemn injunction given, in the most earnest manner, with respect to a
        thing to which at one time or other they will all be found obnoxious.
        They are warned against the artful attempts of dangerous hypocrites,
        who, for sinister and interested purposes, endeavor to make divisions in
        the churches with which they are united. The injunction does not respect
        the conscientious errors of good men, but the plausible efforts of men
        who, under the mask of religion, are serving themselves. There is no
        essential difference, whether the divisions are internal or external —
        whether they are merely calculated to distract the body to which they
        belong — or whether they tend to schism or separation in fellowship.
        Indeed, the most dangerous and mischievous divisions are those which do
        not call for separation. They eat like a gangrene; and their authors
        should not be tolerated. Every Christian may profess and follow his own
        views of the will of his Master without exciting any division in the
        body of Christ; and even when he is called to separate, to maintain his
        fidelity to his Lord, this is not dividing the body of Christ, but the
        most effectual way to promote its union. The motive is not
        self-interest, or pride; but obedience to the will of God. Contrary to
        the doctrine which ye have learned. — The force of the passage lies in
        this sentence. The factious persons, against whom the Apostle here warns
        the church to which he writes, are to be watched and guarded against.
        Their motives are bad, and their efforts are contrary to the Gospel and
        the doctrine which the Church had already learned; for the Gospel
        teaches unity among all who believe in the Savior. They are all one, as
        united in Christ, the head of the body. Such persons are to be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men who, from a view of exalting themselves, endeavor to sow division in
        the Church, are more to be shunned than if they were infected with
        pestilence; and the brethren who are connected with them ought not, from
        their confidence in their own steadfastness, to expose themselves to
        their conversation on such subjects. Such persons are in the service of
        Satan, who will prevail to deceive the strongest of the people of God,
        if he obtains permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
        their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts
        of the simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Persons of this description serve not our Lord Jesus Christ. — To serve
        Christ is their profession; and this profession they may render
        plausible, but with all its plausibility it is a false profession. They
        are not doing the Lord’s work, for they are disuniting those whom Jesus
        has united. Instead of serving the Lord, they have a design of making
        gain by this conduct, which is equally to be condemned, whether they are
        led by vanity or ambition, or any other selfish motive not sanctioned by
        the word of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        No injunction ought to be attended to with more vigilance than this. The
        evil that is here condemned in the persons denounced by the Apostle is
        more dangerous than the open profligacy of those who turn away from the
        truth. No one could be deceived by the openly profane; but the
        hypocritical professions of such factious persons is calculated to
        injure or to destroy the Church of Christ, under the cloak of religion.
        And by good words and fair speeches. — Here the Apostle points out the
        means which those wicked persons employ to give them success. They use
        good words and fair speeches. Their soothing address is the bait by
        which Satan teaches them to ensnare the brethren. Accordingly, the
        Apostle says that in this manner they deceive the hearts of the simple.
        The authors of heresies have, in general, been remarkable for a winning
        manner and seductive address; and thus some of the Lord’s people may at
        least for a time be entangled in their snares. It is quite obvious that
        the injunction here given is not designed to discountenance Christians
        from denouncing any error or corruption that may have obtained place
        among His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The persons against whom the Apostle warns us are those who, for their
        own interest or selfish purposes, excite divisions among the brethren.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calvin observes, ‘To separate such as agree in the truth of Christ is an
        impious and sacrilegious divorce; but to defend a conspiracy for
        promoting lies and impious doctrines, under the pretext of peace and
        unity, is a shameless calumny. The Papists have no foundation for
        exciting, by artful guile, an unfavorable impression and low opinion of
        us believers from this passage, for we do not attack and confute the
        Gospel of Christ, but the falsehoods of the devil by which it has
        hitherto been obscured.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
        therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which
        is good, and simple concerning evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. — The Apostle intimates
        here that he gave the believers at Rome these warnings, not from any
        peculiar jealousy with respect to their liability to err; on the
        contrary, he praises them for their ready obedience to the will of God
        as delineated by his Epistles. Obedience here may indeed respect their
        reception of the Gospel, which was a matter much spoken of, but it is
        not to be confined to this. It will apply to their readiness in
        receiving everything taught by the authority of God. The same authority
        that requires obedience to the Gospel, requires also obedience to every
        ordinance and precept. It is the greatest praise to any church or
        individual to obey cheerfully, with a childlike disposition, whatever
        the word of God teaches. Many Christians are not teachable, and while
        they have obeyed the Gospel to salvation, yet use their own wisdom in
        many other things respecting the institutions of God. They employ subtle
        and plausible reasonings, by which they impose on themselves and deceive
        others. This in the end will procure them neither honor nor profit. It
        will at last be found that he who submits most unreservedly to every
        tittle of the Divine injunctions, has been the wisest man. Blessed shall
        that servant be, who, when his Lord comes, shall be found doing His will
        fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obedience of the Roman Christians had been published most
        extensively; and this notice of the fact shows that it is important that
        the disciples should publicly make a profession of the Gospel, and of
        every commandment of the Lord. They should not be ashamed either of Him
        or of His word. They should boldly profess faith in His revealed
        character in every part of it, and of His ordinances and precepts even
        in the things most offensive to the world. This is to the honor of their
        Lord, and is designed as a testimony to men. Christians are not at
        liberty to decline obedience to anything that the Lord has appointed,
        out of fear of the reproach of the world. On the contrary, they are to
        hold forth before all men everything that God hath commanded. This is
        different from ostentation. To attend to any religious appointment to be
        seen of men, is the vilest hypocrisy. But to hold forth the will of God
        in things that the world hates, is true Christian obedience. I am glad
        therefore on your behalf — So far from suspecting the obedience of the
        brethren at Rome, the Apostle rejoiced concerning them. It was the
        greatest pleasure to him to hear of their obedience so extensively
        published. All Christians should imitate the Apostle in this joy. It
        should be matter of rejoicing to them to hear of believers in every part
        of the world fully obeying Christ. The disposition which the Apostle
        here manifests, and of which alone the Lord will approve, is a joy in
        hearing of Christ being honored, and the people of Christ advanced in
        devotedness to His will. We ought to be zealous for every part of our
        belief with respect to the will of God. But we should be on our guard
        lest this should arise from any selfish motive, and not solely from love
        to Christ and Christ’s people. Christ cannot be honored, and His people
        cannot be profited, when they practice the inventions of men as the
        appointments of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it is hurtful to believers, as well as injurious to the honor of
        Christ, when His people decline conformity to any part of His will,
        either from disaffection to it, or from a desire to avoid the offense of
        the cross. But yet I would have you wise unto that which is good. — This
        is the reason why he warned them against the authors of division. The
        Apostle wished them to be wise with respect to that which is good. They
        ought not only to understand the doctrines and ordinances of Christ, but
        also to be aware of the fact that even in the churches of Christ there
        would from time to time arise deceivers to lead away the simple. Had
        they not been warned of this, they might be ready to think that no evil
        person could ever be found among the disciples, who would thereby be
        liable to be ensnared by crafty men. Simple concerning evil — Simple
        here appears to mean not merely pure, as Dr. Macknight translates it,
        but simple as opposed to wise. The two words are here evidently
        contrasted. As to evil, the Apostle wishes the Christians to be without
        cunning, or dexterity, or skill. In this, it was his desire that they
        should be quite unknowing and unpracticed in the ways of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
        shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the God of peace. — After the exhortation which the Apostle had just
        given to the saints at Rome to maintain peace among themselves, he here
        designates their heavenly Father, as in the conclusion of the preceding
        chapter, the God of peace. God is the God of peace, because He it is
        that is the author of all the peace that His people enjoy. Were it not
        for the overruling power of the Lord, His people would have no rest at
        any time in this world. But the Lord Jesus rules in the midst of His
        enemies, and He gives His people peace in the midst of their enemies.
        This shows us that we ought constantly to look to God for this peace. If
        we seek it not, but grow self-confident and secure, dangers and troubles
        may arise from every quarter. Our only security is God, and our duty is
        constantly to ask peace of Him in the midst of a world of trouble. God
        gives His people different gifts; but peace is a blessing which they all
        need, and without which they can have no happiness. We ought, therefore,
        constantly to pray for peace to God’s people all over the world. We
        ought to pray for the peace of Jerusalem as our chief joy. Instead of
        thinking it strange that unbelievers should disturb us, or that Satan
        should stir up confusion even among Christians, it is owing to almighty
        power that His people have any peace on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in the churches there would be no peace, were it not for God’s
        presence. Such is the cunning of Satan, and the remaining ignorance and
        corruption of the Lord’s people, that Satan would keep them in continual
        broils, if God did not powerfully counteract him. God is here called the
        God of peace, with a peculiar reference to the factious persons against
        whom the believers were warned in the preceding connection. The
        emissaries of Satan strive to distract the churches; but God — the God
        of peace — counteracts their wicked designs. When it is considered that
        there is so much remaining evil in the best of children of God, it is
        amazing that they ever have peace. But it is the presence of God that
        gives them any degree of peace Were it not for this, no church could
        continue one day in peace. Shall bruise Satan under your feet. — Christ,
        the seed of the woman, bruised the head of the serpent, and His people
        will, through Christ, bruise Satan likewise. The word Satan signifies
        adversary. The term Devil means calumniator or accuser. He accuses the
        brethren before God day and night.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is called Leviathan , the Serpent , the great Dragon , the old
        Serpent , the Tempter , Beelzebub , a Murderer , a Liar , Prince of this
        world, Ruler of darkness, God of this world, Prince of the power of air,
        Belial, the Angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue
        is Abaddon , but in Greek hath his name Apollyon , that is destroyer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here encourages the believers to sustain the combat against
        Satan, their mortal enemy, who does everything in his power to disturb
        their peace, and to tempt them to all evil. There were two victories to
        be obtained over Satan. By the first, his head was to be bruised under
        the feet of Jesus Christ; and by the second, the rest of his body will
        be bruised under the feet of the believers. Of the second of these
        victories, Paul here speaks. In the first prediction, God speaks as the
        Lord of Hosts, the God of war — ’I will put enmity.’ The war continues
        till the bruising of Satan’s head has taken place, and his empire is
        overthrown; and when it is subverted, peace is made, and God is the God
        of peace . As, then, the seed of the woman has bruised the head of the
        serpent, so His people will through Christ likewise bruise Satan. The
        Apostle says not we shall bruise him under our feet, but God shall do
        it; yet he says not He shall bruise him under His own feet, but under
        yours. The victory shall be ours, though wrought by Him; and He shall do
        it shortly. The God of peace shall subdue that grand disturber of our
        peace, and shall give us perfect victory, and after it endless peace; He
        shall free us of this trouble and molestation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not, then, in our own power that we must encounter this adversary;
        it is God who bruises him under our feet. ‘We wrestle not against flesh
        and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
        rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
        high places;’ and it is only when covered with the armor of God and by
        His power that we can overcome enemies so formidable. Dr. Macknight says
        of the word Satan, that ‘Here it is given to the unbelieving Jews, and
        also to the Judaizing teachers and their adherents, who, for selfish
        purposes, bred divisions at Rome, ver. 17, and in every church where
        they could obtain a footing; they are therefore called ministers of
        Satan’ 2 Corinthians 11:15, etc. But it is of Satan himself that the
        Apostle speaks. Though Satan works by his instruments are crushed, he is
        crushed. Paul wrote this Epistle, and Tertius wrote it, — the one as
        dictating, the other as amanuensis. But when Paul is said to write the
        Epistle, we are not to say that Paul means Tertius. Satan works
        personally in disturbing the churches, though his work is carried on
        through the instrumentality of men. He excites his emissaries and
        suggests his devices to them, and they are successful through his
        artifices. Shortly. — Some understand this of the final victory that all
        the Lord’s people will obtain at last over Satan and all his emissaries.
        But though they will not be free from the attacks of this subtle
        adversary as long as they are in the body, yet from the phrase
        ‘speedily,’ or ‘shortly,’ no well as from the immediate reference to the
        power of God in the Church, it appears rather to refer to a present
        victory. The meaning, then, is, that all the churches of Christ are to
        be hurt by factious people rising up among them, emissaries of Satan,
        under the cover of religion; and if the Church is not led away by the
        error of Satan, God, as the God of peace, will shortly deliver them from
        the malignant influence of this apostate spirit. Satan will not be
        permitted to harass them continually. It is consistent with God’s wisdom
        to permit Satan to try His people; but when they are sufficiently tried,
        they are delivered from the temptation. So it was with the Son of God
        Himself. Satan was for a time permitted to harass Him, but at last he
        was dismissed. In like manner, churches and individual Christians are
        all to be tried in various ways; but if they abide the trial, they shall
        be delivered from the temptation, and, in the most emphatic and
        extensive sense, they shall all at last bruise Satan under their feet.
        They shall obtain a complete victory over him in the day of the
        appearing of their almighty Lord, who will then finally consign him to
        his awful punishment, and cast him into the lake of fire and brimstone.
        On that day the full import of this expression will be seen. The grace
        of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. — This form of expression has
        always been understood to import the deity of Jesus Christ, and justly
        it has been so understood. It is essentially and necessarily a prayer to
        our Lord Jesus Christ; and if He is not God, what grace has He to bestow
        on His people? ‘My grace,’ said He to Paul when praying to Him, ‘is
        sufficient for thee; for My strength is made perfect in weakness.’ It
        implies that there is a constant supply of grace to be communicated from
        Christ to His people; and if Christ so communicates His holy influences
        to His people in all ages, in all countries, to every individual of
        them, at every instant of time, what can He be but the almighty God?
        This implies that they who have been bought by the blood of Christ are
        to be supplied with grace by Him continually, in order to their standing
        in the truth. All their perseverance is in virtue of this. Of His Church
        it is said, ‘I, the Lord, do keep it; I will water it every moment; lest
        any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.’

        Ver. 21. — Timotheus my work-fellow, and Lucius, and Jason , and
        Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Timothy was a most devoted servant of the Lord Jesus, more of the same
        spirit with Paul than any of his other fellow-laborers. The Apostle,
        instead of designating himself by the superiority of his office with
        reference to that of Timothy, calls him his work-fellow. How different
        is this from the conduct of those who seek earthly honors and
        distinctions as the servants of Christ! All Christians are not alike
        obedient, and therefore not all equally honored before God; but their
        honor will be revealed in another world, though not in this. The other
        persons mentioned in this salutation were the kinsmen of the Apostle,
        whom he thus honorably recognizes as his relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — I Tertius, who wrote this Epistle, salute you in the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle generally employed an amanuensis to write what he dictated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tertius wrote the Epistle, but it was in all things communicated by
        Paul, as what Paul communicated was dictated to him by the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tertius likewise salutes the brethren. In the Lord. — These salutations
        were not those of mere worldly acquaintance or friendship, but in the
        Lord, that is, as a member of the body of Christ of which they were
        members. He might have no acquaintance with any individual among them,
        yet he was full of affection to them as a Christian brother. That
        conformity to the world which the Scriptures condemn, is a conformity to
        things contrary to the law of God. All the innocent customs of society
        may be imitated by Christ’s people without any sin. As the people of the
        world are accustomed to express good will by their salutations, so the
        Lord’s people ought likewise to show their love by similar expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love ought not only to exist in the heart, but also ought, on proper
        occasions, to be outwardly expressed. Without this it cannot edify or
        console those who are its objects. The people of the Lord, then, ought
        to recognize one another, and express their mutual love in all those
        ways usual among men.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 23. — Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you.</p>
      <p>
        Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaius was distinguished for Christian hospitality. The Apostle abode in
        his house at the time of writing this Epistle; but his hospitality was
        of the most liberal and extensive kind. He is praised by the Apostle as
        the host of the whole church. Gaius also sent his salutations to the
        church at Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Christianity does not destroy the different orders in society, all
        Christians are brethren, and recognize each other as such, though of
        different nations and of different ranks. Erastus the chamberlain of the
        city. — This is another personage of distinction who sends his
        salutation to the brethren at Rome. He held an important office in the
        city where he lived. The Apostle designates him as chamberlain, which
        might correspond in a good measure to treasurer. But in such cases in
        most instances no word in one language can be found to correspond
        perfectly to that of another, because no two countries may have the same
        modification of offices. The notice of the office of Erastus, although
        in itself it may appear trifling, is in reality of great importance. It
        shows us that Christians may hold offices even under heathen
        governments, and that to serve Christ we are not to be abstracted from
        worldly business. Quartus a brother. — The Apostle having no peculiar
        distinction to notice in this person, calls him a brother. This was a
        common name for all believers, because they are all brethren in Christ.
        It may at first sight appear superfluous to designate this person by a
        characteristic belonging to all Christians. But though it belongs to all
        Christians, yet it is not endlessly expressed. The Apostle directs
        attention to this circumstance that they are brethren, and that it is a
        real and important relation. We may know that all Christians are
        brethren, but it is nevertheless useful to be reminded of this, as we
        may be prone to act towards them in an unbrotherly manner.

      <p>
        Ver. 24. — The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This important prayer is repeated from ver. 20, which shows us that all
        repetition is not vain repetition, but that it may mark a thing of
        peculiar importance. Three times did our Lord employ the same words in
        His prayer in Gethsemane. And the Apostle, from the abundance of his
        heart, and his great concern for the Christians at Rome, here within a
        short compass twice prays that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ might
        be with them. Indeed, there is great need of such earnest petitions, for
        without the constant supply of the grace of Christ we could not abide in
        Him. Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight observes that in the Syriac version this benediction is
        omitted at the 24th verse, and added at the end of the Epistle. But this
        has the appearance of human wisdom correcting the language of the Holy
        Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 25. — Now to Him that is of power to establish you according to my
        Gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation
        of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now to Him that is of power to establish you. — From this we learn that
        establishment in the faith is not of ourselves, but of God. It requires
        the power of Jehovah to establish His people in the truth. So far from
        being able to bring themselves into the faith of the Gospel, they are
        not able to continue in it without God. What blindness, then, is it to
        boast of the power of man to believe and to keep himself in the truth!
        Power to do anything in the service of God must be communicated from
        above. According to my Gospel. — Here we see in what a Christian is to
        be established, namely, in the faith according to the Gospel. Men may be
        established in error, they may die for human traditions, and have a zeal
        of God, but not according to knowledge; but this is of no value. Paul
        calls the Gospel his Gospel, to intimate that different doctrines would
        be preached by false teachers as the Gospel. But all other gospels,
        except that of Paul and the other Apostles, are false. Believers must be
        established in Paul’s Gospel. How many other gospels are now preached as
        the Gospel of Christ! yet none of them can avail for the salvation of
        the soul. And the preaching of Jesus Christ — This phrase is not the
        mere repetition of the same thing. It is indeed the same truth, but in a
        different point of view. In the one it is considered as the Gospel or
        good news, and this according to the doctrine of Paul. In the other it
        is considered as the publication of the truth about Jesus Christ. We are
        to be established according to what the Apostles preached concerning
        Jesus Christ. Believers have nothing to do with the vain speculations
        and opinions of men about the way of salvation. They must believe, and
        ought to be confirmed, in the truth, according as it was originally
        preached by the Apostles. The preaching of the Gospel is called
        preaching Jesus Christ, Acts 5:42, who is the subject of the Gospel.
        According to the revelation of the mystery . — This is another view of
        the same truth, but not a mere synonymous expression. The Gospel is here
        considered as the revelation of a mystery. It was couched in dark
        figures under the Old Testament dispensation, but is now developed by
        the Apostles of the Lord. It is first considered as the Gospel, or good
        news, characterized as the Gospel of Paul; secondly as the doctrine
        preached concerning Jesus Christ by those whom He had inspired to reveal
        and publish it; and, lastly, it is considered as a mystery revealed. In
        this there is no tautology. It is designed to present the same thing in
        several different aspects. The word mystery here refers, not, as Dr.
        Macknight and many others suppose, to the calling of the Gentiles, but
        to the Gospel itself, which was obscurely revealed in the Old Testament.
        Calvin, without sufficient ground, states this as a difficulty but in
        reality there is no difficulty in it. ‘In what sense,’ he says, ‘Paul
        calls the Gospel a hidden mystery in this passage, in Ephesians 3:9, and
        Colossians 1:26, is not fully determined even among the learned. The
        opinion of those who refer it to the calling in of the Gentiles, is the
        most forcible, to which Paul himself expressly alludes in his Epistle to
        the Colossians. I grant this to be one, but not the sole cause; for I
        think there is a greater probability in supposing Paul to have regarded
        other points of difference between the Old and New Testament.’ All these
        passages use the word mystery with the same reference: none of them
        represent the calling of the Gentiles to be the mystery, or the reason
        why the Gospel was called a mystery. It is the Gospel itself which is
        called a mystery in Ephesians 3:9. The thing hid in God from the
        beginning of the world, was the plan of salvation through the death of
        His Son; and the revelation of it by Christ and His Apostles, was making
        known the manifold wisdom of God in the redemption of His people. In
        Colossians 1:26, it is the Gospel as the word of God that is the
        mystery. In ver. 27, this mystery is said, by the preaching of the
        Gospel, to be made known among the Gentiles, just as in the verse before
        us. The calling of the Gentiles is not called a mystery. Kept secret
        since the world began, or, in eternal times; that is, in all preceding
        eternity. — The common version very well expresses the meaning. The
        translation of Dr. Macknight, ‘the times of the ages,’ is an uncouth
        expression, and founded on views which, as stated by him, are quite
        fanciful. The mystery kept secret was the hidden sense of the Old
        Testament dispensation, which all pointed to the kingdom of God, but
        still left it concealed under various historical, prophetical, and
        typical representations The whole of the Old Testament, indicating the
        truth which is revealed in the New, may properly be termed a parable,
        the meaning of which is, that it conveys information embodied in an
        action designed to represent some truth called the moral, or mystery.
        This method of parabolical instruction, Jesus Christ Himself, as had
        been predicted, Psalm 78:2, Matthew 13:35, adopted towards the
        multitude, concealing under it the mysteries to which He referred. When
        ‘His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?’ ‘He said,
        Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to
        others in parables, that seeing they might not see, and hearing they
        might not understand.’ Thus the mystery, or concealed sense of what He
        said, was kept secret from them. It is to the Old Testament, taken as a
        whole, that our Lord seems to refer when He says, ‘Know ye not this
        parable, and how then will ye know all parables?’ Ver. 26. — But now is
        made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets according to the
        commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the
        obedience of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now is made manifest. — Mr. Stuart construes the words translated
        ‘the scriptures of the Prophets’ with ‘made manifest,’ and translates
        thus: ‘But is now revealed by the scriptures of the Prophets, according
        to the commandment of the eternal God.’ But these words, ‘the scriptures
        of the Prophets,’ are evidently to be construed with ‘made known.’ He
        observes that ‘the Apostle refers to the most ancient times, before any
        revelation was given, as the cro >noi aijw >nioi next to the Messianic
        prophecies contained in the Old Testament.’ But this is a forced view.
        In the text there is no appearance of dividing the times of the Old
        Testament dispensation from ancient times. All the times preceding
        Christ are included in the words translated in our version, ‘since the
        world began,’ and by Mr. Stuart, ‘ancient ages.’ The revelation of the
        Messiah in the Old Testament could not be spoken of as now revealed.
        There was now a new revelation. In the time of the Old Testament, the
        mystery of the Messiah was couched in figure and in prophecy. The
        Messiah, indeed, was in a certain degree discovered by Moses and the
        Prophets, but He was not made manifest. This was done when He Himself
        appeared. The mystery of Christ and of the Gospel is always spoken of in
        the New Testament as being manifested then, and not in the former
        dispensation. In the same manner, although the bringing in of the
        ‘everlasting righteousness,’ namely, the righteousness of God, Romans
        1:17, was predicted by the Prophet Daniel 9:24, and so often made
        mention of by Isaiah, yet Isaiah speaks of it as not yet revealed or
        made manifest but as shortly to be so. ‘Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye
        judgment, and do justice: for My salvation is near to come, and My
        righteousness to be revealed,’ Isaiah 56:50: And in accordance with
        this, Paul, in this Epistle, ch. 1:17, and 3:21, declares that now it is
        revealed. ‘But now the righteousness of God without the law is
        manifested, being witnessed by the law and the Prophets.’ This
        corresponds with what the Apostle here announces respecting the
        manifestation of the mystery of the Gospel. Until the Sun of
        Righteousness arose, all the testimonies of the Prophets were as ‘a
        light that shineth in a dark place,’ 2 Peter 1:19; but they came to be
        plainly confirmed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath
        abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the
        Gospel. And by the scriptures of the Prophets made known to all nations.
        — Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight justly construes these words, not with the words ‘made
        manifest,’ like Mr. Stuart, but with ‘made known.’ But as, probably, it
        did not appear to him obvious how the mystery was now made known by the
        scriptures of the Prophets, he uses violence to evade this sense of the
        expression. He makes a transposition in translating the words which is
        not justifiable, and renders the passage thus: ‘But is now made
        manifest, and by the command of the eternal God, in the prophetic
        writings, is made known to all the Gentiles, in order to the obedience
        of faith.’ This not only deranges the order of the Apostle’s words, but
        also gives a translation that is not warrant able. He renders the phrase
        not through or by the Scriptures, but ‘in the Scriptures.’ This bends
        the words of the Apostle to a supposed meaning. But whatever difficulty
        may appear in the affirmation that the mystery is now made known by the
        writings of the Prophets, yet as this is what the Apostle has said, our
        duty is to search for its signification, and not arbitrarily to force
        out the words a translation which is unnatural. The meaning appears to
        be, that by the fulfillment of the prophetical writings which had now
        taken place, such a light was thrown on these writings, that by them the
        mystery, which was in perfect consistency with their representations,
        was made known. In the same way the Apostle Peter, besides referring to
        the voice from heaven, which was heard by him and the other Apostles on
        the holy mount, appeals to the word of prophecy, not as ‘more sure,’ — a
        sense which would be degrading to the apostolic testimony, than which
        nothing can be more sure, — but as made more firm, or confirmed by its
        accomplishment. The revelation now made of the mystery of Christ and of
        the Gospel, by the Apostle, was through the prophetical writings,
        inasmuch as, though he was as fully inspired as the Prophets themselves,
        he proved his doctrines by the Scriptures, and pointed to them as
        containing in prediction what was now accomplished. This is a
        characteristic feature in the teaching of the Apostles — a feature which
        to many has appeared strange. In the same way as Paul here declares that
        the mystery was made known by the scriptures of the Prophets, Peter
        affirms that the Prophets prophesied of the- grace that should come to
        us. According to the commandment. — The publication of the Gospel was by
        God’s special command, and by the injunction of God it was to be made
        known to all nations. Thus the interest of the Gentiles in the salvation
        of the Gospel is made to rest on the direct authority of God. The Jews
        were prone to consider the blessings of the Messiah as confined to
        themselves; but they had no warrant, or even plausible pretext, for this
        error, in their own Scriptures. Of the everlasting God, or eternal God.
        — God is distinguished from all besides as eternal. All other objects
        that have been worshipped, and all other beings, had a beginning. God is
        without beginning as well as without end. For the obedience of faith. —
        That is, to be believed; for to believe is to obey the Gospel. The
        command of the Gospel is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Every one
        who believes in Him obeys the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 27. — To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>
        To God only wise. — There are three different ways in which the words in
        the original are translated. God only wise, according to our version;
        or, the only wise God; or, the wise God alone. Between the first and the
        second there is only this difference, that the one represents God as the
        only wise being, and the other as the only wise God. Dr. Macknight’s
        objections to the common version, and his reasons for the adoption of
        the third translation, do not seem convincing. When God is called the
        only wise God, it may not imply, as he alleges, that there are some gods
        who are not wise, but that the character of God, as exhibited in the
        Scriptures, is the only character that ascribes wisdom in proportion to
        God. The gods of the heathen are not wise. The God of the Deist is not
        wise. The God of the Arian is not wise. No view ever given of the Divine
        character exhibits the infinite wisdom of God in redemption, but that
        which is found it the Gospel. The expression, ‘God only wise,’ does not
        imply, as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight again alleges, that God possesses no perfection but wisdom. It
        means that God is the only wise being. Yet John, 17:3, where the word
        rendered God is similarly situated, seems to favor the second mode of
        translating the words, as in 1 Timothy 1:17; Jude 25. Be glory through
        Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. — All the glory that will redound to God
        through the ages of eternity, from the salvation of sinners, proceeds
        through Jesus Christ. Through Him it is manifested. It is through Jesus
        Christ that we ought to ascribe to God the glory. In Jesus Christ all
        things are united which are in heaven and which are on earth, — not only
        saints, but angels. Christ is ‘the power of God, and the wisdom of God.’
        ‘God hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of
        the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.’ All this shows that Jesus
        Christ is God, for Christ’s work is the glory of the Father, because He
        is one with Him. In the same way Jude concludes his Epistle — ’To the
        only wise God, our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and powerful
        both now and ever. Amen.’
