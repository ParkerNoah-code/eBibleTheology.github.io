      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 13. — For the promise, that he should be the heir of the word, was
        not to Abraham, or to his seed, through law, but through the
        righteousness of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here continues to prove that the blessing of justification is
        received through faith, and not in any other way. Heir of the world —
        The promise to Abraham included three things, — 1. That the promised
        seed of the woman should descend from him; 2. That all nations should be
        blessed in that seed; 3. That, as a pledge of all this, he and his seed
        should inherit the land of Canaan. ‘And I will give unto thee, and to
        thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land
        of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.’ Canaan, however, was but an
        emblem of the heavenly country, of which last only Abraham could have an
        everlasting possession; for he was a stranger on the earth, and Canaan
        was to him ‘a strange country,’ Hebrews 11:9.
      </p>
      <p>
        This he understood it to be, and accordingly to the former he looked
        forward as what was substantially promised, Hebrews 11:13,16. This was
        ‘that world,’ as it is designated by our Lord, Luke 20:35, — a
        possession so often called an inheritance, Hebrews 9:15; 1 Peter 1:4, of
        which not only Abraham, but also his spiritual posterity, were
        constituted heirs. They were to inherit all things, Revelation 21:7; and
        although the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain, yet all
        things are theirs, 1 Corinthians 3:21-23. Abraham, however, being the
        father or first heir according to that promise, he might properly, by
        way of distinction, be called ‘the heir,’ and on the same ground, the
        father of many nations, being the father of all God’s people; as is
        likewise promised in the covenant, which is so often referred to in this
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The expression ‘heir’ has a manifest relation to the title of children,
        which is given to the people of God in their adoption. It is on this
        account that Paul joins them together, — ’If children, then heirs, heirs
        of God, and joint heirs with Christ,’ Romans 8:17; by which he teaches
        that they have not only a right to the good things that God confers, but
        that they have right in virtue of their adoption, and not of their
        works. The birthright of a child, which gives him a right to the good
        things of his father, and distinguishes him from those who may gain them
        by their services, resembles the privilege conferred by the free and
        gratuitous adoption of God of His children. In conferring the right in
        this way, every pretension to merit is excluded; and as God, in the law,
        had rendered inheritances inalienable, such also is the inviolable
        stability of the inheritance which God confers. The grandeur of this
        inheritance is represented in Scripture by the appellations of a
        kingdom, Luke 12:32; of a crown, 2 Timothy 4:8; and of a throne,
        Revelation 3:21. Or to his seed — The covenant, in all its promises, and
        in its fullest extent, in reference to spiritual blessings, was
        established in Christ, who was emphatically and eminently Abraham’s
        seed, Galatians 3:16; and in Him, with all His members, who are the
        spiritual seed of Abraham, of whom the natural seed were typical, as the
        land of Canaan was typical of the heavenly inheritance. The promise to
        the seed was, that all nations should be blessed in Him, and this
        promise was made to Abraham also, as it implied that the Messiah was to
        be Abraham’s seed. The promise to Christ included all the children that
        God had given Him, who are in Him, and one with Him. These are all
        ‘joint heirs with Jesus Christ,’ Romans 8:17.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many are spoken of before Abraham as the children of God; but we do not
        read that the first promise respecting the seed, Genesis 3, was repeated
        to any of them. Though, in the time of Enos, men began to call
        themselves by the name of the Lord; though Enoch walked with God; though
        Noah was an heir of the righteousness which is by faith; though Jehovah
        was the God of Shem — it is not said that the promise of the seed was
        renewed to them. But to Abraham it was expressly renewed; and hence we
        see the reason why he is so frequently alluded to in the New Testament,
        and spoken of as the father of believers. Through the law. — Literally
        through law without the article. The Apostle had shown above that the
        blessing of righteousness came upon Abraham before he was circumcised,
        and here he shows that the promise that he should be the heir of the
        world was not made to him on account of any works of law, but through
        the righteousness received by faith. In this way Paul follows out his
        argument in proof that justification and the blessings connected with it
        were not the consequence either of circumcision or of personal
        obedience, but were received through faith. But through the
        righteousness of faith. — The righteousness of faith is an elliptical
        expression, meaning the righteousness which is received by faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the only way in which the promise, in order to prove effectual,
        could be given. ‘If there had been a law given which could have given
        life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the
        Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of
        Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.’ It was therefore to
        receive its accomplishment only by virtue of, and through the
        communication of, the righteousness received by faith. This is that
        righteousness which was counted or imputed to Abraham, when, upon the
        promise being made to him of a numerous seed, he believed in the Lord,
        Genesis 15:6. The inheritance comes solely in virtue of this
        righteousness to those who by it are ‘made righteous. ’ ‘They shall be
        called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He may be
        glorified,’ Isaiah 61:3. ‘Thy people shall be all righteous, they shall
        inherit the land for ever,’ Isaiah 60:21.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14, 15. — For if they which are of law be heirs, faith is made
        void, and the promise made of none effect: for the law worketh wrath:
        for where no law is there is no transgression.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it is said, ‘If they which are of law,’ that is, who by obeying the
        law of God be heirs, the case is supposed, as in ch. 2:13, 26, 27,
        though not admitted, which would be contrary to the whole train of the
        Apostle’s argument. If, however, possession of the inheritance come by
        obedience to law, then the obtaining it by faith is set aside, and
        consequently, as by works of law no man can be justified, the promise is
        made of none effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is entirely consistent with all the Apostle had said before
        respecting the manner in which the blessedness of Abraham had come upon
        him, solely by the imputation of righteousness received by faith,
        irrespective of any works of his. For the law worketh wrath. — It is
        indeed the nature of every law to afford opportunity of transgression.
        But this does not make it work wrath. It is law which is transgressed
        that works wrath. The Apostle had shown that by obedience to law no man
        can be justified, since all men are transgressors, and that the wrath of
        God is revealed against all unrighteousness; and this is what here he
        again declares. Such is the state of human nature, that the law of God,
        which all men transgress, so far from justifying them, can only work
        wrath, or punishment; for no law makes provision for the exercise of
        mercy, but requires perfect obedience to all its commands, and when this
        is not yielded, denounces wrath on every transgressor. For where no law
        is, there is no transgression. — This is the reason why the law works
        wrath. It gives occasion to transgress, and transgression brings wrath.
        And this, the Apostle asserts, is the nature of law in general. Where
        there is law, there is occasion or room for transgression. Where there
        is no law, there can be no breach of law. If a man could be placed in a
        situation without law, he would not be exposed to wrath as guilty; for
        as sin is the transgression of the law, so no transgression could be
        charged on him. This assertion, then, is equivalent to affirming that,
        considering the character of man, where law is there must be
        transgression, and only where there is no law there is no transgression,
        as it is said, ch. 5:13, ‘Sin is not imputed where there is no law.’
        From all this it follows, that if the fulfillment of the promise was
        dependent on man’s obedience to the law, the obtaining of the
        inheritance by faith would be made void, and so the promise would become
        of no effect; thus the possibility of obtaining the inheritance would be
        destroyed altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
        end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is
        of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is
        the father of us all, Having affirmed, in the end of the 13th verse,
        that the promise of the inheritance was not through obedience to law,
        but through the righteousness received by faith, and having in the 14th
        and 15th verses shown that it would not be obtained through obedience to
        law, Paul here proceeds to state why faith was appointed to be the way
        through which it should be carried into effect. Therefore it is of
        faith, that is might be by grace. — Since, then, the promise of the
        inheritance, that is, of eternal salvation, could not be fulfilled
        through obedience to law, it was appointed that it should be fulfilled
        through faith, because in this way it is effected by grace. A reward
        must be reckoned either of grace, or of debt, on account of works
        performed; and these cannot be combined. For ‘if by grace, then it is no
        more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace; but if it be of works,
        then is it no more grace; otherwise work is no more work,’ Romans 11:6.
        As the reward, then, could not be bestowed through the works of the law,
        of which every man is a transgressor, and which, therefore, could only
        work wrath to him, it must be conferred by grace through faith, which
        can in nowise be considered as meritorious, but is the gift of God, and
        simply receives His righteousness, opposed through the whole of this
        discussion to the works of man of every description. In this way, then,
        the promise is bestowed by grace. This accords with the whole plan of
        salvation, that regards man as a sinner, and according to which, as had
        been shown, ch. 3:27, boasting is excluded, and he is saved, not of
        works, but by grace through faith, Ephesians 2:8. In no other way, then,
        but through faith, could salvation have been by grace. Had it been
        bestowed in part or in whole as the reward of one good thought, it would
        not have been by grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul had before declared that they who have obtained the righteousness
        of God by faith are justified freely by His grace; and now he affirms
        that salvation is through faith, for this very purpose, that it might be
        by grace. To the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed. —
        The fulfillment of the promise to Abraham and to his seed not being
        grounded on obedience to law, which, in the case of every man, would
        have made it void, and as its fulfillment was determined by God, He has
        rested its accomplishment wholly on grace — His own gratuitous favor,
        which cannot be frustrated. Grace selects its objects, and its only
        motive is in God Himself The way, then, in which the promise was to be
        accomplished, depending on the sovereign will of God, who hath said, ‘My
        counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure,’ Isaiah 46:10, and
        whose gifts and calling are without repentance, was rendered secure, and
        the promise could not be made void by the unworthiness or mutability of
        man. Not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of
        the faith of Abraham. — The promise, then, was made sure by the grace of
        God, through faith, to all Abraham’s spiritual seed, not only to such as
        were ‘of the law,’ namely, his natural offspring under the legal
        dispensation, denominated in verses 9 and 12 the circumcision, but also
        to all of every nation who, though uncircumcised, possess his faith. To
        himself and to all of them it is accomplished through the righteousness
        of faith. Here it is worthy of observation, that none are supposed to be
        Abraham’s spiritual seed, or heirs as his seed, except believers,
        whether they ‘be his descendants or Gentiles. Who is the father of us
        all. — That is, the spiritual father both of Jewish and Gentile
        believers. He is equally in this sense the father of all believers. It
        is only by faith that he is the spiritual father of any.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many
        nations,) before Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
        dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, — According
        to the Apostle’s interpretation of this promise, it imports a numerous
        spiritual offspring, as well as a numerous natural posterity. It is not
        by way of what is called accommodation that this is said; it is the real
        interpretation of the promise, whether Abraham himself understood it so
        or not. This interpretation of the Apostle is a key to all that is said
        on this subject. It shows that Abraham had a double seed, that the
        promise had a double meaning, and both are distinctly verified. Thus,
        each of the three promises made to Abraham had a double fulfillment: —
        Of a numerous posterity; of God being a God to his seed; and of the
        earthly and heavenly country. Before Him. — At that moment, when he
        stood in the presence of God whom he believed, Genesis 17:4, he was made
        the father of all his natural and spiritual posterity; and though he was
        not then actually a father, yet, being so in the purpose of God, it was
        made as sure to him as if it had already taken place. God now willed it,
        and the result would follow as surely as creation followed His word.
        Quickeneth the dead. — Does this refer to the literal general fact of
        bringing the dead to life, or to Abraham’s body now dead, and Sarah’s
        incapacity of having children at her advanced age, or to the raising of
        Isaac had he been sacrificed? The first appears to be the meaning, and
        includes the others; and the belief of it is the ground on which the
        others rest. Faith in God’s power, as raising the dead, is a proper
        ground of believing any other work of power which God engages to
        perform, or which is necessary to be performed, in order to fulfill His
        word. If God raises the dead, why should Abraham look with distrust on
        his own body, or consider Sarah’s natural incapacity to bear children?
        Why should he doubt that God will fulfill His promise as to his numerous
        seed by Isaac, even though Isaac shall be slain? God could raise him
        from the dead. Calleth those things which be not as though they were. —
        This does not say that God calls into existence the things that exist
        not, as He calls into existence the things that are. But God speaks of
        the things that exist not, in the same way as He speaks of the things
        that exist; that is, He speaks of them as existing, though they do not
        then actually exiSt. And this is the way He spoke of Abraham as the
        father of many nations. I have made thee. — God calls him now a father,
        though he was not actually a father of many nations, because, before
        God, or in God’s counsel, he was such a father.
