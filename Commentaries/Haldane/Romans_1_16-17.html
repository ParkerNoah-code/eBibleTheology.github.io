      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        HAVING concluded his prefatory address, the Apostle now announces, in
        brief but comprehensive terms, the grand subject which occupies the
        first five chapters of this Epistle, namely, the doctrine of
        justification by faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the
        power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew
        first, and also to the Greek.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not ashamed . — Paul here follows up what he had just said of his
        readiness to preach the Gospel at Rome, by declaring that he was not
        ashamed of it. This would also convey a caution to those whom he
        addressed against giving way to a strong temptation to which they were
        exposed, and which was no doubt a means of deterring many from embracing
        the Gospel, to whom it was preached. He knew from personal experience
        the opposition which the Gospel everywhere encountered. By the Pagans it
        was branded as Atheism; and by the Jews it was abhorred as subverting
        the law and tending to licentiousness; while both Jews and Gentiles
        united in denouncing the Christians as disturbers of the public peace,
        who, in their pride and presumption, separated themselves from the rest
        of mankind. Besides, a crucified Savior was to the one a
        stumbling-block, and to the other foolishness. This doctrine was
        everywhere spoken against; and the Christian fortitude of the Apostle,
        in acting on the avowal he here makes, was as truly manifested in the
        calmness with which he viewed the disdain of the philosophers, the
        contempt of the proud, and the ridicule of the multitude, as in the
        steadfast resolution with which, for the name of the Lord Jesus, he
        confronted personal danger, and even death itself. His courage was not
        more conspicuous when he was ready ‘not to be bound only, but also to
        die at Jerusalem,’ than when he was enabled to enter Athens or Rome
        without being moved by the prospect of all that scorn and derision which
        in these great cities awaited him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the grand reason which induced the Apostle to declare at the outset
        of this Epistle that he was not ashamed of the Gospel, is a reason which
        applies to every age as well as to that in which Christ was first
        preached.
      </p>
      <p>
        His declaration implies that, while in reality there is no just cause to
        be ashamed of the Gospel, there is in it something which is not
        acceptable, and that it is generally hated and despised among men. The
        natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
        foolishness unto him. They run counter to his most fondly-cherished
        notions of independence; they abase in the dust all the pride of his
        self-reliance, and, stripping him of every ground of boasting, and
        demanding implicit submission, they awaken all the enmity of the carnal
        mind. Even they who have tasted of the grace of God, are liable to
        experience, and often to yield to, the deeply-rooted and sinful feeling
        of being ashamed of the things of God. So prevalent is this even among
        Christians the most advanced, that Paul deemed it necessary to warn
        Timothy respecting it, whose faithfulness he so highly celebrates. ‘Be
        not that therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord.’ In connection
        with this, he makes the same avowal for himself as in the passage before
        us, declaring at the same time the strong ground on which he rested, and
        was enabled to resist this temptation. Whereunto, he says, ‘I am
        appointed a preacher, and an Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. For
        which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed;
        for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to
        keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.’ At ‘the
        same time he commends Onesiphorus for not being ashamed of his chain, 2
        Timothy 1:8,12,16. And He who knew what is in man, solemnly and
        repeatedly guarded His disciples against this criminal shame, enforcing
        His admonitions by the most awful sanction. ‘For whosoever shall be
        ashamed of Me and of my words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed,
        when He shall come in His own glory, and in His Father’s, and of His
        holy angels.’
      </p>
      <p>
        That system, in which there is nothing of ‘foolishness’ in the eyes of
        this world’s wisdom, cannot be the Gospel of which Paul deemed it
        necessary to affirm that he was not ashamed. No other religion is so
        offensive to the pride of man; no other system awakens shame in the
        breasts of its votaries; and yet every false doctrine has in it more or
        less of what is positively absurd, irrational, and disgraceful. It is
        also observable that the more the Gospel is corrupted, and the more its
        peculiar features are obscured by error, the less do we observe of the
        shame it is calculated to produce. It is, in fact, the fear of
        opposition and contempt that often leads to the corruption of the
        Gospel. But this peculiarity affords a strong proof of the truth of the
        Apostle’s doctrine. Had he not been convinced of its truth, would it not
        have been madness to invent a forgery in a form which excites the
        natural prejudices of mankind! Why should he forge a doctrine which he
        was aware would be hateful to the world? In this declaration Paul may
        also have had reference to the false mysteries of the Pagans, which they
        carefully concealed, because they contained many things that were
        infamous, and of which they were justly ashamed. When the Apostle says
        he is not ashamed of the Gospel, it further implies that he gloried in
        it, as he says, Galatians 6:14, ‘God forbid that I should glory, save in
        the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ;’ and thus he endeavors to enhance,
        in the eyes of those to whom he wrote, the value and excellence of the
        Gospel, in order more fully to arrest their attention before he entered
        on his subject. The Gospel of Christ. — A little before he had called it
        ‘the Gospel of God;’ he now designates it the Gospel of Christ, who is
        not only its author, but also its essential subject. The Gospel is
        therefore called the preaching of Jesus Christ, and of the unsearchable
        riches of Christ. This Gospel, then, which Paul was ready to preach, and
        of which he was not ashamed, was the Gospel of God concerning His Son.
        The term Gospel, which signifies glad tidings, is taken from Isaiah
        52:7, and <2236101> 61:1, where the Messiah is introduced as saying,
        ‘The Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings.’
      </p>
      <p>
        For it is the power of God unto salvation. — Here the Apostle gives the
        reason why he is not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ. The Gospel is the
        great and admirable mystery, which from the beginning of the world had
        been hid in God, into which the angels desire to look, whereby His
        manifold wisdom is made known unto the principalities and powers in
        heavenly places. It is the efficacious means by which God saves men from
        sin and misery, and bestows on them eternal life, — the instrument by
        which He triumphs in their hearts, and destroys in them the dominion of
        Satan. The Gospel, which is the word of God, is quick and powerful, and
        sharper than any two-edged sword. By it, as the word of truth, men are
        begotten by the will of God, James 1:18; 1 Peter 1:23; and through the
        faith of the Gospel they are kept by His power unto salvation, Peter
        1:5. The exceeding greatness of the power of God exerted in the Gospel
        toward those who believe, is compared to His mighty power which He
        wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His
        own right hand, Ephesians 1:19. Thus, while the preaching of the cross
        is to them that perish foolishness, to those who are saved it is the
        power of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel is power in the hand of God, as opposed to our natural
        impotence and utter inability to obtain salvation by anything we can do,
        Romans 5:6; and also in opposition to the law, which cannot save, being
        ‘weak through the flesh,’ Romans 8:3. It has been observed that the
        article the, before power, is not in the original. The article, however,
        is not necessary. The Apostle does not mean power as an attribute, for
        the Gospel is no attribute of God. It is power, as it is the means which
        God employs to accomplish a certain end. When it is said, the Gospel is
        God’s power unto salvation, all other means of salvation are excluded.
        To every one that believeth. — This power of God unto salvation is
        applied through faith, without which God will neither justify nor save
        any man, because it is the appointed means of His people’s union with
        Jesus Christ. Faith accepts the promise of God. Faith embraces the
        satisfaction and merit of Jesus Christ, which are the foundation of
        salvation; and neither that satisfaction nor that merit would be
        imputed, were it not rendered ours by faith. Finally, by faith we give
        ourselves to Jesus Christ, in order that He may possess and conduct us
        for ever. When God justifies, He gives grace; but it is always in
        maintaining the rights of His majesty, in making us submit to His law
        and to the direction of His holiness, that Jesus Christ may reign in our
        hearts. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one,
        without any distinction of age, sex, or condition — of birth or of
        country, — without excepting any one, provided he be a believer in
        Christ. The expression, ‘every one,’ respects the extent of the call of
        the Gospel, in opposition to that of the law, which was addressed to the
        single family of Abraham. To the Jew first, and also to the Greek. —
        This distinction includes all nations; for the Jews were accustomed to
        comprehend under the name of Greek all the rest of the world, as opposed
        to their own nation. The Greeks, from the establishment of the
        Macedonian empire, were better known to the Jews than any other people,
        not only on account of their power, but likewise of their knowledge and
        civilization. Paul frequently avails himself of this distinction. To the
        Jew first. — From the days of Abraham, their great progenitor, the Jews
        had been highly distinguished from all the rest of the world by their
        many and great privileges. It was their high distinction that of them
        Christ came, ‘who is over all, God blessed for ever.’ They were thus, as
        His kinsmen, the royal family of the human race, in this respect higher
        than all others, and they inherited Emmanuel’s land. While, therefore,
        the evangelical covenant, and consequently justification and salvation,
        equally regarded all believers, the Jews held the first rank, as the
        ancient people of God, while the other nations were strangers from the
        covenants of promise. The preaching of the Gospel was to be addressed to
        them first, and, at the beginning, to them alone, Matthew 10:6; for,
        during the abode of Jesus Christ upon earth, He was the minister only of
        the circumcision, Romans 15:8. ‘I am not sent,’ He says, ‘but to the
        lost sheep of the house of Israel;’ and He commanded that repentance and
        remission of Sins should be preached in His name among all nations,
        ‘beginning at Jerusalem,’ Acts 3:26, 14:26. Thus, while Jews and
        Gentiles were united in the participation of the Gospel, the Jews were
        not deprived of their rank, since they were the first called.
      </p>
      <p>
        The preaching of the Gospel to the Jews first, served various important
        ends. It fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, as Isaiah 2:3. It
        manifested the compassion of the Lord Jesus for those who shed His
        blood, to whom, after His resurrection, He commanded His Gospel to be
        first proclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It showed that it was to be preached to the chief of sinners, and proved
        the sovereign efficacy of His atonement in expatiating the guilt even of
        His murderers. It was fit, too, that the Gospel should be begun to be
        preached where the great transactions took place on which it was founded
        and established; and this furnished an example of the way in which it is
        the will of the Lord that His Gospel should be propagated by His
        disciples, beginning in their own houses and their own country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith
        to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        The righteousness of God. — This phrase may, according to circumstances,
        mean either the personal attribute of God, or, as in this place, the
        righteousness which God has provided, which He has effected, and which
        He imputes for justification to all His elect. It is through this
        righteousness, revealed in the Gospel, that the Gospel is the power of
        God unto salvation. Paul reverts to its manifestation, ch. 3:21, where
        the signification of this most important expression will be fully
        considered. At present it is sufficient to remark that the grand object
        of the Apostle is to show that man, having lost his own righteousness,
        and thereby fallen under condemnation, God has provided for him a
        righteousness — the complete fulfillment of the law in all its
        threatenings and all its precepts — by which, being placed to his
        account through faith, he is acquitted from guilt, freed from
        condemnation, and entitled to the reward of eternal life. Is revealed —
        This expression regards the assertion in the second verse of this
        chapter, that the Gospel had formerly been promised by the Prophets. The
        righteousness of God must be contemplated at three periods: first, at
        the period when God purposed it; second, at the period when He promised
        it; and third, at the period when He revealed it. He purposed it in His
        eternal decrees, He promised it after the fall, and now it is actually
        revealed in the Gospel. Paul does not say that it began only under the
        Gospel to display its efficacy, or that it was not known under the
        Mosaic dispensation; on the contrary, he was about to show that the
        Prophet Habakkuk had referred to it, and in the fourth chapter he proves
        that Abraham was justified by the imputation of this same righteousness;
        but he here declares that its full and perfect revelation was made by
        the Gospel, in which it is testified that at length it has been ‘brought
        in,’ as had been promised, Daniel 9:24. Looking forward to the
        revelation of this righteousness, the Prophet Isaiah, 56:1, writes,
        ‘Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice; for My salvation
        is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.’ The Prophet thus
        announced in his time that it was near to be revealed, and the Apostle
        affirms that it is now revealed. From faith to faith. — Various
        interpretations have been given of this phrase, although there appears
        to be little difficulty in ascertaining its meaning. Some explain it as
        signifying from the faith of the Old Testament to the faith of the New;
        some, from one degree of faith to another; some, from the faith of the
        Jew to the faith of the Gentile; and others, altogether of faith. The
        expression is evidently elliptical; and in order to understand it, it is
        necessary to observe that the literal rendering is not ‘from faith to
        faith,’ but ‘by faith to faith.’ The same words in the original are thus
        translated in the same verse: ‘The just shall live by faith.’ The
        meaning, then, is, the righteousness which is by faith, namely, which is
        received by faith, is revealed to faith, or in order to be believed.
        This is entirely constant with what the Apostle says in ch. 3:22, where
        he reverts to the subject, and announces that the righteousness of God,
        which is by, or through, faith of Jesus Christ, is unto all and upon all
        them that believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is then no difficulty in this expression, especially since the
        meaning is placed beyond dispute in this passage, where the same truth
        is fully expressed. As it is written. — Here is a reference to the Old
        Testament Scriptures, as attesting what had just been affirmed, thus
        proving the correspondence between the Old Testament and the New, as was
        also shown in the second verse of this chapter, and teaching us to rest
        our faith on the testimony of the Scriptures, in whatever part of them
        it is found. The just shall live by faith, or rather, following the
        order of the words in the original, be just, or the righteous, by faith
        shall live. The doctrine, however, is substantially the same in
        whichsoever of these ways the phrase is rendered, and the meaning is,
        they who are righteous by faith, that is, by having the righteousness of
        God which is received by faith imputed to them, shall live. Paul repeats
        the same declaration in two other places, namely, in Galatians 3:11,
        where he proves that men cannot be justified by the law, and also in
        Hebrews 10:38, where he is exhorting those to whom he writes to continue
        firm in the faith; and immediately afterwards, explaining the meaning of
        that expression, he shows at large, in the following chapter, that men
        were saved by faith before, as well as after, the coming of the Messiah.
        In both cases the eye of faith was steadfastly fixed on the same
        glorious object. Before His advent, faith rested on that event,
        considered in the promise. After the coming of the Messiah, faith
        rejoices in the accomplishment of the promise. Thus it is only by faith
        in the testimony of God, as receiving His righteousness wrought by the
        Messiah, that man can be just or righteous in His sight. The passage
        itself is quoted from the prophecies of Habakkuk, and is generally
        supposed to relate, in its primary sense, to the deliverance from the
        Babylonish captivity, which was a type of the deliverance obtained by
        the Gospel. Through faith in the Divine promises the first was obtained,
        and the second in like manner is obtained through faith. But in whatever
        sense the Prophet used these words, the Apostle, speaking by the same
        Spirit, assigns to them their just and legitimate extension. They are
        true in respect to an earthly and temporal deliverance, and are equally
        true in respect to a spiritual deliverance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many, however, understand such quotations, where the Apostle says it is
        written , as mere accommodation, not implying prediction of the thing to
        which they are applied. This is a most unwarrantable and baneful method
        of handling the word of God. It is in this light that Professors Tholuck
        and Stuart, in their Commentaries on this Epistle, often view this form
        of expression. But, on the contrary, it is always used as introducing
        what is represented as a fulfillment of prediction, or an interpretation
        of its meaning. If Neologians are to be held guilty for explaining the
        miracles of Christ on natural principles, are they less criminal who
        explain, as mere accommodation of Scripture language, what is quoted by
        an Apostle as a fulfillment of prophecy? Several quotations from the Old
        Testament in this Epistle are explained by both these authors on the
        above Neological principle. Professor Stuart, on this passage, says, ‘It
        is not necessary to suppose, in all cases of this nature, that the
        writer who makes such an appeal regards the passage which he quotes as
        prediction. Plainly this is not always the case with the writers of the
        New Testament, as nearly all commentators now concede.’ Professor
        Tholuck remarks that ‘the pious Jew loved to use Bible phrases in
        speaking of the things of common life, as this seemed to connect, in a
        manner, his personal observations and the events of his own history with
        those of holy writ.’ He adds, that the Talmud contains numerous
        quotations introduced by such forms, ‘without,’ he continues, ‘there
        being understood any real fulfillment of the text in the fact which is
        spoken of. This practice was also followed by the Apostles.’ The subject
        of quotation by accommodation is one of such paramount importance,
        involving so deeply the honor of the Holy Scriptures, and at the same
        time is so lightly thought of by many, that it challenges the most
        serious attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing can be more dishonorable to the character of Divine revelation,
        and injurious to the edification of believers, than this method of
        explaining the quotations in the New Testament from the Old, not as
        predictions or interpretations, but as mere illustrations by way of
        accommodation. In this way many of the prophecies referred to in the
        Epistles are thrust aside from their proper application, and Christians
        are taught that they do not prove the very things the Apostles adduced
        them to establish.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great temptation to this manner of understanding them, is the fact
        that such prophecies generally, as they lie in the Old Testament, are
        obviously applied to temporal events, whereas, in the New, they are
        applied to the affairs of Christ and His kingdom. But this is a
        difficulty to none who understand the nature of the Old Testament
        dispensation, while the supposition that it is a difficulty, argues an
        astonishing want of attention to both covenants. Not only the
        ceremonies, but the personages, facts, and whole history of the Jewish
        people, have a letter and a spirit, without the knowledge of which they
        cannot be understood either in their true sense, or in a sense at all
        worthy of God. That the Old Testament predictions, then, should
        primarily refer to temporal events in the Jewish history, and in a
        secondary but more important view, to the Messiah and the Gospel, is
        quite in accordance with what is taught us everywhere by the New
        Testament. Instead of creating a difficulty, this peculiarity is
        entirely consistent with the prominent features of Christianity, and
        calls for fresh admiration of the Divine wisdom. It is one of those
        characteristics which prove the Bible to be God’s own book; and, as
        usual, men’s attempts to mend it only serve to mar its beauty and
        obscure its evidence. In Galatians 3:10, it is asserted that ‘as many as
        are of the works of the law are under the curse.’ Why are they affirmed
        to be under the curse?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it is written, ‘ Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
        things which are written in the book of the law to do them.’ The phrase
        it is written is used here to connect an inference or conclusion with
        the premises on which it is founded. The assertion, that all who are of
        the works of the law are under the curse, is founded on the thing said
        to be written. The phrase, then, is indicative of true fulfillment or
        interpretation of meaning.
      </p>

        In like manner, what is spoken of, Matthew 13:14, and John 12:39,40, is,
        in Romans 11:8, introduced with the phrase ‘it is written.’ By the same
        phrase also is introduced, Galatians 4:27, the reference to the prophecy
        of Isaiah, 54:1. This must be prediction, because there does not appear
        to be any reference to a subordinate event in the Jewish history. It is
        an immediate prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        We learn from Galatians 4:21-26, that even the history of Abraham’s
        family was typical, and the recorded facts of ancient times are
        explained as predictions of Gospel times. ‘Tell me, ye that desire to be
        under the law, do ye not hear the law?’ In what respect could they hear
        the law on the point referred to? In the events that took place in
        Abraham’s house. These facts are represented as a part of the law, and
        the spiritual truth at the proper interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only is the phrase ‘it is written’ always applied to indicate
        prediction or interpretation, but it was so understood and applied in
        our Lord’s time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the priests and scribes were asked where Christ should be born,
        they answered, in Bethlehem, for thus it is written , Matthew 2:5. This
        phrase, then, they employed to indicate true fulfillment of prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This very reference to Habakkuk is explained, Galatians 3:11, as
        prediction. It is asserted in the beginning of the verse, that no man
        can be justified by the law, because it is written by the Prophet. Here
        the impossibility of justification by the law is founded on the prophecy
        quoted. But if this prophecy related only to a temporal event in the
        Jewish history, the fact being so written would not bear out the
        conclusion. That the prophecy there refers to the justification of
        sinners before God, as its true and most important meaning, is the
        necessary sense of the passage. So little foundation have the
        above-named writers for their bold perversions of the word of God on
        their, point. Their doctrine respecting it manifests great ignorance of
        Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passage in Matthew 2:15, has been supposed by some to be utterly
        incapable of interpretation, in the sense of real fulfillment, as
        prediction. ‘Out of Egypt have I called My Son.’ The prophecy there
        referred to is found in Hosea 11:1, and evidently refers to the calling
        of the Israelites out of Egypt. How then can it be the fulfillment of
        the prophecy according to the application in the Evangelist? Nothing is
        more easy than the solution of this supposed insuperable difficulty. The
        words of the Prophet have, in the primary or literal sense, a reference
        to the historical event — the calling of the Israelites, as nationally
        the typical Son of God, out of the land of Egypt; and, in the secondary
        or spiritual sense, couched under the figure, they refer to the calling
        of the true Son of God out of Egypt, where He had gone to sojourn in
        order to accomplish this prediction. The Son of God is, in Isaiah 49:3,
        expressly addressed under the name of Israel. It argues the highest
        presumption, and even blasphemy, to explain this quotation on the
        principle of accommodation, when the Evangelist says ‘that it might be
        fulfilled,’ and thus intimates that this event was one predetermined in
        the counsels of Eternity. Is mere accommodation fulfillment in any
        sense? How must infidels sneer at such violent efforts to explain away a
        difficulty, which is, after all, imaginary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language here used by the Evangelist establishes beyond all
        contradiction the double reference of many of the prophecies of the Old
        Testament.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some commentators refer to Acts 28:25, as an example of a passage which
        the Apostle quotes as prediction, when it is not prediction. This
        Scripture is supposed to have reference to the Jews, as neglecting all
        warnings till they were finally carried into captivity. It may have such
        a reference. But this is not so certain as that it has the secondary
        reference to the state of the Jews with respect to the rejection of the
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, then, of being received as applied to the latter by way of
        accommodation, or as illustrative of the same principle, there is no
        absolute certainty of a primary reference; but there can be no doubt
        that it predicts the unbelief and hardness of heart manifested by the
        Jews in the time of our Lord, and afterwards. This is irresistibly
        evident from Matthew 13:14. Here it is expressly said to be a fulfilling
        of the prophecy, that ‘in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias,
        which saith,’ etc. The unbelief of the Jews is here, in express words,
        stated as the fulfillment of this same prophecy. Is it not wonderful
        blindness, is it not the most profane temerity, to explain as mere
        accommodation what the Holy Spirit asserts to be a real fulfillment? The
        same prophecy is referred to in John’s Gospel as fulfilled in the Jews
        of our Lord’s time, ch. 12:39, ‘Therefore they could not believe,
        because that Esaias said again.’
      </p>
      <p>
        What can more strongly express prediction? Belief was impossible,
        because of the prediction. They were the words of God, and, therefore,
        must be fulfilled. As this is a subject of so much importance, demanding
        the serious attention of all who tremble at the word of God, and one
        which is so frequently, I may say so generally, misrepresented, I shall
        further repeat the following remarks respecting it, from my Book of
        Evidences, vol. 1: p. 450, third edition, on the Old Testament
        prophecies: — ‘It is not as setting aside the literal application of
        such passages, that the Apostles quote them in their spiritual import;
        nor in the way of accommodation, as is often erroneously asserted: but
        in their ultimate and most extensive significations. Nothing has been
        more mischievous, more audacious, and more dishonorable to the character
        of revelation, than the doctrine that represents the New Testament
        writers as quoting the Old Testament prophecies by way of accommodation.
        It is based on the supposed difficulty or impossibility of explaining
        the agreement in the literal accomplishment. To this it may be replied,
        that satisfactory solutions of the cases of difficulty have been given.
        But though no satisfactory solution were given, the supposition would be
        inadmissible. It contradicts most explicitly the Spirit of God, and must
        be rejected, let the solution be what it may. The New Testament writers,
        in quoting the Old Testament prophecies, quote them as being fulfilled
        in the event which is related. If it is not truly fulfilled, the
        assertion of fulfillment is false. The fulfillment by accommodation is
        no fulfillment in any real sense of the word. This interpretation, then,
        cannot be admitted, as being palpably contradictory to the language of
        inspiration. To quote the Old Testament prophecies in this way, could
        not, in any respect, serve the purpose of the writers of the New
        Testament. What confirmation to their doctrine could they find from the
        language of a prophecy that did not really refer to the subject to which
        they applied it, but was merely capable of some fanciful accommodation?
        It is ascribing to these writers, or rather to the Spirit of God, a
        puerility of which every writer of sound judgment would be ashamed. The
        application of the language of inspiration by way of accommodation, is a
        theory that has sometimes found patrons among a certain class of
        writers; but a due respect for the inspired writings will ever reject it
        with abhorrence. It is an idle parade of ingenuity, even when it
        coincides in its explanations with the truths of the Scriptures; but to
        call such an accommodation of Scripture language a fulfillment, is
        completely absurd. There is nothing in Scripture to warrant such a mode
        of explanation.’ ‘To say,’ observes Mr. Bell, on the Covenants, ‘that
        these Scriptures had no relation to these events, what is this but to
        give the inspired penman the lie? The question is not what the Old
        Testament writers intended in such and such sayings, but what the Spirit
        which was in them did signify.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Prophets might often not know the full extent of their own prophecy,
        but certainly the Spirit, by which they spake, always did. The Spirit in
        the Old Testament writers was the same who inspired those of the New,
        Corinthians 4:13; therefore, when the latter quote the words of the
        former as predictive of, and fulfilled in, certain events, the Holy
        Spirit is pointing out what He Himself intended. And who dare say but
        that He may point out more fully under the New Testament what He
        intended in the Old, than ever could have entered into the heart of man?
        1 Corinthians 2:9,10. Surely the only wise God must be allowed to know
        the full sense of His own words. When the Evangelists or Apostles tell
        us that such and such Scriptures were fulfilled in such events, they do
        not give a new sense to these Scriptures which they never had before,
        but only show what before was latent with us. To say that any of their
        quotations from the Old Testament are mere allusions, or only used by
        way of accommodation to their purpose, beyond the true sense of the
        words and the intention of the Holy Ghost, effectually cuts the sinews
        of their argumentation, and, of course, destroys the proofs they
        adduce,’ p. 56. The misunderstanding, or rather denial on this point, of
        the plain import of Scripture, in representing the New Testament writers
        as quoting from the Old Testament in the way of accommodation, appears
        to originate, so far as concerns Professors Tholuck and Stuart, in their
        want of acquaintance with the nature of the inspiration of the Bible.
        Were this not the case, they could not have ventured to take such
        liberties with the Scriptures as appear in their Commentaries. f9 The
        declaration in the 16th and 17th verses, that the Gospel is the power of
        God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and
        also to the Greek, because therein is the righteousness of God revealed,
        serves as the text or ground of the whole of the subsequent disquisition
        in this and the following nine chapters.
