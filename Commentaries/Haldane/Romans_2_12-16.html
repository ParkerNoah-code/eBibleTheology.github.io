      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 12. — For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
        without law: and as many as have sinned in (or under) law shall be
        judged by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here Paul explains the equality of the judgment, both with respect to
        the Gentiles and the Jews. Without law, that is, a written law; for none
        are without law, as the Apostle immediately afterwards shows. The
        Gentiles had not received the written law; they had, however, sinned,
        and they shall perish — that is to say, be condemned — without that law.
        The Jews had receded the written law; they had also sinned, they will be
        judged — that is to say condemned — by that law; for in the next verse
        Paul declares that only the doers of the law shall be justified; and
        consequently, as condemnation stands opposed to justification, they who
        are not doers of it will be condemned. In one word, the Divine justice
        will only regard the sins of men; and wherever these are found, it will
        condemn the sinner. The Gentiles shall perish without law. They will
        perish, though they are not to be judged by the written law. It is
        alleged by some, that although the Apostle’s language shows that all the
        Gentiles are guilty before God, yet it does not imply that they will be
        condemned; for that they may he guilty, yet be saved by mercy through
        Jesus Christ. But the language of the Apostle entirely precludes the
        possibility of such a supposition. It is not said that they who have
        sinned without law are guilty without law, but that they shall ‘perish
        without law.’ The language, then, does not merely assert their guilt,
        but clearly asserts their condemnation. They shall perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        No criticism can make this expression consistent with the salvation of
        the Gentiles who know not God. They will be condemned by the work of the
        law written in their hearts. Many are inclined to think that the
        condemnation of the heathen is peculiarly hard; but it is equally just,
        and not more severe, than the punishment of those who have sinned
        against revelation. They will not be Judged by the light which they had
        not, nor punished so severely as they who resisted that light.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ver. 13. — (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
        doers of the law shall be justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse, with the two following, forms a parenthesis between the 12th
        and 16th, explanatory of the two propositions contained in the 12th.
        Some also include the 11th and 12th in the parenthesis. If this mode of
        punctuation were adopted, the 13th, 14th, and 15th verses would be a
        parenthesis within a parenthesis; but for this there is no occasion, as
        the 11th and 12th verses connect with the 10th, and also with the 16th.
        For not the hearers of the law. — Against what the Apostle had just said
        concerning the equality of the judgment, two objections might be urged,
        — the one in favor of the Gentiles, the other in favor of the Jews. The
        first is, that since God has not given His law to the Gentiles, there
        can be no place for their condemnation, — for how can they be condemned
        as transgressors if they have not received a law? The second objection,
        which is contrary to the first, supposes that the Jews ought to be more
        leniently treated, since God, who has given them His law, has, by doing
        so, declared in their favor, and made them His people: He will
        therefore, without doubt, have a regard for them which He has not for
        the others, whom he has abandoned. The Apostle obviates both these
        objections in this and the two following verses, and thus defends his
        position respecting the equality of the judgment. As for the last of
        them, which he answers first in this 13th verse, he says that it is not
        sufficient for justification before God to have received the law, and
        simply to be hearers of it; but that it must be observed and reduced to
        practice. This is an incontestable truth. For the law has not been given
        as a matter of curiosity or contemplation as a philosophical science,
        but to be obeyed; and the greatest outrage against the law and the
        Legislator, is to hear it and not to take heed to practice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will be in vain, therefore, for the Jew to say, I am a hearer of the
        law, I attend on its services, I belong to the covenant of God, who has
        given me His testimonies. On all these accounts, being a transgressor,
        as he is, he must be condemned. The presence of the article before the
        word law in both the clauses of this verse, which is wanting in the
        preceding verse, shows that the reference is here to the Jews under the
        written law. The doers of the law shall be justified. — By this we must
        understand an exact obedience to the law to be intended, which can
        defend itself against that declaration, ‘Cursed is every one that
        continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
        do them.’ For it is not the same with the judgment of the law as with
        that of grace. The Gospel indeed requires of us a perfect obedience to
        its commands, yet it not only provides for believers’ pardon of the sins
        committed before their calling, but of those also which they afterwards
        commit. But the judgment of the law admits of no indulgence to those who
        are under it; it demands a full and perfect personal observance of all
        its requirements — a patient continuance in well-doing, without the
        least deviation, or the smallest speck of sin; and when it does not find
        this state of perfection, condemns the man. But did not the law itself
        contain expiations for sin? and consequently, shall not the judgment
        which will be passed according to the law, be accompanied with grace and
        indulgence through the benefit of these expiations? The legal expiations
        had no virtue in themselves; but inasmuch as they were figures of the
        expiation made by Jesus Christ, they directed men to His sacrifice. But
        as they belonged to the temporal or carnal covenant, they neither
        expiated nor could expiate any but typical sins, that is to say,
        uncleanness of the flesh, Hebrews 9:13, which were not real sins, but
        only external pollutions. Thus, as far as regarded the legal sacrifices,
        all real sins remained on the conscience, Hebrews 10:1, for from these
        the law did not in the smallest degree discharge; whence it follows that
        the judgment, according to the law, to those who are under it, will be a
        strict judgment according to law, which pardons nothing. The word
        justified occurs here for the first time in this Epistle, and being
        introduced in connection with the general judgment, means being declared
        just or righteous by a judicial sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — For when the gentiles, which have not a law, do by nature the
        things contained in the law, these, having not a law, are a law unto
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        For. — This is the proper translation of the Greek particle, and not
        therefore according to Dr. Macknight, who entirely misunderstands both
        the meaning of the passage itself, and the connection in which it
        stands, and founds upon it a doctrine opposed to all that is contained
        on the subject, both in the Old Testament and the New. This verse has no
        connection with, or dependence whatever on, the foregoing, as is
        generally supposed, but connects with the first clause of verse 12,
        which it explains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with the following verse, it supplies the answer to the
        objection that might be made to what is contained in the beginning of
        that verse, namely, that God cannot justly condemn the Gentiles, since
        He has not given them a law. To this the Apostle here replies, that
        though they have not an external and written law, as that which God gave
        to the Israelites, they have, however, the law of the conscience, which
        is sufficient to establish the justice of their condemnation. This is
        the meaning of that proposition, having not a law, are a law unto
        themselves; and of that other, which show the work of the law written in
        their hearts; by which he also establishes the justice of what he had
        said in the 12th verse, that as many as have sinned without law shall
        also perish without law. He proves it in two ways: 1st , Because they do
        naturally the things that the law requires, which shows that they have a
        law in themselves, since they sometimes act according to its rule; 2nd ,
        He proves it by their not being devoid of a conscience, since, according
        to its decisions, they accuse or excuse one another. This evidently
        shows that they have a law, the work of which is written in their
        hearts, by which they discern the difference between right and wrong —
        what is just, and what is unjust.
      </p>
      <p>
        They who have not a law, — that is, an externally written law, — do by
        nature the things contained in the law. It could not be the Apostle’s
        intention to assert that the heathens in general, or that any one of
        them, kept the law written in the heart, when the contrary had been
        proved in the preceding chapter; but they did certain things, though
        imperfectly, commanded by the law, which proved that they had, by their
        original constitution, a discernment of the difference between right and
        wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        They did nothing, however, in the manner which the law required, that
        is, from the only motive that makes an action good, namely, a spirit of
        obedience, and of love to God. God governs the world in this way. He
        rules the actions of men and beasts by the instincts and affections
        which He has implanted in them. Every good action that men perform by
        nature, they do by their constitution, not from respect to the authority
        of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Pagans do many things that, as to the outward act, are
        agreeable to the law of God, is obviously true, and should not be
        denied. That they do anything acceptable to God is not true, and is not
        here asserted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their
        conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile
        accusing or else excusing one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work of the law. — We have here a distinction between the law
        itself, and the work of the law. The work of the law is the thing that
        the law doeth, — that is, what it teaches about actions, as good or bad.
        This work, or business, or office of the law, is to teach what is right
        or wrong. This, in some measure, is taught by the light of nature in the
        heart of every man.
      </p>
      <p>
        There remains, then, in all men, to a certain degree, a discernment of
        what the law requires, designated here the ‘work’ of the law; the
        performance or neglect of which is followed by the approbation or
        disapprobation of the conscience. It has no relation to the authority of
        the lawgiver, as the principle of the law itself; but solely to the
        distinction between actions, as right or wrong in themselves, and the
        hope of escaping future punishment, or of obtaining future reward. The
        love and the reverential fear of God, which are the true principles of
        obedience, have been effaced from the mind; but a degree of knowledge of
        His justice, and the consciousness that the violations of His law
        deserve and will be followed by punishment, have been retained. Written
        in their hearts. — This is an allusion to the law written by the finger
        of God upon tables of stone, and afterwards recorded in the Scriptures.
        The great principles of this law were communicated to man in his
        creation, and much of it remains with him in his fallen state. This
        natural light of the understanding is called the law written in the
        heart, because it is imprinted on the mind by the Author of creation,
        and is God’s work as much as the writing on the tables of stone.
        Conscience witnessing together, — together with the law written in the
        heart. But it may be asked, Are not these two things the same? They are
        not. They are different principles. Light, or knowledge of duty, is one
        thing, and conscience is another. Knowledge shows what is right, — the
        conscience approves of it, and condemns the contrary. We might suppose a
        being to have the knowledge of duty, without the principle that approves
        of it, and blames the transgression. Their thoughts the meanwhile
        accusing, or else excusing between one another. — Not alternately, nor
        in turn. Their reasonings (not thoughts) between one another,
        condemning, or else defending. What is the object of their condemnation
        or defense? Not themselves, but one another; that is, those between whom
        the reasonings take place. The reference evidently is to the fact that,
        in all places, in all ages, men are continually, in their mutual
        intercourse, blaming or excusing human conduct. This supposes a standard
        of reference, — a knowledge of right and wrong. No man could accuse and
        condemn another, if there were not some standard of right and wrong; and
        no man could defend an action without a similar standard. This is
        obviously the meaning of the Apostle. To these ideas of right and wrong
        are naturally joined the idea of God, who is the sovereign Judge of the
        world, and that of rewards and punishments, which will follow either
        good or bad actions. These ideas do not fail to present themselves to
        the sinner, and inspire fear and inquietude. But as, on the other hand,
        self-love and corruption reign in the heart, these come to his support,
        and strive, by vain reasonings, to defend or to extenuate the sin. The
        Gentiles, then, however depraved, lost, and abandoned, and however
        destitute of the aid of the written law, are, notwithstanding, a law to
        themselves, having the law written in their hearts. They have still
        sufficient light to discern between good and evil, virtue and vice,
        honesty and dishonesty; and their conscience enables them sufficiently
        to make that distinction, whether before committing sin, or in the
        commission of it, or after they have committed it. Besides this, remorse
        on account of their crimes reminds them that there is a God, a Judge
        before whom they must appear to render account to Him of their actions.
        They are, then, a law to themselves; they have the work of the law
        written in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the knowledge of the revealed law of God has not been preserved in
        every nation, is, however, entirely to be attributed to human depravity;
        and if it was restored to one nation for the benefit of others, it must
        be ascribed to the goodness of God. The law of God, and the revelation
        respecting the Messiah, had been delivered to all men after the flood by
        Noah, who was a preacher of the everlasting righteousness, 2 Peter 2:5,
        which was to be brought in, to answer the demands of that law. But all
        the nations of the earth had lost the remembrance of it, not liking to
        retain God in their knowledge. God again discovered it to the Jews in
        that written revelation with which they were favored. If it he asked,
        Why was the law vouchsafed in this manner to that nation and not also to
        the Gentiles? Paul explains this mystery, ch. 11: It is sufficient then
        to say that God has willed to make known, by this abandonment, how great
        and dreadful was the fall of the human race, and by that means one day
        to magnify the glory of the grace which He purposed to bestow on men by
        Jesus Christ. He willed to leave a great part of men a prey to Satan, to
        show how great is His abhorrence of sin, and how great was the wrath
        which our disobedience had kindled against the world. But why did He not
        also abandon the Jews? Because He chose to leave some ray of hope in the
        world, and it pleased Him to lay the foundation of redemption by His
        Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why was the greater part abandoned? Because then was the time of
        Divine wrath and justices and sin must be allowed to abound that grace
        might super abound. Why, in fine, choose the nation of the Jews rather
        than any other nation? Because, without any further reason, it was the
        sovereign good pleasure of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
        Christ, according to any gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse is to be construed in connection with the 12th, to the
        contents of which the three intermediate verses had given, in a
        parenthesis, the explanatory answers. In the day when God shall judge. —
        It is here assumed by the Apostle that God is the Judge of the world.
        This is a truth which nature and right reason teach. Since intelligent
        creatures are capable of obedience to law, it necessarily follows that
        they have a judge, for the law would be null and void if it were left as
        a dead letter, without a judge to put it in execution. And as there is a
        law common to the whole human race, it must also be admitted that there
        is a common Judge. Now this Judge of all can only be God, for it is only
        God who possesses all the qualifications for such an office. The Apostle
        likewise assumes that there will be a day when God will hold this
        judgment. This is also a truth conformable to right reason, for there
        must be a fired time for rendering public the decrees of justice,
        otherwise it would not be duly honored, since its honor consists in
        being recognized to be what it is before all creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, then, there were only individual judgments, either in this life or
        at death, justice would not be manifested as it ought to be. Hence it
        follows that there must be a public and solemn day in which God will
        execute judgment before the assembled universe. Besides, the Apostle
        here intimates that there will be an end to the duration of the world,
        and the succession of generations; for if there be a day appointed for a
        universal judgment, it follows that all men must there appear. And if
        such be the case, their number must also be determined, while, without a
        single exception, the time of their calling and of their life must
        terminate, so that the succession of generations must come to an end.
        The secrets of men. — It is not here meant that God will judge only
        their secrets, so that their public and known actions should pass
        without being judged; for there is nothing that God does not judge. But
        it is intended to show with what exactness the judgment will proceed,
        since it takes account of things the most secret and the most concealed.
        It will not resemble the judgment of men, which cannot fathom the hearts
        and thoughts. God will not only take cognizance of external, but also of
        internal actions, and will discover even the inmost thoughts of men. All
        actions, then, whether open or secret, will come into judgment; but
        secrets or hidden things are here said to be judged, because they are
        reached by no other judgment. If men can conceal their evil deeds, they
        are safe from human judgment. Not so with respect to the Judge at the
        great day. The most secret sins will then be manifested and punished. By
        Jesus Christ. — God will carry into effect that judgment by Jesus
        Christ. ‘He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world
        in righteousness by that man whom He hath ordained,’ Acts 17:31. Jesus
        Christ will conduct the judgment, not only as it respects believers, but
        also the wicked. If the secrets of men are to be brought into judgment,
        and if Jesus Christ is to be the Judge, He must be the Searcher of
        hearts, Acts 1:24; Revelation 2:23. He must then be truly God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the economy of Jesus Christ there are two extreme degrees, one of
        abasement, the other of exaltation. The lowest degree of His abasement
        was His death and burial. The opposite degree of His exaltation will be
        the last judgment. In the former He received the sentence which
        condemned Him, and which included in His condemnation the absolution of
        His people. In the latter He will pronounce the condemnation or
        absolution of all creatures. In the one, covered over with reproaches,
        and pierced with the arrows of Divine justice, He was exposed on the
        cross as a spectacle to the whole city of Jerusalem, when He cried, ‘My
        God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?’ In the other, arrayed in glory
        and majesty, He will appear before the whole universe, in the glory of
        His Father, who commands all the angels to worship Him. According to my
        Gospel. — Paul calls the Gospel his Gospel, not that he is the author of
        it, for it is solely from God; but to say that of it he is the minister
        and herald, — that it is the Gospel which he preached. The Gospel, in a
        large sense, includes everything revealed by Jesus Christ. The Judgment
        then shall take place according to the declarations therein contained.
