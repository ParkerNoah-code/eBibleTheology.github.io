      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        THROUGH the whole of the doctrinal part of this Epistle, Paul has an eye
        to the state and character of the Jewish nation, and the aspect which
        the Gospel bears towards them. In the preceding chapters, he had
        exhibited that righteousness which God has provided for men, all of whom
        are entirely divested of any righteousness of their own, ‘none being
        righteous, no, not one.’ He had discoursed largely on the justification
        and sanctification of believers, and now he proceeds to treat
        particularly of the doctrine of predestination, and to exhibit the
        sovereignty of God in His dealings both towards Jews and Gentiles. The
        way in which, in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters, he so
        particularly adverts to the present state and future destination of the
        Jews, in connection with what regards the Gentiles, furnishes the most
        ample opportunity for the illustration of this highly important subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the eighth chapter, the Apostle had declared the glorious and exalted
        privileges of the people of God. But it was impossible for one so
        ardently attached to his own nation, and so zealously concerned for the
        welfare of his countrymen, not to be touched with the melancholy
        contrast which naturally arose to his mind, as he turned from these
        lofty and cheering contemplations to consider the deplorable state of
        apostate Israel. If there was a people upon earth to whom, more than to
        another, the blessings of the Gospel belonged as a birthright, it was
        assuredly to the descendants, according to the flesh, of Abraham, of
        Isaac, and of Jacob. But they had willfully rebelled against their God;
        they had rejected the Messiah, and consequently forfeited the rights and
        immunities secured to their forefathers by covenant. Their condition was
        therefore itself well calculated to awaken the sympathies of Paul; while
        at the same time it was necessary to vindicate the faithfulness of God,
        and to prove that the rejection of the Jews was by no means opposed to
        the absolute security of God’s elect, on which he had been so largely
        expatiating. This subject is therefore discussed in the three following
        chapters; and as it is one of the greatest importance, so also it is
        introduced in a manner the most appropriate and the most affecting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely has his sublime conclusion to the eighth chapter terminated,
        when, at the beginning of the ninth, the triumphant language of victory
        is exchanged by the Apostle for the voice of commiseration, in which he
        bewails the apostasy of his countrymen. He does not dwell so much upon
        the magnitude of their guilt, as he does upon the memory of their
        ancestral glory and ancient privileges. He strongly affirms the ardor of
        his affection for them as his brethren, and feelingly deplores the
        misery of their rejected condition. Finally, he turns from this scene of
        ruin and degradation, to declare that their apostasy, though general,
        was not universal, and to predict the dawn of a brighter day, which
        shall yet make manifest the truth and faithfulness of their covenant
        God, whose purposes concerning Israel had evidently alike included their
        present rejection and future restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rejection of Israel, Paul proves to have been from the earliest
        periods of their history prefigured by God’s dealing towards them as a
        nation. For, after declaring that ‘they are not all Israel which are of
        Israel,’ he adduces various and conclusive testimonies in confirmation
        of this truth, and thus forcibly illustrates the conduct of God towards
        the natural descendants of Abraham. In following this course of
        argument, he draws a solemn and most impressive picture of the
        sovereignty of God in the general administration of His government, and
        asserts the distinction which God makes between vessels of wrath and
        vessels of mercy, in order ‘that He might make known the riches of His
        glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory.’
        He further affirms the calling of a portion both of Jews and Gentiles,
        with whom in combination he classes himself as one of those ‘called of
        God,’ concerning whom he had, in the preceding chapter, so largely
        discoursed. The introduction of the Gentiles into the Church of Christ,
        as well as of a remnant or portion of the Jews, being thus clearly
        intimated, he shows that both of these events had been expressly
        foretold by the Prophets, who had also affirmed that except the Lord of
        Sabbath had left them a seed, the national ruin of Israel would have
        been as complete as that of Sodom and Gomorrah.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle had thus two great objects in view. In the first place, he
        illustrates the sovereignty of God as exhibited in the infallible
        accomplishment of the Divine purposes predicted by the Prophets, which
        led to the national rejection of the Jews, with the exception of a
        remnant who were saved by grace. In the second place, he proves that the
        poses of God were equally fulfilled in bringing in the Gentiles; and
        this he does in such a way as to cut off, on their part, all pretensions
        to everything like merit, desert, or worthiness, since, without seeking
        for it, they attained to the righteousness which is of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having established these two important truths with great force and
        clearness, Paul accounts for the fact of the Jews having stumbled at and
        rejected the Messiah. He shows that the Messiah had been characterized
        by the Prophets as ‘that stumbling stone’ which God had laid in Zion;
        and that the Jews stumbled in consequence of their ignorance of the
        righteousness which God had provided in the fulfillment of His violated
        law, and of their vain attempt to establish a righteousness of their
        own.
      </p>
      <p>
        His discussion of this topic is thus most appropriately introduced. It
        is also in the last degree important, as furnishing additional
        confirmation of the sovereignty of God, which is here exhibited in the
        certainty of the accomplishment of His purposes; while it is testified
        how well merited was that punishment of rejecting and casting off the
        great body of the Jews. Paul sums up the whole, by appealing, at the end
        of the tenth chapter, to the testimonies of Moses and Isaiah, in
        confirmation of what he had advanced. But still, as the apostasy was so
        general, it might be concluded that God had for ever cast off the Jewish
        nation, and had thus made void the promises made to the fathers. This
        error he once more encounters and largely confutes in the eleventh
        chapter, where he shows most conclusively that, in whatever form it
        presents itself, it cannot abide the test of truth. So far is this from
        being the case, that, in the infallible dispensations of God, a period
        will arrive when the Redeemer shall come out of Zion, and turn away
        ungodliness from Jacob; when the whole of Israel shall, as one people,
        be brought within the bond of that new covenant established with the
        house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, of the blessings of which
        they shall all partake. The three following chapters thus hold a very
        distinguished place in this most instructive Epistle, and exhibit in a
        manner the most comprehensive, as well as conspicuous and edifying, the
        sovereignty of God in the government of the world, and the character of
        His dealings towards men in the whole of the Divine administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the nation of Israel were types of the true Israel, and as their
        rejection might seem, as has been observed, to militate against the
        security of the people of God, it was necessary in this ninth chapter to
        enter fully upon the subject. It was, however, one sure to be highly
        offensive to the Jews; and therefore Paul introduces it in a manner
        calculated, as far as possible, to allay their prejudices against him,
        while at the same time he does not in this matter shun to declare the
        whole counsel of God, for the instruction of those to whom he wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
        After expressing the grief with which he contemplated his countrymen,
        without specifying its cause, he enumerates their distinguished
        privileges as a nation. He then adverts to their being rejected of God,
        though not directly mentioning it; and begins with observing that it
        could not be said that among them the word of God had taken none effect.
        God had promised to be a God to Abraham and to his seed; and although
        the greater part of Israel were now cast off, that promise had not
        failed. When God said to Abraham, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be called,’
        He intimated that the promise did not refer to all his children, but to
        a select number. Isaac was given to Abraham by the special promise of
        Jehovah; and further, in the case of Rebecca, one of her children was a
        child of promise, the other was not, and this was intimated before they
        were born. In order to silence all objections against this proceeding,
        as if the Almighty could be charged with injustice, Paul at once appeals
        to the sovereignty of God, who disposes of His creatures as to Him seems
        good. Especially he refers to what God had said to Moses, as recorded in
        the Scriptures, when He made all His goodness to pass before him, that
        He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy, — thus intimating that
        His favors were His own, and that in bestowing or withholding them there
        was no room for injustice. Against this view of God’s sovereignty, the
        pride of man, until subdued by grace, rises with rebellious violence;
        but such is its importance — such its tendency to abase the sinner and
        exalt the Savior — that Paul dwells on it in both its aspects, not only
        as exhibited in the exercise of mercy on whom He will, but also in
        hardening whom He will. In acting both in the one way and the other, he
        declares that God contemplates His own glory. This leads the Apostle
        immediately to the election of those whom God had prepared to be vessels
        of mercy, both from among the Jews and the Gentiles. These in reality
        were the only children of promise of whom Isaac was a type, Galatians
        4:28. On the other hand, the rejection of the great body of Israel, so
        far from being contrary to the Divine purpose, had been distinctly
        predicted by their own Prophets. He closes the chapter by showing that,
        while this rejection had taken place according to the counsel of God,
        its immediate occasion was the culpable ignorance and prejudice of the
        Jews themselves in seeking acceptance with God by their own
        righteousness, instead of submitting to the righteousness of God brought
        in by the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
        The manner in which Paul has treated the subject of this chapter,
        furnishes an opportunity of illustrating the doctrine of election to
        eternal life, to which, in the one preceding, he had traced up, as to
        their origin, all the privileges of believers in Christ. It likewise
        gives occasion to exhibit the sovereignty of God as all along displayed
        respecting the nation of Israel In this manner the astonishing fact is
        at the same time accounted for, that so great a portion of the Jews had
        rejected the promised Messiah, while a remnant among them at that time,
        as in every preceding age, acknowledged Him as their Lord. Mr. Stuart
        says that ‘with the eighth chapter concludes what may appropriately be
        termed the doctrine part of our Epistle.’ But if the sovereignty of God
        be a doctrine of Divine revelation, this assertion is evidently
        erroneous. Without the development of this important doctrine, which
        accounts for the fact of the election of some, and the rejection of
        others, the Epistle would not be complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
        bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        I say the truth. — The Jews regarded the Apostle Paul as their most
        determined enemy. What, therefore, he was about to declare concerning
        his great sorrow on account of the present state of his countrymen,
        would not easily procure from them credit. Yet it was a truth which he
        could affirm without hypocrisy, and with the greatest sincerity. In
        Christ. — Paul was speaking as one united to, and belonging to, Christ —
        acting as in His service. This is a most solemn asseveration, and
        implies that what he was affirming was as true as if Christ Himself had
        spoken it. A reference to Christ would have no weight with the Jews. It
        appears, therefore, that the Apostle adopted this solemn language
        chiefly with a view of impressing those whom he addresses with a
        conviction of his sincerity, and also to prove that what he was about to
        say respecting the rejection of the Jewish nation did not arise, as
        might be supposed, from any prejudice or dislike to his countrymen. I
        lie not. — this is a repetition, but not properly tautology. In certain
        situations an assertion may be frequently in substance repeated, as
        indicating the earnestness of the speaker. The Apostle dwells on the
        statement, and is not willing to leave it without producing the effect.
        My conscience also bearing me witness. — For the sincerity of his love
        for the Jewish nation, the Apostle appeals to his conscience. His
        countrymen and others might deem him their enemy: they might consider
        all his conduct towards them as influenced by hatred; but he had the
        testimony of his conscience to the contrary. In the holy Ghost. — He not
        only had the testimony of his conscience, but what precluded the
        possibility of his deceiving, he spoke in the Holy Ghost — he spoke by
        inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2, 3. — That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my
        heart (for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ) for my
        brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many interpretations have been given of this passage. Calvin supposes
        that Paul, actually in ‘a state of ecstasy,’ wished himself condemned in
        the place of his countrymen. ‘The additional sentence,’ he says, ‘proves
        the Apostle to be speaking not of temporal, but eternal death; and when
        he says from Christ, an allusion is made to the Greek word anathema,
        which means a separation from anything. Does not separation from Christ
        mean, being excluded from all hopes of salvation?’ Such a thing is
        impossible, and would be highly improper. This would do more than
        fulfill the demands of the law, — it would utterly go beyond the law,
        and would therefore be sinful; for all our affections ought to be
        regulated by the law of God. Some understand it of excommunication. But
        the Apostle could not be excommunicated by Christ, except for a cause
        which would exclude him from heaven, as well as from the church on
        earth. He could not be excommunicated without being guilty of some sin
        that manifested him to be an unbeliever. It is not possible that one
        speaking in the Holy Ghost could wish to be in such a state. Paul’s
        affection for his countrymen is here indeed expressed in very strong
        terms, but the meaning often ascribed to it is not for a moment to be
        admitted. That any one should desire to be eternally separated from
        Christ, and consequently punished with everlasting destruction from the
        presence of the Lord, is impossible. The law commands us to love our
        neighbor as ourselves, but not more than ourselves, which would be the
        case, if to promote his temporal or spiritual benefit we desired to be
        eternally miserable. It should also be recollected, that it is not only
        everlasting misery, but desperate and final enmity against God, that is
        comprised in Paul’s wish as it is generally understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        It represents him as loving the creature more than the Creator. But who
        could ever imagine that the desire of being eternally wicked, and of
        indulging everlasting hatred to God, could proceed from love to Christ,
        and be a proper manner of expressing zeal for His glory? It would be
        strange indeed if Paul, who had just been affirming, in a tone so
        triumphant, the impossibility of the combined efforts of creation to
        separate him from the love of Christ, should, the moment after, solemnly
        desire that this separation should take place, for the sake of any
        creature, however beloved.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the meaning of this passage, there are three observations
        to which it is of importance to attend. In the first place, it is the
        past, and not the present tense, which is employed in the original. What
        is rendered ‘I could wish,’ should be read in the past tense, ‘I was
        wishing, or did wish,’ referring to the Apostle’s state before his
        conversion. The second observation is, that the verb which in our
        version is translated ‘wish,’ would have been more correctly rendered in
        this place boast; ‘for I myself boasted, or made it my boast, to be
        separated from Christ.’ For this translation, which makes the Apostle’s
        meaning far more explicit, there is the most unquestionable authority.
        The third observation is, that the first part of the 3rd verse should be
        read in a parenthesis, as follows: ‘I have great heaviness and continual
        sorrow in my heart (for I myself made it my boast to be separated from
        Christ) for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.’ By the
        usual interpretation, the Apostle is understood to say, ‘I have great
        heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart,’ and without stating for
        whom or for what, to add, ‘I could wish that myself were accursed from
        Christ for my brethren.’ But it appears evident that these words, for my
        brethren, form the conclusion of the above expression, I have great
        heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. Paul had himself formerly
        made it his boast to be separated from Christ, rejecting Him as the
        Messiah; and to prove how much he sympathized with the situation of his
        countrymen, in the bosom of his lamentation over their fallen state, he
        appeals to his former experience, when, before his conversion, he had
        been in the same unbelief, and personally knew their deplorable
        condition. He also intimates his sorrow in such a manner as to show that
        he is far from glorying over them, having been himself as deeply guilty
        as they were; while, according to the doctrine he was inculcating, it
        was in no respect to be ascribed to his own merits that he was happily
        delivered from that awful condemnation in which, with grief, he beheld
        them now standing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul’s sorrow was for those whom he calls his brethren. This does not
        respect a spiritual relationship, as the term brethren so generally
        denotes in the New Testament, but natural relationship, as Paul here
        explains it when he adds, my kinsmen according to the flesh. His sorrow
        for them is the subject of his testimony, which, in a manner so solemn,
        he had confirmed in the preceding verse. Instead of glorying over their
        calamities and rejection, he forgot his own wrongs, and their cruel
        persecutions, in the inexpressible affliction with which he contemplated
        their obstinate unbelief with all its fatal consequences. In this we may
        discern a characteristic of a Christian. He who has no sorrow for the
        perishing state of sinners, and especially of his kindred, is not a
        Christian. No man can be a Christian who is unconcerned for the
        salvation of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the
        glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of
        God, and the promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here recognizes and enumerates the great external privileges
        belonging to the Jews, which aggravated his profound sorrow, on account
        of their rejection of the Messiah, and their consequent deplorable
        condition. Who are Israelites. — That is, the most honorable people on
        earth; the descendants of him who, as a prince, had power with God. They
        had the name, because that of Israel was given to Jacob their father by
        God, when vouchsafing so striking a pre-intimation of His future
        manifestation in the flesh. Adoption. — That is, the nation of Israel
        was a nation adopted by God as a type of the adoption of His children in
        Christ Jesus; and in that typical sense, in which they were the children
        of God as no other nation ever was, they are frequently spoken of in
        Scripture, Exodus 4:22; Jeremiah 31:9-20. In this way our Lord Himself
        recognizes them, when anticipating their rejection, He says, ‘The
        children of the kingdom shall be cast out,’ Matthew 8:12. Glory. — This
        most probably refers to the manifestation of the glory of God over the
        mercy-seat in the sanctuary.
      </p>
      <p>
        God, too, set His tabernacle among the Israelites, and walked among
        them, which was their peculiar glory, by which they were distinguished
        from all other nations, Deuteronomy 4:32-36 The glory of the Lord
        appeared in the cloud that went before them in he wilderness. It often
        filled the tabernacle and the temple. His house was the place of His
        glory. Covenants. — The covenant with Abraham, and the covenant at
        Sinai, in both of which they were interested, and all the solemn
        engagements which God had entered into with mankind, were lodged in
        their hands and committed to their custody. Giving of the law. — To them
        the law was given at Mount Sinai; and they were the only people on earth
        so distinguished by God. The service of God. — This refers to the
        tabernacle and temple service, or Mosaic institutions of worship. All
        other nations were left to their own superstitious inventions; the Jews
        alone had ordinances of worship from God. Promises. — The Jews had
        received the promises, both temporal and spiritual, especially those
        that related to the Messiah, Acts 2:39.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — Whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh,
        Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whose are the fathers. — The Jews numbered among their illustrious
        progenitors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with others to whom God had been
        pleased to manifest Himself in a manner so remarkable. Of whom, as
        concerning the flesh, Christ came. — This was the completion of all the
        privileges which the Apostle here enumerates. It was a signal honor to
        the Jewish nation, that the Messiah was by descent an Israelite.
        Concerning the flesh. — This declares that He was really a man having
        truly the human nature, and as a man of Jewish origin. At the same time
        it imports that He had another nature. Who is over all, God blessed for
        ever. — This is a most clear and unequivocal attestation of the Divine
        nature of our Lord Jesus Christ. Every engine of false criticism has
        been employed by those who are desirous to evade the obvious meaning of
        this decisive testimony to the Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ; but
        they have never even plausibly succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The awful blindness and obstinacy of Arians and Socinians in their
        explanations, or rather perversions, of the word of God, are in nothing
        more obvious than in their attempts to evade the meaning of this
        celebrated testimony to the Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ. They often
        shelter themselves under various readings; but here they have no tenable
        ground for an evasion of this kind. Yet, strange to say, some of them
        have, without the authority of manuscripts, altered the original, in
        order that it may suit their purpose. There is no difficulty in the
        words — no intricacy in the construction; yet, by a forced construction
        and an unnatural punctuation, they have endeavored to turn away this
        testimony from its obvious import. Contrary to the genius and idiom of
        the Greek — contrary to all the usual rules of interpreting language, as
        has often been incontrovertibly shown — they substitute ‘God be
        blessed,’ for ‘God be blessed for ever;’ or, ‘God, who is over all, be
        blessed,’ instead of, ‘who is over all, God blessed for ever.’ Such
        tortuous explanations are not only rejected by a sound interpretation of
        the original, but manifest themselves to be unnatural, even to the most
        illiterate who exercise an unprejudiced Judgment. The Scriptures have
        many real difficulties, which are calculated to try or to increase the
        faith and patience of the Christian, and are evidently designed to
        enlarge his acquaintance with the word of God, by obliging him more
        diligently to search into them, and place his dependence on the Spirit
        of all truth. But when language so clear as in the present passage is
        perverted, to avoid recognizing the obvious truth contained in the
        Divine testimony, it more fully manifests the depravity of human nature,
        and the rooted enmity of the carnal mind against God, than the grossest
        works of the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        After speaking of the Messiah’s coming through the nation of Israel, in
        respect to His human nature, the Apostle, in order to enhance the
        greatness of this extraordinary distinction conferred upon it, here
        refers to His Divine nature, to union with which, in one person, His
        human nature was exalted. The declaration of His coming in the flesh
        clearly imports, as has been remarked, that Christ had another nature.
        When it is said, John 4:3, that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh —
        which could not be said of a mere man, who could come in no other way —
        it shows that He might have come in another way, and therefore implies
        His pre-existence, which is asserted in a variety of passages of
        Scripture. Of such passages there are four orders. The first order
        consists of those where His incarnation is ascribed to Himself. ‘Behold,
        I will send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and
        the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple,’ Malachi 3:1.
        These words manifestly prove that His incarnation, and the preparation
        for it, such as the mission of John the Baptist, was a work of the
        Messiah Himself, and consequently that He existed before His
        incarnation. The same truth is declared, when it is said, ‘For as much,
        then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself
        took part of the same; for verily He took not on Him the nature of
        angels; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham,’ Hebrews 2:14,16. Here
        His taking upon Him flesh and blood is represented to be by an act of
        His own will. The same truth is taught where He is introduced as
        addressing the Father in these terms. ‘Sacrifice and offering Thou
        wouldst not, but a body hast Thou prepared me: in burnt-offerings and
        sacrifices for sin Thou hast had no pleasure: then said I, Lo, I come
        (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do Thy will, O God,’
        Hebrews 10:5,7; and again, ‘Jesus Christ, being in the form of God,
        thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made Himself of no
        reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant,’ Philippians 2:6.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we are taught that Jesus Christ Himself took this form, and
        consequently existed before He took it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second order of passages, asserting the pre-existence of our Lord,
        are those which expressly declare that Jesus Christ was in heaven before
        He came into the world. ‘No man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that
        came down from heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in heaven.’ And a
        little after, ‘He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
        earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: He that cometh from heaven
        is above all,’ John 3:13-31. ‘The bread of God is He which cometh down
        from heaven,’ John 6:33,41,50,51,58. ‘For I came down from heaven, not
        to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me,’ John 6:38. ‘What
        and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before? ‘ John
        6:62. ‘And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own self with the
        glory which I had with Thee before the world was,’ John 17:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third order of passages ascribes actions to Jesus Christ before His
        birth. ‘By whom,’ says the Apostle, God ‘made the worlds,’ Hebrews 1:2,
        which signifies the creation of the universe; and verse 3, ‘upholding
        all things by the word of His power,’ which signifies His providence;
        and verse 10, ‘And Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation
        of the earth; and the heavens are the works of Thine hands.’ This is
        part of the response of the Father in the <19A225> 25th verse of the
        102nd Psalm to His Son, complaining that He had weakened His strength in
        the way, and praying not to be taken away in the midst of His days; to
        which the Father immediately answers, ‘Thy years are throughout all
        generations,’ and continues His reply to the end of the Psalm. ‘One Lord
        Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,’ 1 Corinthians 8:6, which implies
        both creation and preservation. ‘Who is the image of the invisible God,
        the firstborn of every creature; for by Him were all things created that
        are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether
        they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things
        were created by Him, and for Him; and He is before all things, and by
        Him all things consist,’ Colossians 1:15,16. Here Jesus Christ is
        declared to be the Creator of all things. This is also affirmed
        concerning Him before His incarnation, John 1:3. ‘Being put to death in
        the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit; by which also He went and
        preached unto the spirits in prison,’ 1 Peter 3:19. The Son of God
        preached by His Spirit to the inhabitants of the earth before the flood,
        who are now in the prison of hell, which supposes His existence before
        He was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fourth order of passages clearly proves the pre-existence of our Lord
        Jesus Christ. ‘This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man, which
        is preferred before me; for He was before me,’ John 1:15,30. He could
        not be before John unless He had existed prior to his birth, since John
        was born before Him. ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham
        was, I am,’ John 8:58. ‘But thou, Bethlehem-Ephratah, though thou be
        little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth
        unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from
        of old, from everlasting,’ Micah 5:2. ‘I am Alpha and Omega, the
        beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and
        which is to come, the Almighty.’ ‘I am Alpha and Omega, the first and
        the last.’ ‘I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first
        and the last,’ Revelation 1:8-11, 22:13.
      </p>
      <p>
        To all these passages must be added that of Proverbs 8:(compared with 1
        Corinthians 1:24), where Wisdom is declared to have existed when God
        formed the universe; and also John 1:1, ‘In the beginning was the Word,
        and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.’ Than this last passage
        nothing could more explicitly declare the pre-existence and Godhead of
        our Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are few of the predictions concerning the Messiah in which His two
        natures are not marked. In the first of them, ‘the seed of the woman’
        denotes His humanity; while the words, ‘He shall bruise thy head,’
        declare His divinity. In the promise to Abraham, His humanity is marked
        by the words, ‘in thy seed;’ while in what follows, ‘shall all the
        nations of the earth be blessed,’ we read His divinity. ‘I know that my
        Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the
        earth’ — this is His divinity. ‘Whom I shall see for myself, and mine
        eyes shall behold’ — this is His humanity. ‘Behold, a virgin shall
        conceive, and bear a son’ — this is His humanity; ‘and shall call His
        name Immanuel’ — this is His divinity. ‘Unto us a child is born, unto us
        a son is given’ — this marks His humanity. ‘The government shall be upon
        His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The
        Mighty God, the Everlasting Father’ — these words denote His Godhead.
        There are multitudes of other passages in the Prophets to the same
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same way the two natures of Jesus Christ are spoken of in
        numerous passages in the New Testament. ‘The Word was God,’ and ‘The
        Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.’ ‘Made of the seed of David
        according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power,
        according to the Spirit of holiness.’ ‘God was manifest in the flesh.’
        The same distinction appeared in His actions, and almost all His
        miracles. Finally, this truth discovers itself in all the most
        remarkable parts of His economy. In His birth He is laid in a manger as
        a man, but it is announced by the hallelujahs of angels, and the ‘wise
        men,’ led by a star, come to adore Him as God. At the commencement of
        His public ministry He is baptized in water, but the heavens open to
        Him, and the Father proclaims from heaven, ‘This is My beloved Son, in
        whom I am well pleased.’ In His temptation in the desert He suffers
        hunger and thirst, but angels come and minister to their Lord. In the
        garden of Gethsemane He seems as if he were ready to sink under the
        agonies He endures; but more than twelve legions of the angelic host
        stand ready to fulfill His mandates, and prostrate His enemies in the
        dust. In His death He hangs like a malefactor upon the cross, but as
        Jehovah He bestows paradise upon the dying robber.
      </p>
      <p>
        In completing the enumeration of the signal honors conferred on the
        nation of Israel, after having declared that of them the Messiah, as
        concerning the flesh, came, the reason is obvious why the Apostle
        immediately referred to our Lord’s Divine nature. Had he spoken only of
        Christ’s coming in the flesh, it would not have enhanced as he intended
        the high and unparalleled privileges by which his countrymen had been
        distinguished. It was necessary, both for this end, and in order fully
        to portray the character of Him of whom he spoke, to subjoin, ‘who is
        over all, God blessed for ever.’
      </p>
      <p>
        This addition, then, is not superfluous, or that might have been
        omitted. It is indispensable, being essential to the Apostle’s argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this great truth respecting the coming of God manifest in the flesh,
        as the foundation on which the whole work of redemption rests, the
        Apostle subjoins, Amen . In the same way he adds Amen to the expression,
        ‘who is blessed for ever,’ Romans 1:25, applying it to the Creator. Amen
        signifies truth, stability, or is an affirmation, or expresses consent.
        In the New Testament Jesus Christ alone makes use of this term at the
        beginning of sentences, as a word of affirmation. In this sense it
        appears to be employed at the end of each of the four Gospels. In the
        Gospel of John only have we any record oŁ the Lord using this word more
        than once in the same sentence, Amen, amen, or Verily, verily. The Lord
        employs it again and again in His Sermon on the Mount, the purpose of
        which, it would seems was to impress on the minds of His hearers both
        the truth of what He said, and its importance. Luke, who records this
        term less frequent than the other evangelists, sometimes substitutes in
        place of it a simple affirmation, Luke 9:27; Matthew 16:28. Jesus, in
        addressing the seven churches of Asia, after dividing his glorious
        attributes and names amongst them, finally denominates Himself ‘the
        Amen,’ Revelation 3:14; and God is called the God Amen, Isaiah 65:16.
        The Apostle John, in his ascription of praise to the Redeemer, adds
        Amen, as he does in the contemplation of His second coming in glory to
        judge the world, Revelation 1:6,7; and also in closing the canon of
        Scripture, when he repeats the declaration of Jesus, that He will come
        quickly, and after his prayer that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
        may be with all the churches to which he writes, Revelation 22:20,21.
        The Lord Himself makes use of this term when He declares that He liveth,
        and was dead, and is alive for evermore, Revelation 1:8.
