      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        THE Apostle describes in this chapter the blessed accompaniments, the
        security, and the foundation of justification. This last branch of the
        subject is interwoven with an account of the entrance of sin and death
        into the world; while a parallel is drawn between the first and the
        second Adam in their opposite tendencies and influences. By the first
        came sin, condemnation, and death; by the second, righteousness,
        justification, and life. From this comparison, occasion is taken to show
        why God had made the promulgation of the written law to intervene
        betwixt the author of condemnation and the author of justification. On
        the one hand, the extent, the evil, and the demerit of sin, and the
        obstructions raised up by law and justice to man’s recovery, were thus
        made fully manifest; while, on the other hand, the superabundant riches
        of Divine grace, in its complete ascendancy and victory over them in the
        way of righteousness, were displayed to the greatest advantage, and with
        the fullest effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God,
        through our Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore. — This particle of inference draws its conclusion from the
        whole foregoing discussion concerning justification by faith, though it
        may have a more immediate reference to the nearest preceding context.
        The Apostle having fully proved that salvation is by grace, and that it
        is by faith, now shows the consequences of this doctrine. Justified by
        faith. — This expression is elliptical; faith must be understood as
        inclusive of its object. This is very usual in all cases where the thing
        elliptically expressed is frequently spoken of, and therefore
        sufficiently explained by the elliptical expression. It is not by faith,
        abstractly considered, that we are justified, nor even by faith in
        everything that God reveals. It is by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
        Even this phrase itself, namely, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, is
        still elliptical, and supposes the knowledge of what is to be believed
        with respect to Christ. It is not believing in His existence, but
        believing on Him as revealed in the Scriptures, in His person and work.
        In the same manner as we have the phrase, ‘justified by faith,’ we have
        the phrase, justified by the blood of Christ. As, in the former case,
        faith implies its object, so, in the latter, it is implied that we are
        justified by faith in the blood of Christ. The blood of Christ justifies
        by being the object of belief and of trust. We have peace with God. —
        This shows that all men, till they are justified, are at war with God,
        and that He is at war with them. But when they are justified by faith,
        the wrath of God, which abideth on those who believe not on His Son,
        John 3:36, is turned away, and they cease to be enemies to God. Thus
        peace, succeeding hostility, brings with it every blessing; for there is
        no middle place for the creature between the love and the wrath of God.
        This peace, then, arises from righteousness, — the imputation of the
        righteousness of God by which the believer is justified, — and is
        followed by a sense of peace obtained. While guilt remains in the
        conscience, enmity will also rankle in the heart; for so long as men
        look upon their sins as unpardoned, and on God as the avenger of their
        transgressions, they must regard Him as being to them a consuming fire.
        But when they view God in Christ reconciling them to Himself, not
        imputing their iniquities to them, peace, according to the measure of
        faith, is established in the conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This never can be experienced by going about to establish our own
        righteousness. If any man have peace in his conscience, it must flow
        from Christ’s righteousness — it must be the effect of that
        righteousness which God has ‘created,’ Isaiah 45:8; and of which the
        Spirit, when He comes, brings with Him the conviction, John 16:8.
        Resting on this righteousness, the believer beholds God at peace with
        him, perfectly reconciled. The belief of this satisfies his conscience,
        which, being purged by blood, Hebrews 9:14, he is freed from guilty
        fears, and reconciled to God. Through this sense of the pardon of sin,
        and of friendship with God, the peace of God, which passeth all
        understanding, keeps his heart and mind through Christ Jesus. The
        maintenance of this peace, by preserving the conscience free from guilt
        by continual application to the blood of Christ, is the main point in
        the believer’s walk with God and the powerful spring of His obedience.
        In the New Testament God is frequently denominated ‘the God of peace.’
        The Apostle prays that the Lord Himself may give His people peace by all
        means, and enjoins that the peace of God should rule in the hearts of
        believers, to which they are also called in one body, and that they
        should be thankful. Peace is the fruit of the Spirit; and the kingdom of
        God is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Through our
        Lord Jesus Christ. — Peace comes through the death of Jesus Christ. The
        faith, therefore, by which it is obtained, must refer to Him who made
        peace through the blood of His cross. He alone, as the one Mediator, can
        make peace between God, who is holy, and man, who is sinful. God has
        established three covenants, or three ways of communication with man.
        The first was the covenant of nature; the second, the covenant of the
        law; the third, the covenant of the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the first covenant, man, being in a state of innocence, needed no
        mediator. Under the second, there was a mediator simply of
        communication, and not of reconciliation, — a mediator as to the
        exterior, or a messenger who goes between two parties, a simple
        depository of words spoken on the one side of the other, without having
        any part in the interior or essence of the covenant, of which he was
        neither the founder nor the bond. Under the third covenant, Jesus Christ
        is a true mediator of reconciliation, who has produced a real peace
        between God and man, and is the founder of their mutual communion. ‘He
        is our peace.’ It is established by the new covenant in His hands, and
        is everlasting, being made through the blood of that everlasting
        covenant. ‘The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness’ sake,’ Isaiah
        42:21. ‘The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of
        righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever,’ Isaiah 32:17. This
        peace, then, is through Jesus Christ and His righteousness, which brings
        this quietness and assurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is the King of righteousness and Prince of Peace. In parting from His
        disciples before His death, He said, ‘These things have I spoken unto
        you, that in Me ye might have peace;’ and this peace He bequeathed to
        them. ‘Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you.’ When He met
        them again after His resurrection, His first salutation to them was,
        ‘Peace be unto you.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
        we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Believers have access into grace as well as peace. — The one is
        distinguished from the other. In what, then, do they differ? Peace
        denotes a particular blessing; access into grace, or a state of favor,
        implies general blessings, among which peace and all other privileges
        are included. And as they are justified by means of faith, and have
        peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ, so likewise it is through
        Him that they enter into this state of grace; for it is through Him they
        have access by one Spirit unto the Father, by that new and living way
        which He hath consecrated for them through the vail; that is to say, His
        flesh. They have access to a mercy-seat, to which they are invited to
        come freely; and boldness and access with confidence by the faith of
        Jesus — boldness to come to the throne of grace, and enter into the
        holiest by His blood. And as it is by Him they enter into this state of
        grace, so by Him they stand in it, accepted before God, 1 Peter 5:12;
        secured, according to His everlasting covenant, that they shall not be
        cast down; but that they are fixed in this state of perfect acceptance,
        conferred by sovereign grace, brought into it by unchangeable love, and
        kept in it by the power of a faithful God. ‘They shall be My people, and
        I will be their God.’ ‘I will not turn away from them to do them good;
        but I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from
        Me,’ Jeremiah 32:38,40. And rejoice. — This is an additional blessing.
        The word here translated rejoice signifies to glory or exult, and is the
        same that in the following verse is rendered ‘to glory.’ It may
        designate not only the excess of joy possessed by the soul in the
        contemplation of the future inheritance, but the language of triumph
        expressing this joy, which is properly meant by glorying. The Christian
        should speak nothing boastingly, so far as concerns himself; but he has
        no reason to conceal his sense of his high destination as a son of God,
        and an heir of glory. In this he ought to result, in this he ought to
        glory, — and, in obedience to His Lord’s command, to rejoice, because
        his name is written in heaven. The hope of eternal salvation through the
        grace of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot but produce joy; for as there can
        be no true joy without such a hope, so it carries with it the very
        essence of joy. Joy springing from faith is called the joy of faith,
        Philippians 1:25, and is made a distinguishing characteristic of the
        Christian, Philippians 3:3. ‘Where Christ is truly seen,’ says Luther,
        On the Galatians, p. 85, ‘there must needs be full and perfect joy in
        the Lord, with peace of conscience, which most certainly thus thinketh:
        — Although I am a sinner, by the law, and under condemnation of the law,
        yet I despair not, I die not, because Christ liveth, who is both my
        righteousness and my everlasting life. In that righteousness and life I
        have no sin, no fear, no sting of conscience, no care of death. I am
        indeed a sinner, as touching this present life, and the righteousness
        thereof, as the child of Adam; where the law accuseth me, death reigneth
        over me, and at length would devour me. But I have another righteousness
        and life above this life, which is Christ, the Son of God, who knoweth
        no sin nor death, but righteousness and life eternal; by whom this, my
        body, being dead, and brought into dust, shall be raised up again, and
        delivered from the bondage of the law, and sin, and shall be sanctified
        together with the Spirit.’ In the hope of the glory of God — This form
        of expression will equally apply to the glory that God bestows on His
        people, and to His own glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The view and enjoyment of God’s glory is the hope of believers. It is
        the glory that shall be revealed in them when they shall he glorified
        together in Christ — when they shall behold the glory which the Father
        hath given to the Son, and which the Son gives to them, John 17:22-24.
        Thus faith relies on the truth of what God has promised, and hope
        expects the enjoyment of it. This hope is full of rejoicing, because
        everything it looks for depends on the truth and faithfulness of a
        covenant God. There can be no failure on His part, and consequently on
        the believer’s no disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here it should be particularly observed, that before saying one word of
        the fruits Produced by the believer, the Apostle describes him as
        rejoicing in the hope of the glory of God. He represents him as drawing
        no motive of consolation but from a view of God in Christ, whom he has
        received as his Savior by faith; and this is the true source of his hope
        and joy. The disciples, after the day of Pentecost, as soon as they
        heard the word that Peter preached, gladly embraced it, and did eat
        their meat with gladness and singleness of heart. In the same way, when
        Christ was preached to them, the eunuch and the jailor rejoiced the
        moment they believed. This hope is indeed capable of confirmation; but
        if it has not its origin in Jesus Christ and His sacrifice alone, it is
        a false hope. As soon as a man believes the Gospel of Christ, he ought
        to imitate the faith of Abraham, and give glory to God, resting securely
        on the sure foundation which is the basis of the hope; and he never can
        acquire a different title to glory, than that of which he is in
        possession in the moment when he believes, although, as he grows in
        grace, he perceives it more distinctly. Paul, while he urges the
        brethren at Colosse to a higher degree of conformity, in many
        particulars, to the will of God, yet gives thanks to the Father, who had
        already made them meet for the inheritance of the saints in light,
        Colossians 1:12.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the state of the thief on the cross, and is so of every
        converted sinner, in the moment when he is united to Christ; for then he
        is justified by faith, and has peace with God. Christians are
        characterized as holding fast the beginning of their confidence, and the
        rejoicing of their hope, firm unto the end, Hebrews 3:6-15. The
        beginning of their confidence and hope of salvation rested wholly on the
        person and righteousness of Jesus Christ, the Surety of the new
        covenant. It is true that at the commencement of their new life, faith
        is often weak, and its object seen indistinctly. Love, and joy, and
        hope, cannot transcend the faith from which they flow. Hence the
        propriety of that prayer by all the disciples of Jesus, ‘Lord, increase
        our faith;’ hence also the necessity of using diligence in the work and
        labor of love, to the full assurance of hope unto the end, Hebrews 6:11.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — And not only so, but hope glory in tribulations also; knowing
        that tribulation worketh patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only does the believer rejoice in hope of future glory, but he
        rejoices even in tribulations. This rejoicing, however, is not in
        tribulations considered in themselves, but in their effects. It is only
        the knowledge of the effects of afflictions, and of their being
        appointed by his heavenly Father, that enables the Christian to rejoice
        in them. Being in themselves an evil, and not joyous but grievous, they
        would not otherwise be a matter of rejoicing, but of sorrow. But viewed
        as proceeding from his heavenly Father’s love, Hebrews 12:6; Revelation
        3:19, they are so far from depriving him of his joy, that they tend to
        increase it. The way to the cross was to his Savior the way to the
        crown, and he knows that through much tribulation he must enter into the
        kingdom of God, Acts 14:22.
      </p>
      <p>
        The greatest tribulations are among those things that work together for
        his good. God comforts him in the midst of his sorrows, 2 Corinthians
        1:4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tribulation, even death itself, which is numbered among his privileges,
        Corinthians 3:22, shall not separate him from the love of God, which is
        in Christ Jesus our Lord. The Apostle Peter addresses believers as
        greatly rejoicing in the hope of salvation, though now, if need be, they
        are in heaviness through manifold trials. Tribulation worketh or
        effecteth patience. — Christians should be well instructed on this
        point, and should have it continually in their eye: their happiness is
        greatly concerned in it. If they forget the end and tendency of
        afflictions, they will murmur like the Israelites. Patience is a habit
        of endurance; and Christian patience implies submission to the will of
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul says here that affliction worketh patience, and James 1:3, says
        that the trying of faith worketh patience. This proves that the
        afflictions of a Christian are intended as a trial of his faith. What by
        the one Apostle is called tribulation, is by the other called trial of
        faith. The effect of affliction is patience, a grace which is so
        necessary, as we are all naturally impatient and unwilling to submit
        unreservedly to the dispensations of God. Patience gives occasion to the
        exercise of the graces of the Spirit, and of submission under
        afflictions to the will of God.
      </p>
      <p>Ver. 4. — And patience, experience; and experience, hope.</p>
      <p>
        Experience. — The Greek word translated experience signifies trial or
        proof. Here it means proof; for trial may detect a hypocrite as well as
        a manifest saint. But proof implies that the trial has proved the
        genuineness of the tried person, and also of the faithfulness and
        support of God, which will enable us to overcome every difficulty. And
        proof worketh hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, when the genuineness of our profession is manifested by being
        proved, our hope of enjoying the glory promised to the genuine people of
        God is confirmed. Hope is here introduced a second time. This should be
        carefully noticed. At first, as we have seen, it springs solely from a
        view of the mediation and work of our Lord Jesus Christ. Here; it
        acquires a new force, from the proof the believer has of the reality of
        his union with the Savior, by his being filled with the fruits of
        righteousness which are by Jesus Christ. Thus the ‘good hope through
        grace’ must be produced solely by faith, and confirmed, not produced, by
        the fruits of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
        abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope maketh not ashamed. — This may import, either that hope will not be
        disappointed, or that hope will not allow us to be ashamed of its
        object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various passages speak of the believer as not being put to shame in the
        day of retribution; and the expression here is generally interpreted to
        signify that hope will not be disappointed, but will receive the object
        of its anticipation. This is an important truth; yet the Apostle may
        rather be understood as speaking of the usual effect of hope as
        exemplified in the life of a Christian; and that it is not the future
        effect of hope in believers, but its present effect, as it is the
        present effect of the other particulars mentioned, to which he refers.
        Besides, the primary signification of the word in the original is, not
        to disappoint, but to shame, put to shame, or make ashamed. Paul here
        evidently speaks of hope as a general principle, which, in every
        instance, and on all subjects, has this effect ascribed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is its nature, with regard to everything which is its object, to
        destroy shame, and excite to an open avowal, and even glorying in it,
        though it may be a thing of which others may be ashamed, and which is
        ridiculed in the world. The experience of every Christian confirms this
        view. When is he inclined to be ashamed of the Gospel? Not when his
        hopes are high, his faith unwavering, and his impressions of future
        glory strong. It is when His hopes fade and grow weak. Just in
        proportion as his hope is strong, will he make an open and a bold
        profession of the truth. Here, then, by a well-known figure, the
        assertion before us appears to import that, so far from being ashamed,
        believers glory and exult. Hope causes Christians, instead of being
        ashamed of Christ and His word (which without hope they would be), to
        glory and proclaim their prospects before the world, Galatians 6:14; 1
        Peter 1:6-8, 5:1; 1 John 3:2. They glory in the cross of Christ through
        hope. This shows the great importance of keeping our hope unclouded. If
        we suffer it to flag or grow faint, we shall be ashamed of it before
        men, to which, from the enmity of the world against the Gospel, there is
        much temptation. Accordingly, our blessed Lord, who knew what was in
        man, has in the most solemn and awful manner warned His disciples
        against it; and the Apostle Peter enjoins on believers to add to their
        faith virtue — courage to profess it. Because. — This casual particle
        may be understood to intimate the reason why hope makes not ashamed, or
        to give an additional reason why Christians are not ashamed. Agreeably
        to the latter interpretation, hope is one reason, and then another is
        subjoined; and certainly the love of God is a strong reason to prevent
        us from being ashamed of the Gospel. Love of God — This phrase in itself
        is ambiguous, and, according to the connection or other circumstances,
        it may be understood, in its different occurrences, to refer either to
        God’s love to us, or to our love to God, — two things which are entirely
        distinct. God’s love to us is in Himself; but the love lie pours into
        our hearts may signify either a sense of His love to us, or, as
        Augustine explains it, our love to Him. The use of language admits of
        the first of these meanings, which appears to be the true one; and it is
        certain that it contributes more to our consolation to have our minds
        fixed upon God’s love to us, than upon our love to God; while our hope
        does not depend on our love to God, but on our sense of His love to us.
        The connection, too, leads us to understand the phrase in the sense of
        God’s love to us. It connects with what follows, where the Apostle
        proceeds to prove God’s love to His people from the wonderful manner in
        which, as is said in the 8th verse, He commendeth His love towards us in
        the way He has acted in the gift of His Son, notwithstanding our
        unworthiness and enmity against Him. In the same way it is said, John
        3:16, ‘God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that
        whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
        life.’ It coincides, too, with such declarations as, ‘In this was
        manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent His
        only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.’ ‘We
        have known and believed the love of God to us,’ 1 John 4:9,16. We cannot
        be beforehand with God in love, and we must perceive His love to make us
        love Him. The first feeling of love springs up in the heart from a view
        of His grace and mercy to us in Jesus Christ. His love to us is the
        foundation of our love to God; and it is a view of His love that not
        only produces, but maintains and increases, our love to Him. ‘Thy love
        is better than wine.’ Poured out. — This refers to the abundant measure
        of the sense of the love of God to us, which is communicated to His
        people, and poured into their hearts, through all the faculties of their
        souls, moving and captivating their affections. By the Holy Ghost. — It
        is the Holy Ghost who pours out into the heart of the believer a sense
        of the love of God to him, fully convincing him of it, and witnessing
        this love to his spirit, Romans 8:16. This sense of the love of God
        never exists in the human heart till communicated by the Holy Ghost. All
        men naturally hate God, Romans 8:7; and it is only when they have a view
        of His love thus given by the promised Comforter, and behold His love in
        the gift of His Son, that they repent and love God. Given unto us. — The
        gift of the Holy Ghost, in His operation in the heart in His sanctifying
        influences, was not confined to Apostles and Evangelists, but is enjoyed
        in common by all the saints, in all of whom the Holy Spirit dwells, and
        who are habitations of God through the Spirit, Corinthians 3:16;
        Ephesians 2:22; Romans 8:9. Here we see that everything in us that is
        good is the effect of the Spirit of God. Man possesses by nature no holy
        disposition. The lowest degree of true humility, and godly sorrow for
        sin, and a sense of the love of God, and consequently our love to God,
        are not to be found in any of the children of Adam till they are
        enlightened by the Spirit through the knowledge of the Gospel, nor can
        they be maintained for one moment in the soul without His sacred
        influence. Though sinners should hear ten thousand times of the love of
        God in the gift of His Son, they are never properly affected by it, till
        the Holy Spirit enters into their hearts, and till love to Him is
        produced by the truth through the Spirit. Here also we may see the
        distinct work of the Holy Spirit in the economy of redemption. Each of
        the persons of the Godhead sustains a peculiar office in the salvation
        of sinners, and it is the office of the Spirit to convert and sanctify
        those for whom Christ died.
      </p>
      <p>
        What fullness and variety of instruction and consolation are contained
        in the first five verses of this chapter! The work of the Father, of the
        Son, and of the Holy Ghost is exhibited, all severally acting, as God
        alone can act, in the various parts of man’s salvation. The
        righteousness of God is imputed to the believer, who is therefore
        justified, and pronounced by the Judge of all the earth righteous. As
        righteous, he has peace with God, and free access to Him through Jesus
        Christ; and being thus introduced into the favor of God, he stands in a
        justified state, rejoicing in hope of future glory. Being justified, he
        is also sanctified, and enabled to glory even in present afflictions. He
        enjoys the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, through whose Divine influence
        the love of God is infused into his soul. Here, then, are the peace, the
        joy, the triumph of the Christian. Here are faith, hope, and love, the
        three regulators of the Christian’s life. Faith is the great and only
        means of obtaining every privilege, because it unites the soul to
        Christ, and receives all out of His fullness. Hope cheers the believer
        in his passage through this world, with the expectation of promised
        blessings to be accomplished in future glory, and is thus the anchor of
        the soul, both sure and steadfast, which holds it firm, and enables it
        to ride out all the storms and troubles of life. Love is the renewal of
        the image of God in the soul, and the true principle of obedience. ‘The
        end of the commandment is love, out of a pure heart, and of a good
        conscience, and of faith unfeigned.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is thus the root of the whole. Faith in the resurrection of Christ
        produces a good conscience, 1 Peter 3:21; the conscience being
        discharged from guilt, the heart is purified; and from the heart when
        purified proceeds love. Thus faith purifies the heart, Acts 15:9; faith
        works by love, Galatians 5:6. Faith overcomes the world,1 John 5:4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
        for the ungodly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For. — This introduces the proof of the love of God to us, not a reason
        why the hope of the Christian will not disappoints him. Having spoken of
        the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, the Apostle here declares the
        evidence of this love. Though the Holy Ghost inspires our love to God,
        yet in doing so He shows us the grounds on which it rests, or the
        reasons why it should exist. In making us love God, He makes us perceive
        the grounds on which we ought to love Him. This also shows us another
        important fact, namely, that the Holy Spirit works in His people
        according to their constitution or the nature that He has given them;
        and, in endowing us with proper feelings and affections, He discovers to
        us the proper objects towards which they ought to be excited. The word
        of God through the Spirit, both in conversion and growth of grace, acts
        according to the original constitution that God has been pleased to
        bestow on the Christians. Without strength. — Christ died for us while
        we were unable to obey Him, and without ability to save ourselves. This
        weakness or inability is no doubt sinful; but it is our inability, not
        our guilt, that the Apostle here designates. When we were unable to keep
        the law of God, or do anythingtowards our deliverance from Divine wrath,
        Christ interposed, and died for those whom He came to redeem. In due
        time. — At the time appointed of the Father, Galatians 4:2,4.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fruits of the earth are gathered in their season; so in His season,
        that is, at the time appointed, Christ died for us, 1 Timothy 2:6. For
        the ungodly. — Christ died for us, considered as ungodly, and without
        His gift of Himself we must have for ever continued to be so. It was not
        then for those who were in some degree godly, or disposed in some
        measure to do the will of God, that Christ died. There are none of this
        character by nature. It is by faith in His death that any are made
        godly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 7. — For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet
        peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
      </p>
      <p>
        For. — This brings into view a fact that heightens and illustrates the
        love of God to sinners. A righteous or just man. — A just man is
        distinguished here from a good or benevolent man. They are quite
        distinct characters among men. A just man is approved — a benevolent man
        is loved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely, however, would any one give his life for the former, yet
        perhaps some one might do so for the latter. Scarcely. — This furnishes
        the reason why the Apostle uses the word righteous or just, when he
        denies that any one would die in his stead, because he does not mean to
        make the denial universal. ‘Even.’ — This is designed to qualify the
        verb to die, not the verb to dare, though it stands immediately before
        it. It is not even dare, but dare even to die. This intimates that to
        die is a thing to which men are of all things most averse. It is the
        greatest trial of love, John 15:13. ‘Hereby perceive we the love of God,
        because He laid His life down for us,’ 1 John 3:16.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 8. — But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were
        yet sinners, Christ died for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        His love. — Here God’s love to us is distinguished in the original as
        His own love, which in this place takes away all ambiguity from the
        expression. Yet sinners. — This is literally true with respect to all
        who are saved since Christ’s death, and is substantially true of all who
        were saved before it. This may be said of Abel as well as of Paul.
        Christ died for him as a sinner. It was Christ’s death through which
        Abel was accepted. For us. — Not for us as including all men, but for
        those believers and himself whom the Apostle was addressing; and this
        equally applies to all believers, — to all who are or shall be in
        Christ. Christ’s death for us as sinners, in an astonishing manner,
        commends, manifests, or exhibits God’s love to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be
        saved from wrath through Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        If God’s love to us were such that Christ died for us when we were
        sinners, much more, when we are perfectly righteous through that death,
        He will save us from future punishment. The meaning of the expression
        much more in this verse, which is repeated in the 10th, 15th, and 17th
        verses, is not at first sight obvious in these different occurrences,
        since the things, which are compared to what follows, are complete in
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sense appears to be, that in using these expressions, the Apostle,
        though inspired, reasons on the common principles that commend
        themselves to the mind of man. Having stated one thing, he proceeds to
        state another as still more clear to our perception. Justified by His
        blood. — This shows that when we are said to be justified by faith,
        faith includes its object, and imports that we are not saved by faith as
        a virtue. It shows also that Christ’s death was not that of a mere
        witness to the truth which He declared, but that it was for sin, and in
        order that we should be saved from wrath through Him. All men are by
        nature the children of wrath; and without the death of Christ, and faith
        in Him, we must have continued in that awful condition. ‘He that
        believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
        on him.’ Dr. Macknight’s explanation of this verse is as follows: —
        ’Much more then being now allowed to live under the new covenant,
        through the shedding of His blood, we shall be saved from future
        punishment through Him, if we behave well under that covenant.’ In his
        note he adds: — ’Here justified by His blood means, that, in the view of
        Christ’s shedding His blood, Adam and Eve were respited from death, and,
        being allowed to live, be and they were placed under a new covenant, by
        which they might regain immortality. This is what is called
        justification of life, ’ 5:18. And this explanation follows naturally
        from what he gives as the meaning of the foregoing verse: — ’His own
        love to man, God hath raised above all human love because we being still
        sinners, Christ died for us, to procure us a temporary life on earth,
        under a better covenant than the first.’ On such interpretations it is
        unnecessary to remark. They contain statements the most unscriptural and
        heretical, exhibiting most deplorable ignorance. He supposes, too, that
        it is here implied that some are said to be justified who are not saved
        from wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is not the fact. Justification is spoken of as having taken
        place, and salvation as future, — not because any shall be punished who
        have been justified, but because the wrath spoken of is future. The
        salvation of the Christian from wrath is said to be future, in reference
        to the time of the general execution of wrath in the day of judgment. It
        is evidently implied in the expression, that they who are justified
        shall never be punished. This expression, justified by His blood, gives
        a most awful view of the infinite evil of sin, of the strict justice of
        God, and of His faithfulness in carrying into execution the first
        sentence, ‘In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.’
        Without the shedding of His blood, and entering with it into the holy
        place, Christ could not have obtained eternal salvation for those who
        had sinned. On the other hand, what an astonishing view is thus
        presented of the love of God, who spared not His own Son, but delivered
        Him up for His people, and who with Him will freely give them all
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Divine wisdom is admirable in the manner in which the Scriptures are
        written. It is not without design that inspiration varies the
        phraseology respecting justification. Each variety is calculated to meet
        a different abuse of the doctrine. The human heart is so prone to
        self-righteousness, that the very doctrine of faith has been made to
        assume a legal sense. Faith is represented as a work; and the office
        assigned to it is not merely that of the medium of communicating
        righteousness, but it is made to stand itself for a certain value,
        either real or supposed. Had inspiration never varied the expressions,
        and always used the phrase justified by faith, though there would have
        been no real ground to conclude that faith is in itself the ground of
        justification, yet evidence to the contrary would not have been
        exhibited in the manner in which it is held forth by varying the
        diction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of ‘justified by faith,’ we here read justified by the blood of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shows that when we are said to be justified by faith, it is not by
        faith as a work of the law, but by faith as a medium, — that is, faith
        in the blood of Christ. To the same purpose, also, is the expression in
        the following verse, reconciled to God by the death of His Son. On the
        other hand, there are some who, strongly impressed with the great evil
        of making faith a work, have plunged into a contrary extreme, and are
        unwilling to look at the subject in any light but that in which it is
        represented in the phrase, ‘justified by His blood,’ as if justification
        were independent of faith, or as if faith were merely an accidental or
        unimportant thing in justification. This also is a great error. Faith is
        as necessary in justification as the sacrifice of Christ itself, but
        necessary for a different purpose. The blood of Christ is the price that
        has value in itself. Faith, which unites the soul to Christ, is the
        necessary medium, through the Divine appointment.
      </p>
      <p>Again, we have justified freely by grace, Romans 3:24.</p>
      <p>
        Self-righteousness is fruitful in expedients. It is difficult to put it
        to silence. It will admit that justification is by faith in its own
        legal sense, and that it is through Christ’s blood, as a general price
        for the sins of all men; but it holds that every man must do something
        to entitle him to the benefits of Christ’s sacrifice. Here, then, the
        phrase justification by grace comes in to cut off every evasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another variety of phraseology on this subject we have in the expression
        justified by Christ, Galatians 2:17. This points to the ground of our
        justification, or our union with Christ. We are accounted perfectly
        righteous, having paid the debt of sin, and having fulfilled the whole
        law, by our union or oneness with Christ, as we were sinners by our
        natural connection with Adam. It is of immense importance to the
        satisfaction of the mind of the believer, constantly and steadfastly to
        consider himself as a member of Christ — as truly a part of Him. He rose
        for our justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        When He was justified from the Sins which He took on Him by having
        suffered for them, and when He had fulfilled the law, we were justified
        in His justification. We are therefore said not merely to be pardoned,
        but to be justified, by Christ. We have suffered all the punishment due
        to our sins, and have kept every precept of the law, because He with
        whom we are one has done so. It is also worthy of remark that, while the
        Apostle speaks of being justified by Christ, he had in the preceding
        verse spoken of being justified by the faith of Christ. This shows that
        faith is the way in which our union with Christ is effected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
        the death by His Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by
        His life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enemies. — It greatly enhances the love of God that He gave His Son for
        us while we were yet His enemies. Had we discovered any symptoms of
        willingness to obey Him, or any degree of love to Him, His love to us
        would not have been so astonishing. But it is in this light only that
        the proud heart of man is willing to view his obligations to redeeming
        love. He will not look upon himself as totally depraved and helpless. He
        desires to do something on his part to induce God to begin His work in
        him by His Spirit. But Christ died for His people when they were the
        enemies of God, and He calls them to the knowledge of Himself when they
        are His enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, then, is the love of God. At the time when Christ died for us, we
        were not His friends, but His enemies. ‘The carnal mind is enmity
        against God.’ Reconciled to God by the death of His Son. — The word
        rendered ‘reconciled,’ signifies to change the state of matters between
        persons at variance, by removing their grounds of difference. The Divine
        word and declarations, as well as the Divine persecutions, forbid us to
        imagine that God will clear the guilty. In order, then, to
        reconciliation with God, satisfaction must be made to His justice. What
        is meant here, is not our laying aside our enmity to God, but God’s
        laying aside His enmity to us, on account of the death of His Son. It is
        true that we lay aside our enmity to God when we see that He has laid
        aside His enmity to us, and never till then will we do so; but what is
        here meant is, that God is reconciled to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Scripture this is spoken of as our being reconciled to God. We are
        reconciled to God, when He is pacified towards us through His Son, in
        whom we believe. This is quite agreeable to the use of the term in
        Scripture with respect to other cases, 1 Samuel 29:4; Matthew 5:23,24.
        Socinians, however, maintain that reconciliation between God and man
        consists only in bending and pacifying the heart of man towards God, and
        not in averting His just anger. This error, arising from their denial of
        the satisfaction made by Jesus Christ, is refuted by the consideration
        that God pardons our sins: whence it follows that He was angry with us;
        and the redemption of Jesus Christ is declared to be made by a
        propitiatory sacrifice, which clearly proves that God was angry. To this
        the idea of a sacrifice necessarily leads; for a sacrifice is offered to
        pacify God towards men, and not to reconcile men to God. Aaron was
        commanded to make an atonement for the congregation, for there was wrath
        gone out from the Lord. ‘And be stood between the living and the dead,
        and the plague was stayed,’ Numbers 16:46. God’s anger was thus turned
        away by making this atonement. In David’s time, by offering
        burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, the Lord was entreated for the
        land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. By this it is clear that
        the primarily intention of such sacrifices, and consequently of the
        priest who offered them, immediately respected the reconciliation of
        God. The same is evident from the following passages: — ’Thou hast
        forgiven the iniquity of The people; Thou hast covered all their sin.
        Selah. Thou hast taken away all Thy wrath; Thou hast turned from the
        fierceness of Thine anger,’ Psalm 85:2,3. ‘Though Thou wast angry with
        me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortedst me,’ Isaiah 12:1.
        ‘I will establish My covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am
        the Lord: that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open
        thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified (reconciled,
        Leviticus 8:15 16:20; 2 Chronicles 29:24) toward thee for all that thou
        hast done, saith the Lord God,’ Ezekiel 16:63.
      </p>
      <p>
        All men being sinners, are in themselves, while in unbelief, under the
        displeasure of God, who cannot look upon iniquity, Habakkuk 1:13, and
        are by nature children of wrath, or of the judgment of God; but as
        viewed in Christ, and in relation to His death, the elect are the
        objects of God’s everlasting love, and this love in His good time takes
        effect. He sends His Son to be a propitiatory sacrifice for them, — thus
        making satisfaction to His justice, and removing every obstacle to His
        being reconciled. He unites them to the Son of His love; and in Him,
        clothed with His righteousness, they become the children of God, and
        then in themselves the proper objects of His love. The ministry
        committed to the Apostles is called the ministry of reconciliation. Men
        are besought to be reconciled to God from the consideration of His
        having made Him to be sin for His people who knew no sin. Here is a
        double reconciliation, namely, of God to men, and of men to God. The
        latter is urged from the consideration of the former, and this
        consideration is effectual for all for whom the reconciliation was made.
        The whole of this reconciliation is through the death of His Son. Thus
        does God call His people with a holy calling. He invites them to
        friendship with Himself, through an all-sufficient atonement; and they
        lay aside their enmity to Him when they see that God has laid aside His
        anger against them. They are reconciled to Him through the death of His
        Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        What, in the preceding verse, is spoken of as the blood of Christ, is
        here spoken of as His death. These varied terms are useful to express
        the idea in such a manner that it cannot be innocently evaded. Christ’s
        blood was an atonement, as it was His death. This shows that no degree
        of suffering would have been sufficient as an atonement for our sins
        without the actual death of the sacrifice, according to the original
        sentence against man. Jesus Christ might have suffered all that He did
        suffer without a total extinction of life; but He must not only suffer,
        — He must also die. This phraseology, then, is calculated to meet the
        error of those Christians who, from a desire of magnifying the efficacy
        of the blood of Christ, have said that one drop of it would have been
        sufficient to save. Had one drop been sufficient, two drops would never
        have been shed. Much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His
        life. — If we were reconciled by His death, much more clear is it that
        we shall be saved by His life. Some find a difficulty in this, as if it
        implied that the atonement and price of redemption were not complete at
        the death of Christ. But the Apostle is not speaking on that point. He
        is speaking of the security of the believer from any danger, by Christ
        as alive. The meaning is, we shall be saved by Him as existing alive, or
        as living, Hebrews 7:25. We need Christ raised from the dead to
        intercede for our daily transgressions, and to save us from wrath. The
        efficacy of the death and the intercession of Jesus Christ have the same
        objects and the same extent, John 17:9. He intercedes for all those for
        whom He died. ‘It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again,
        who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for
        us,’ Romans 8:34. For us, that is, for those whom the Apostle is
        addressing as beloved of God, and called,, and saints, ch. 1:7, and all
        that are such.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two comparisons are made in this passage, one between the past and the
        present state of believers they were once the enemies, they are now the
        friends, of God. The other is between the past and the present condition
        of Christ: He was once dead, He is now alive. And the proposition that
        unites these two is, that reconciliation with God is entirely owing to
        the death of Christ as its meritorious cause. Since, then, the death of
        the Redeemer could produce so great an effect as the reconciliation to
        Himself of those who were the enemies of the Most High, what room can
        there be to doubt that the life of Christ is sufficient to accomplish
        what is less difficult; that is to say, to obtain the continuation of
        the Divine friendship and benevolence for those whose reconciliation has
        been already purchased at a price of such infinite cost? By the death
        which He suffered in their place, they are freed from condemnation, the
        rigor of the law having run its course, and received its execution by
        the punishment of their sins in Him; and thus they are saved from the
        effects of wrath. By His resurrection, His life, and His entrance into
        eternal glory, the reward reserved for His work as Mediator, they become
        partakers of that glory. ‘In My Fathers house are many mansions. I go to
        prepare a place for you.’ ‘Because I live, ye shall live also.’ ‘Father,
        I will that they also whom Thou hast given Me be with Me where I am,
        that they may behold My glory which Thou hast given Me.’ Thus Jesus
        Christ, who was delivered for the offenses of His people, was raised
        again for their justification; and this unparalleled love of God, who
        has not spared His well-beloved Son, is the surest foundation for the
        absolute and unlimited confidence in Him of every man who, renouncing
        his own righteousness, submits to His righteousness. At the same time,
        the necessity of the shedding of blood infinitely precious, in order to
        the justification of believers, is the strongest proof of the infinite
        evil of sin, and of the infinite holiness and awful justice of God. It
        shows the extreme difficulty there was in reconciling God to man, as it
        could only be done by a satisfaction to His justice, which could not be
        accomplished but by the death of His only-begotten Son.

      <p>
        Ver. 11. — And not only so, but we also joy in God, through our Lord
        Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse exhibits the last of those fruits which proceed from being
        brought into a state of justification. The first of them is peace with
        God, involving the communication and enjoyment of every blessing which
        the creature is capable of receiving; for if God be with us, who can be
        against us? and when this peace is known to be permanently established,
        immediately the cheering hope of future glory springs up in the mind.
        This hope, transporting the believer beyond this world, and looking
        forward to unbounded blessedness, enables him to bear up under those
        tribulations that are inseparable from his present state. In them,
        through not in themselves joyous but grievous, be even glories; and,
        experiencing their salutary effects, they confirm his hope of future and
        eternal enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Holy Ghost, too, sheds abroad the love of God in his heart; while
        his attention is directed to what God has done in giving for him His Son
        to the death, even while he was in the most determined state of
        hostility towards God. From the whole, the Apostle argues how much more
        it is evident that, being reconciled, he shall be saved from all the
        fearful effects of the wrath and displeasure of God against sin. The
        view of all of these unspeakable blessings conducts to that feeling of
        exultation and joy, with the declaration of which the enumeration is
        here terminated, of the effects which the knowledge of his justification
        in the sight of God, by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ,
        produces in the heart of the believer. Not only so. — That is, we shall
        not only escape the wrath to come, by the death of Christ, but attain to
        glory by His life. The measure of excess is future glory above mere
        exemption from misery. These two things are entirely distinct, and
        afford distinct grounds of thanksgiving. Joy in God. — The word here
        translated joy, is the same which in verse 2 is rendered rejoice, and in
        verse 3, glory. It was before declared that believers have peace with
        God, that they have access to Him, and that they rejoice in the hope of
        His glory. Now, the Apostle represents them as arrived at the
        fountain-head, looking through all the blessings conferred on them, and
        rejoicing, boasting, or glorying in God Himself as the source of them
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Christian’s joy is all in God. He exults in his prospects; but all
        are ascribed to God, and not to anything in Himself. God, even His own
        covenant-God, is the great and ultimate object of his joy. ‘My soul
        shall make her boast in the Lord.’ ‘O magnify the Lord with me, and let
        us exalt His name together.’ ‘I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in
        the God of my salvation.’ ‘The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance,
        my portion for ever. I will go unto the altar of God, unto God my
        exceeding joy.’ The sentiment of the love of God, in so great a
        salvation, and of joy in Him, is more deeply impressed upon the
        believer, by considering the rock from which he has been hewn, and the
        hole of the pit from which he has been dug. In the above verses, the
        former situation of those who are saved is declared in the strongest
        language. They wereWITHOUT STRENGTH, GODLY,SINNERS,UNDER WRATH,ENEMIES
        TO GOD. If such, then, was their original condition, what reason have
        they not only to rejoice in the hope of glory, but, above all, in the
        goodness and mercy of God, who has now reconciled them to Himself!
        Philippians 3:1, 4:4. Through our Lord Jesus Christ. — Joy in God, with
        all those unspeakable blessings above enumerated, are again and again
        declared to come by Him, through whom God manifests His loves and is
        reconciled to His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of Jesus Christ being here introduced so often, should be
        especially remarked. The Christian joys and glories in God only through
        Christ; without Christ, God could not be viewed as a friend. He must be
        an object of hatred. Our friendly relation to God is all through Christ.
        By whom we have now received the atonement, or reconciliation, according
        to the translation of the same word in the preceding verse. Atonement
        has been made through the death of Christ. The Apostle, and they whom he
        addressed, being believers, had received the atonement, which Christ has
        not only accomplished, but makes His people receive it. Among the
        various errors that have discovered themselves in modern times, few are
        more lamentable or dangerous than the views of the atonement that have
        been adopted by many. Instead of considering the atonement of Christ as
        a real compensation to the Divine justice for the sins of those who are
        saved, so that God may remain just, while He is merciful to the chief of
        sinners, many look on it as nothing but a mere exhibition of the
        displeasure of God against sin, intended for the honor and maintenance
        of His government of the universe. This altogether destroys the Gospel,
        and in reality leaves men exposed to the Divine justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is alleged by those who represent the atonement as only a expedient,
        subservient to the interests of morality, that sins are called debts
        merely in a figurative sense. But nothing can be more clear than that
        the Scriptures, which speak of sin as a debt, speak quite literally. The
        word debt extends to everything that justly demands an equivalent. We
        are said to be bought with the blood of Christ, as the price paid for
        our sins, which certainly implies that the blood of Christ is that which
        has given an equivalent to the justice of God, and made an atonement for
        those who, according to justice, must otherwise have suffered the
        penalty of sin, which is death. In the remission, then, of the sins of
        those who have received the atonement, God is at once the just God and
        the Savior, which He could not be without this atonement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reference to the sacrifice of Christ, by which He made the atonement,
        it is said, ‘Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood,’
        Revelation 5:9. ‘Without shedding of blood is no remission, for it is
        the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul,’ Hebrews 9:22;
        Leviticus 17:11. The blood is the life, Deuteronomy 12:23. It was the
        shedding, then, of the blood of Christ, which signifies His death, that
        procured this remission of sin. This was the ransom that God declared He
        had found, by which He saved His people from going down to destruction,
        Job 33:24. It was their redemption. Redemption signifies a purchasing
        back, and supposes an alienation of what is redeemed; and thus Christ
        redeemed them with His blood, which was the price He paid, and they are
        ‘His purchased possession.’ His blood was the ransom paid to the justice
        of God; without which it was impossible they should have been released
        from the bondage of Satan and the sentence of death. He died for the
        ungodly, who, being justified by His blood, shall be saved from wrath.
        The ransom, then, which Christ paid, was the price that Divine justice
        demanded; and, having made His soul an offering for sin, God has
        declared Himself ‘well pleased for His righteousness’ sake,’ He having
        ‘magnified the law, and made it honorable.’ It was necessary that He
        should yield obedience to its precepts, and suffer the penalty annexed
        to its violation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law condemned sinners to eternal death. In order, then, to redeem
        them, it behooved Him to suffer, and He did actually suffer, the full
        equivalent of that death by which He made atonement for sin, and through
        faith His people receive that atonement. His blood is put, by a usual
        figure of speech, for His death, in which His sufferings and His
        obedience terminated, and which was their consummation, containing a
        full answer to all the demands on His people, of law and justice. God,
        then, is now ‘faithful and just to forgive them their sins, and to
        cleanse them from all unrighteousness,’ 1 John 1:9. Believers have
        redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins, Ephesians
        1:7; Colossians 1:14.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye are bought with a price, 1 Corinthians 7:20-23. ‘Ye were not redeemed
        with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, from your vain
        conversation, received by tradition from your fathers; but with the
        precious blood of Christ,’ 1 Peter 1:18.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many who look on atonement as something real, yet overturn it by making
        it universal. This is an error which at once opposes the Scriptures, and
        could be of no service, even were it true. Where is the difference, as
        respects the Divine character, whether a man does not obtain pardon,
        from his sins not being atoned for by the blood of Christ, or because he
        has not been elected to eternal life? If Christ’s death pays the price
        of the sins of all men, all men must be saved. If His redemption be
        universal, then all are redeemed from the captivity of Satan and the
        guilt of sin, and delivered from wrath. For what can they be punished,
        if atonement has been made for their sins? If a man’s debts are paid,
        how can he afterwards be imprisoned for those debts? A just God cannot
        punish a second time for the same offense. If Christ has paid the debt
        of all sinners, there is nothing remaining to pay in the case of any
        man. Would it be just that any should be punished in hell for the sins
        for which Christ was punished on earth? If Christ bore the sins of all
        men in His own body on the tree, shall any man bear them a second time?
        Had the sins of all men been imputed to Christ, in that case His
        sacrifice did not answer its end. It left the greater part of them for
        whom it was offered under the curse of the broken law. But God, in
        appointing Christ to make atonement for sin, and Christ Himself, in
        undertaking to perform it, had in view from all eternity a certain
        select number of mankind, who were and still are known to God. For their
        salvation only was that atonement made, and for them it will be
        ultimately effectual. A Savior being provided for any of the lost
        children of Adam was an act of pure grace; and therefore the extent of
        this salvation depends solely on Him who worketh all things according to
        the counsel of His own evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Christ prayed not, John 17:9, so He died ‘not, for the world,’ but
        for those whom God had given Him out of the world. And all that the
        Father giveth Him shall come to Him. For those for whom He is the
        propitiation He is the Advocate, and for whom He died He makes
        intercession, and for no others. In Israel there were sacrifices
        accompanied with the burning of incense, but these were not for the
        world but for Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sin-offering, on the great day of atonement, was for Israel only. It
        was for Israel, whose sins were laid upon the scape-goat, that
        intercession was made; and when, after offering his sacrifice, the high
        priest came out from the holiest of all, it was Israel who received the
        blessing. Of whose redemption was the deliverance of Israel from Egypt a
        figure? For whose healing was the serpent lifted up in the wilderness?
        In one word, of whom was Israel a type? Not of all mankind, but only of
        the people of God. As, then, the high priest under the law offered
        sacrifice only for Israel, interceded only for then., and blessed them
        only, so Christ, the High Priest of our profession, has offered His
        sacrifice only for His people, for whom He intercedes on the ground of
        that sacrifice, and whom, in consequence of His sacrifice and
        intercession, He will at last come out of the heavenly sanctuary to
        bless, Matthew 25:34; thus discharging for them, and for them only, the
        three functions of the priestly office. His sacrifice and intercession,
        then, which are inseparable, are of the same extent, and for all for
        whom He offered His sacrifice He presents His intercession, which is
        founded upon it. Could it be supposed that He never intercedes for those
        for whom He gave the highest proof of His love in laying down His life?
      </p>
      <p>
        Did He bear in His own body on the tree the sins of those to whom at
        last He will profess, ‘I never knew you,’ and will leave them under the
        curse, saying, ‘Depart from Me, ye cursed,’ whose sins, as the Lamb of
        God, He had taken away, on account of which, notwithstanding, He will
        consign them to punishment everlasting? Far different is His language
        respecting those whom He calls His sheep, for whom He says He lays down
        His life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Them He professes to know, and declares that they know Him. ‘I am the
        Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As the Father
        knoweth Me, so know I the Father, and I lay down My life for the sheep.
        My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me, and I give
        unto them eternal life.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Witsius, in his Economy of the Covenants, observes: — ’That fictitious
        satisfaction for the reprobate and those who perish is altogether a vain
        and useless thing. For whom does it profit? Not certainly God, who by no
        act can be rendered happier than He is. Not Christ Himself, who, as He
        never seeks them, so He never receives them, for His peculiar property,
        and neither is He enriched by possessing them, though supposed to have
        purchased them at a dear rate. Not believers, who, content with their
        portion in God and in Christ, and fully redeemed by Christ, enjoy a
        happiness in every respect complete. In fine, not those that perish, who
        are constrained to satisfy in their own persons for their sins, to the
        uttermost farthing. The blood of Christ, says Remigius, formerly Bishop
        of Lyons, is a great price; such a price can in no respect be in vain
        and ineffectual, but rather is filled with the superabundant advantage
        arising from those blessings for which it is paid. Nay, the satisfaction
        of Christ for the reprobate had not only been useless, but highly
        unworthy both of God and of Christ. Unworthy of the wisdom, goodness,
        and justice of God, to exact and receive satisfaction from His most
        beloved Son for those whom He neither gave nor wanted to give His Son,
        and whom He decreed to consign to everlasting confinement to suffer in
        their own persons, according to the demerit of their crimes. Unworthy of
        Christ, to give His blood a price of redemption for those whom He had
        not in charge to redeem.’ ‘In respect of its intrinsic worth,’ says
        Brown of Haddington, ‘as the obedience and sufferings of a Divine
        person, Christ’s satisfaction is sufficient for the ransom of all
        mankind, and, being fulfilled in human nature, is equally suited to all
        their necessities. But in respect of His and His Father’s intention, it
        was paid and accepted instead of the elect, and to purchase their
        eternal happiness. Christ died for those only for whom He undertook,
        asSURETY, in the covenant of grace, in order to obtain their eternal
        salvation.’ Brown of Wamphray, in his Arguments against Universal
        Redemption, says: — ’All that Christ died for must certainly be saved.
        But all men shall not be saved. Christ’s death was a redemption, and we
        are said to be redeemed thereby. And therefore all such as He laid down
        this redemption or redemption-money for, must of necessity be redeemed
        and saved; and consequently He did not die for all, seeing all are not
        redeemed and saved. That all such for whom this redemption-money was
        paid, and this ransom was given, must be saved, is clear, otherwise it
        were no redemption; a ransom given for captives doth say that these
        captives, in law and justice, ought to be set at liberty. Christ’s
        intercession is really a presenting unto God the oblation made.
        Therefore, says the Apostle, Hebrews 9:24, that Christ is entered into
        heaven itself, to appear in the presence of God for us; and so, by
        appearing, He intercedeth, and His appearing in His own blood, whereby
        He obtained eternal redemption, Hebrews 9:12; and so His intercession
        must be for all for whom the oblation was made, and the eternal
        redemption was obtained.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Many suppose that in preaching the Gospel it is necessary to tell every
        man that Christ died for him, and that if Christ did not actually atone
        for the sins of every individual, the Gospel cannot be preached at all.
        But this is very erroneous. The Gospel declares that Christ died for the
        guilty, and that the most guilty who believe it shall be saved. ‘It is a
        faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
        into the world to save sinners,’ even the chief of sinners. The Gospel
        does not tell every individual to whom it is addressed, that Christ died
        for him, but that if he believes he shall be saved. This is a warrant to
        preach the Gospel unto all men; and it is only as he is a believer that
        it is known to any man that Christ died for him individually. To preach
        the Gospel then to every man, and call on every one to believe and be
        saved, is quite consistent, as it is a truth that whoever believes shall
        be saved. If the most guilty of the human race believe in Jesus, there
        is the most perfect certainty that he shall be saved. If any man is
        straitened in preaching the Gospel, and finds a difficulty in calling on
        all men to believe, except he can at the same time tell them that Christ
        died for every individual of the human race, he does not clearly
        understand what the Gospel is. It is the good news that Christ died for
        the most guilty that believe, not that He died for every individual,
        whether he believe or not. To the truth that every man shall be saved
        who believes, there is no exception. If there are any sins that will
        never be pardoned, they imply that the individuals guilty of them will
        never believe; for if they believe, they will be saved. Whatever, then,
        the sin against the Holy Ghost may be supposed to be, it implies final
        unbelief; and the best way to relieve those persons who may think they
        are guilty of this sin, is not to labor to make them understand what the
        sin against the Holy Ghost is, but to make them see that, if they now
        believe, they cannot have ever committed the unpardonable sin. To
        suppose that any believe who will not be saved, is to suppose a
        contradiction in the word of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difficulty of those who feel themselves restrained in exhorting
        sinners to believe the Gospel, on the ground that the atonement of
        Christ was not made for all, is the same as that which is experienced by
        some who, believing the doctrine of election, suppose it inconsistent to
        exhort all indiscriminately to believe the Gospel, since it is certain
        that they who are not chosen to eternal life will never be saved. In
        this they err. The Gospel, according to the commandment of the
        everlasting God, is to be made known to all nations for the obedience of
        faith. It is certain, however, that they for whom Christ did not die,
        and who do not belong to the election of grace, will not believe. These
        are secret things which belong to God, to be revealed in their proper
        time. But the Gospel is the fan in Christ’s hand, who, by means of it,
        will thoroughly purge His adore, separating those who are His sheep from
        the rest of the world lying in the wicked one. He has therefore
        commanded it to be preached to all men; and by it those will be
        discovered for whom His atonement was made, and whom God hath chosen
        from the foundation of the world, and predestinated unto the adoption of
        children by Jesus Christ unto Himself We are not, then, to inquire
        first, either for ourselves or others, for whom Christ died, and who are
        chosen to eternal life, before we determine to whom the Gospel is to be
        preached; but to preach it to all, with the assurance that whoever
        believes it shall receive the remission of sins. In believing it, we
        ascertain for ourselves that Christ bare our sins in His own body on the
        tree, and that God from the beginning hath chosen us to salvation,
        through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.

      <p>
        The atonement of Christ is of infinite value; and the reason why all men
        are not saved by it, is not for want of its being of sufficient value,
        but because it was not made for all. In itself, it was sufficient to
        make atonement for the sins of all mankind, had it been so intended. His
        sacrifice could not have been sufficient for any, if it had not been
        sufficient for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        An atonement of infinite value was necessary for every individual that
        shall be saved, and more could not be necessary for all the world. This
        intrinsic sufficiency of Christ’s sacrifice was doubtless in view in the
        Divine appointment concerning it. God made provision of such a sacrifice
        as was not only sufficient effectually to take away the sins of all the
        elect, but also sufficient to be laid before all mankind, in the
        dispensation of the Gospel. In the Gospel it was to be declared to all
        men, that in their nature the Son of God had made an atonement of
        infinite value, and brought in everlasting righteousness, which shall be
        upon all that believe. This atonement, then, being all-sufficient in
        itself, is proclaimed to all who hear the Gospel. All are invited to
        rely upon it for pardon and acceptance, as freely and fully as if they
        knew that God designed it for them from all eternity; and all who thus
        rely upon it shall experience the blessing of its efficacy and infinite
        value. In the proclamation of the Gospel, no restriction is held forth
        respecting election or reprobation. No difference is announced between
        one sinner and another. Without any distinction the call is addressed,
        and a gracious welcome proclaimed, to all the children of Adam. ‘Unto
        you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.’ And well might
        the Apostle say in his own name, and that of the believers whom he
        addresses in the passage before us, ‘We joy in God through our Lord
        Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.’ We come now
        to the second division of this chapter, from verse 12 to 19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having spoken of justification by faith, and having called our attention
        to several points connected with it, the Apostle now speaks of it as it
        was as figuratively exhibited in the condemnation of the human race in
        Adam. He first directs attention to the one man by whom sin was brought
        into the world, and declares that death came by sin. This necessarily
        imports that death is the lot of all that sin, and of none but such as
        are sinners. If death entered because of sin, it could affect none who
        were not guilty. But the Apostle does not leave this to be inferred,
        although this inference is both necessary and obvious. He draws it
        himself. ‘So death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned; ‘thus
        plainly asserting that all are sinners upon whom death passes. Every
        step in this process is natural and obvious. We may trace the very train
        in the Apostle’s mind. We may see the reason of every subjoined
        expression. Having said that all are sinners who die, it immediately
        occurs to him that to some this would appear strange; he proceeds,
        therefore, to show how all have sinned. This he does by observing that
        sin was in the world before the law of Moses, and that it had existed
        from Adam until the law was given. But this, as he observes, could not
        have been the case, had not law existed; ‘for sin is not imputed where
        there is no law.’ What, then, is the evidence that sin existed before
        the law of Moses? The evidence is, that death reigned. And what is the
        evidence that sin existed in infants? The evidence is, that death
        reigned over them. If death came upon man by sin, it could have no
        dominion over any of the human race who were not sinners. Adam is called
        the figure of Him that was to come; and this must not be confined to one
        or two particulars, but must extend to everything in which Christ’s seed
        are one with Him, as contrasted with everything in which Adam’s seed are
        one with him. If Christ’s seed are one with him in any characteristic
        point in which Adam’s seed are not one with him, then the ‘figure,’ or
        type, would fail. Having shown the similarity, the Apostle proceeds to
        show the dissimilarity, or the abounding of grace over what was lost in
        Adam. This he continues to the end of verse 19, summing up in the 18th
        and 19th verses what he had referred to in the 12th, from which he was
        led by the considerations above specified.
      </p>
      <p>
        In proceeding to analyze what is taught in verses 12-19, Mr. Stuart
        professes to feel great difficulty. Considering the lamentable manner in
        which he has perverted and misrepresented the whole passage, this is not
        at all surprising. In his Synopsis, he says, ‘As the consequences of
        Adam’s sin were extended to all men, so the consequences of Christ’s
        obedience (viz., unto death) are extended to all; i.e., Jesus and
        Gentiles, all come on an equal footing into the kingdom of Christ,’ p.
        196. And again he says, that verses 12-19 ‘are designed at once to
        confirm the statement made in ch. 3:23-30, and 4:10-19; i.e., to confirm
        the sentiment that Gentiles as well as Jews may rejoice in the
        reconciliation effected by Christ; while, at the same time, the whole
        representation serves very much to enhance the greatness of the
        blessings which Christ has procured for sinners by the contrast in which
        these blessings are placed,’ p. 198. There is here no reference at all
        to the distinction between Jews and Gentiles. The design is evidently to
        show the likeness between the way in which righteousness and life came,
        and the way in which condemnation and death came, the former by Christ,
        the latter by Adam. He adds, ‘I cannot perceive the particular design of
        introducing such a contrast in this place, unless it be to show the
        propriety and justice of extending the blessings of reconciliation to
        the Gentiles as well as to the Jews, and to set off to the best
        advantage the greatness of these blessings.’ But the extension of these
        blessings to the Gentiles, however important a truth, and however much
        dwelt on in other places, has nothing to do in this place, or with this
        contrast. The contrast here introduced is the same, whether the
        blessings are supposed to be confined to the Jews, or also extended to
        the Gentiles. The contrast is not between Jew and Gentile, but between
        Adam and Christ, between the way of condemnation and the way of
        justification. How does Mr. Stuart bring in the distinction between Jews
        and Gentiles? He might as well introduce it into the history of the
        creation. But the common view of the passage is quite in accordance with
        the preceding context. The difficulty he feels is a difficulty to
        reconcile it with his own unscriptural views of this part of the word of
        God.

        The following observations of President Edwards on the connection of
        this passage, in reference to the Commentary of Dr. Taylor, are equally
        applicable to the difficulties experienced respecting it by Mr. Stuart:
        — ’No wonder, when the Apostle is treating so fully and largely of our
        restoration, righteousness, and life by Christ, that he is led by it to
        consider our fall, sin, death, and ruin by Adam; and to observe wherein
        these two opposite heads of mankind agree, and wherein they differ, in
        the manner of conveyance of opposite influences and communications from
        each. Thus, if this place be understood, as it is used to be understood
        by orthodox divines, the whole stands in a natural, easy, and clear
        connection with the preceding part of the chapter, and all the former
        part of the Epistle; and in a plain agreement with the express design of
        all that the Apostle had been saying; and also in connection with the
        words last before spoken, as introduced by the two immediately preceding
        verses where he is speaking of our justification, reconciliation, and
        salvation by Christ; which leads the Apostle directly to observe how, on
        the contrary, we have sin and death by Adam. Taking this discourse of
        the Apostle in its true and plain sense, there is no need of great
        extent of learning, or depth of criticism, to find out the connection;
        but if it be understood in Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taylor’s sense, the plain scope and connection are wholly lost, and
        there was truly need of a skill in criticism, and art of discerning,
        beyond, or at least different from, that of former divines, and a
        faculty of seeing something afar off, which other men’s sight could not
        reach, in order to find out the connection.’ — Orig. Sin, p. 312. It
        would be well if those who will not receive the kingdom of God as little
        children, would employ their ‘skill in criticism, and art of
        discerning,’ on any other book than the Bible.
