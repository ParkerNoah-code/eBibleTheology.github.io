      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
        also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to
        admonish one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren. — The Apostle here
        intimates that the reason of his writing to the believers as he had done
        was, not that he considered them deficient in the Christian character,
        or uninstructed in the doctrines and duties of their profession; on the
        contrary, even he himself was persuaded concerning them that they were
        full of goodness. Mr. Stuart confines this to kindness. There is no
        reason why it should not be extended to goodness in general, of which
        kindness is a part. As we ought continually and prominently to maintain
        that there is naturally nothing good in men, we ought likewise to give
        equal prominence to the fact that all believers, being born of God and
        made new creatures, work the works of God, and in their minds possess
        those dispositions which are produced by the Spirit through the truth.
        In our flesh there is nothing good; but from the work of the Spirit on
        our hearts we may be full of goodness. The honor of this redounds to God
        as much as that of our faith. If faith is the gift of God, so ‘we are
        His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,’ to the praise
        of the glory of God. Filled with all knowledge. — Paul acknowledges that
        those to whom he wrote excelled in the knowledge of Divine things,
        though he wrote to them with respect both to truth and duty. The
        commendations bestowed by the Apostle on the attainments of this church
        show that there are comparative degrees in the knowledge of the Lord’s
        people, and also that it is proper, on fit occasions, to confer
        approbation and praise on those who excel in knowledge. It is mere
        worldly wisdom, not countenanced by Scripture doctrine and example, to
        withhold commendation when due, lest it should serve to puff up. Able
        also to admonish one another. — The word in the original signifies to
        put in mind of duty, especially when it is transgressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle undertook to admonish them; but this did not imply that he
        considered them as unfit to admonish one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto
        you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is
        given to me of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless. — Though the Roman Christians were eminent in their
        attainments, yet the Apostle thought it necessary to write to them as he
        had done with respect to some things, as to which he trusted they were
        previously acquainted. Such things he judged it right to bring again to
        their remembrance. It is proper, then, in the pastors of a church to
        bring forward the truths and duties with which the brethren are already
        acquainted, as well as those with respect to which they may either be
        ignorant or deficient in knowledge. Because of the grace that is given
        to me of God. — This was the ground of his boldness. He spoke as an
        Apostle, and in all things advanced by him he was only the mouth of the
        Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the
        Gentiles, ministering the Gospel of God, that the offering up of the
        Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ. — The grace of the
        apostleship was given to Paul in order to his being a minister of Christ
        to the Gentiles. Ministering the Gospel of God — The original word for
        ministry signifies to labor in a sacred office. Our term ministry
        sufficiently represents it. Calvin blames Erasmus for at first
        translating it in this way, and prefers to translate it ‘consecrating
        the Gospel.’ But this is evidently an improper translation, for Paul did
        not consecrate the Gospel. The Gospel is God’s word, and needs no
        consecration. Erasmus afterwards translated it, ‘sacrificing the
        Gospel,’ which is still worse. It is not the Gospel which is here
        represented as a figurative sacrifice, but the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behaviors are a sacrifice presented by the Apostle to God through the
        Gospel. The Gospel is the means by which the Gentiles are made a
        sacrifice. Mr. Stuart translates it, ‘performing the office of a priest
        in respect to the Gospel of God.’ But this is liable to the same
        objection. It is not in respect to the Gospel that Paul considers
        himself figuratively a priest. It is with respect to the sacrifice,
        namely, the believing Gentiles, who are fitted for presentation as a
        sacrifice by the Gospel. That the offering up of the Gentiles. — The
        Gentiles are the thing presented to God in this sacrifice. This, it is
        obvious, is a sacrifice only figuratively, just as prayer and praise are
        called sacrifices. There is now no sacrifice in the proper sense of the
        word, and the Apostles were not priests, except as all believers are
        priests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the errors of the Man of Sin arise from considering teachers
        under the New Testament as successors of the priests under the law. But
        there is now no priesthood, except in Christ, who abides a Priest for
        ever after the order of Melchisedec. The priests under the law of Moses
        were His types. As He is come, and has engrossed the whole duties of the
        office to Himself, He alone possesses priesthood. There is no longer any
        need of a typical priesthood; and the great sacrifice has been already
        offered. When the Apostles are spoken of as doing any part of the
        priest’s office, it is in a figurative sense. It is in the same sense
        that the altar is spoken of. As there is no sacrifice now to be offered,
        there is now no altar. To give the Lord’s table the name of an altar is
        very erroneous. It is wonderful to consider how, from the figurative use
        of a few words in the New Testament and in early Church history, a
        number of the grossest and most superstitious doctrines and practices,
        as has been already observed, arose in the Church. The bread of the
        Lord’s table at length became the body of Christ in a literal sense; the
        table on which it lay became the altar; the teachers became the priests
        who offered the sacrifice of the mass; and the contributions of
        Christians became offerings. In all these things, and innumerable
        others, the figurative sense has been, by a gross imagination and the
        artifice of Satan, turned into a literal sense, to the utter subversion
        of truth. Might be acceptable. — The Gentiles became an acceptable
        sacrifice to God only through the faith of the Gospel. It is only by the
        blood of Christ that sinners can be washed from sin, and only through
        faith in Christ that any sinner obtains an interest in Christ’s blood,
        and only through the Gospel that faith in Christ is produced. All those
        who attempt to come to God in any other way are unacceptable to Him.
        This cuts off the hope of all self-righteous persons, and of all
        unbelievers. It takes away, also, the foundation from the doctrine of
        those who teach that Christ may be the Savior of what they call pious
        heathens who have not heard of Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Apostle Paul, the offering of the Gentiles is
        acceptable only through the Gospel. Sanctified by the Holy Ghost. — As
        the sacrifices under the law were sanctified externally and typically,
        this figurative sacrifice is sanctified truly by the Holy Ghost. No
        person, then, can be acceptable to God who is not sanctified by His
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
        those things which pertain to God. l have therefore whereof I may glory.
        — Paul says on another occasion, ‘God forbid that I should glory, save
        in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.’ Is it not a contradiction, then,
        to say here, ‘I have whereof I may glory?’ There is no contradiction:
        The glorying which he disclaims respects his acceptance with God. The
        glorying which he here acknowledges respects his success in the
        preaching of the Gospel; and even this is not a glorying in himself, but
        a glorying in Christ Jesus. It was the signal favor of his Lord that
        gave him his office of apostleship, qualified him for its discharge, and
        made him successful. From all the Apostle’s writings, we learn that of
        this he had the most firm conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives thanks to the Lord, who had counted him faithful, putting him
        into the ministry. But elsewhere he declares that he had ‘obtained mercy
        of the Lord to be faithful.’ In like manner all that he did in His
        service is ascribed to God. ‘Whereunto I also labor, striving according
        to His working, which worketh in me mightily.’ He had whereof to glory
        in the abundant and unmerited favor of God; but he always carefully
        avoids speaking of anything done by him that was not the work of Christ.
        In things that pertain to God. — That is, things that respect the
        service of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
        Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word
        and deed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For I will not dare. — Paul would not take to himself any portion of
        praise on account of the labors and success of others. He spoke only of
        the success which Christ had given him in his own work. This shows that
        although all success is of God, yet that it is an honor and a ground of
        praise to be successful in Christ’s work. Many have supposed that it is
        wrong to give any praise to the Lord’s servants on account of their
        labors, diligence, and success in His service. They have judged that
        this encourages a spirit of self-righteousness and of pride. But this
        wisdom is not from God. It is human wisdom, and tends to damp exertion
        in the service of Jesus Christ. All our success is in Christ Jesus, as
        well as our ability and disposition to labor. Yet God has given praise
        to His servants for their diligence and success in His work. It is a
        sinful refinement to blame what God approves. The Apostle speaks here of
        what Christ wrought by him. In other places he also speaks of what God
        wrought by him, Acts 14:27, 15:12. To make the Gentiles obedient. — The
        obedience of the Gentiles is their belief of the Gospel. To obey the
        Gospel is to receive it, for it commands belief. Now this obedience of
        the Gentiles to the Gospel was Christ’s work. Christ wrought it. — Faith
        is the gift of God. It is not to be ascribed either to him that preaches
        or to him that hears, but to Christ, who by His Spirit opens the heart
        to believe the truth. But the preacher is employed as an agent. Christ
        wrought this through the Apostle. No man is made a Christian by any
        power less than God’s, and by no other means than God’s word. Christ
        wrought the obedience of the Gentiles through Paul, but the
        instrumentality belongs to God’s word, as well as the agency to Himself.
        Some connect this with the word immediately preceding, and understand it
        of the profession and practice of the believing Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others understand it of the preaching, labors, and miracles of the
        Apostles. The next verse seems to determine for the latter sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — Through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit
        of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have
        fully preached the Gospel of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through mighty signs and wonders. — Rather through, or by the power of,
        signs and miracles. These are the deeds through which, as well as by
        Paul’s preaching, the Lord made the Gentiles obedient. This includes all
        the miraculous works of the Apostle for the confirmation of the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the power of the Spirit of God. — Some understand this of the power
        by which the signs and wonders were performed; others, of the gifts of
        the Holy Spirit, or the gift of tongues, prophecy, etc. The latter
        opinion appears to be the true meaning. So that from Jerusalem. — Some
        suppose that, as there is no mention in the Acts of the Apostles of
        Paul’s preaching in Illyricum, and as it is only said that he preached
        as far as Illyricum, he did not enter that country. But the silence of
        the Acts of the Apostles is no evidence of this, and verse 23rd seems to
        prove that he did preach in Illyricum, as well as in the intermediate
        countries between that province and Jerusalem. If there was no place in
        those parts for him to extend his labors on unoccupied ground, he must
        have preached in Illyricum also. Besides, that the Gospel had been
        preached, and that there were churches in Illyricum, appears from Titus
        going into Dalmatia. I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ, or
        fulfilled the Gospel. — The Gospel was to be preached to all nations. He
        filled all the countries with the glad tidings of salvation through
        Jesus Christ. Thus was it given to Paul, who was before a blasphemer,
        and a persecutor, and injurious, to preach the unsearchable riches of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel, not where Christ
        was named lest I should build upon another man’s foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel. — The word translated
        strived literally signifies to love honor; and as the love of honor
        stimulates to earnest exertions, the word came to signify, in a
        secondary sense, to endeavor earnestly, to strive. In this place,
        however, the primary sense appears to be that of the Apostle. He is
        speaking of the honor which God had conferred on him in the labor and
        success of the Gospel; and consistently with this, he speaks of his
        ambition to occupy ground that had not been taken possession of by
        others. This is not indeed worldly ambition, but it is ambition which is
        lawful and commendable in Christians. Not where Christ was Named — That
        is, in places that had not previously even heard of Christ. Similar
        ambition has often stimulated modern missionaries, and by their labors
        the Gospel has been carried to countries that were previously strangers
        to the very name of Christ. This appears to show that when any are
        strongly inclined to have the honor of being the means of subjecting new
        countries to the authority of Christ, they ought to endeavor to
        accomplish their desire. It is through this means that God excites men
        to fulfill His purposes of mercy to the different nations of the earth.
        Lest I should build upon another man’s foundation — This determines the
        meaning of the word translated to strive in this place. The Apostle was
        desirous of laying the foundation of the building in as many countries
        as possible. This is more honorable than to go into countries where
        others have been successful. Dr. Macknight understands this reason to
        indicate reluctance to perform the office of a subordinate teacher. But
        he evidently mistakes Paul’s meaning. To teach believers converted by
        others is not necessarily to perform the office of a subordinate
        teacher. With respect to those of the church at some itself, Paul was
        not the first who taught them; and he doubtless preached in many places
        where Christ had been named.
      </p>
      <p>
        This he did not avoid, though he was ambitious, as far as possible, to
        break up new ground, and have the honor of preaching to men who had not
        previously heard of Christ. Calvin well observes, ‘There is no
        foundation for perverting this passage by applying it to the pastoral
        office; for we know that the name of Christ must always continue to be
        preached in well-regulated and properly constituted churches, when the
        truth of the Gospel has been for a long period felt and acknowledged.’
        He that lays the foundation has more honor than he that builds on it in
        the Christian’s edification, but the latter is not without his reward.
        All cannot have the honor, and therefore have not the ambition, to go as
        missionaries to heathen countries. He that waters shall have his own
        reward, as well as he that plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — But as it is written, To whom He was not spoken of, they
        shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as it is written. — This ambition of the Apostle was the means of
        fulfilling a prophecy with respect to the spread of the Gospel in
        heathen countries. Thus it is that God fulfills His predictions and His
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives His people an earnest desire to be the means of accomplishing
        them at the moment when He designs their accomplishment. It will be thus
        that the Gospel will at last be effectually carried to every country
        under heaven. It is thus that modern missionaries have, in some measure,
        carried the Gospel to the heathen. And although the slothfulness of the
        people of God in former ages is not without blame, it is because the
        time to fulfill God’s predictions to the nations was not come, that a
        like ambition to that of Paul was not found more generally to animate
        Christians. Whenever the Lord has work to do, He raises up men with a
        heart to perform it. This, however, is no excuse at any particular time
        for indifference or want of effort to spread the Gospel. To whom He was
        not spoken of; Isaiah 52:15. — This intimates the preaching of the
        Gospel to the heathens, and it proves also that the Messiah was spoken
        of to the Jews. The law and the Prophets spoke of Him.
