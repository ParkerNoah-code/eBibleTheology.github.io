      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 25. — For circumcisions verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but
        if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
        uncircumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here pursues the Jew into his last retreat, in which he imagined
        himself most secure. He presses him on the subject of circumcision,
        which the Jews viewed as their stronghold — that rite even more ancient
        than Moses, and by which they were distinguished from the other nations.
        The sum of this, and the following verses to the end of the chapter, is,
        that the Jews being such as the Apostle had represented them, all their
        advantages, including circumcision, could only enhance their
        condemnation before the tribunal of God, and that, on the contrary, if
        the Gentiles, who have not received the law, observed its precepts, they
        would be justified without circumcision. Two things are here to be
        observed, namely, what is asserted of the Jews and Gentiles, and the
        proof that follows. The assertions are, that circumcision serves only as
        a ground of condemnation to transgressors of the law; and, on the other
        hand, that the want of it would be no detriment to those who fulfilled
        the law. The proof is, that before God the true Jew and the true
        circumcision consist not in external qualities, but in internal and real
        holiness. The reason why circumcision was not included in the
        enumeration before given of the advantages of the Jews is, that in
        itself it is not an advantage, but only a sign of other advantages; and
        it is mentioned here, because, in the character of a sign, it includes
        them: to name circumcision then, is to refer to them all. In this verse
        the Apostle does not speak of circumcision according to its real and
        most important signification as he does in the two concluding verses,
        but in that view in which the Jews themselves considered it, as the
        initiatory and distinctive rite of their religion, without the
        observance of which they believed they could not be saved. Circumcision
        verily profiteth, if thou keep the law. — It is not meant that
        circumcision will come into the account before the tribunal of God, as
        the fulfilling of the law, but that it would be an aid and motive to the
        observance of the law, and viewed in the light of an obligation to keep
        the law; if the Jew had kept it, he could refer to his circumcision as
        an obligation which he had fulfilled. Circumcision may be viewed in two
        lights, either as given to Abraham, or as enjoined by Moses. 1. It was
        the token of the covenant that Abraham should be the father of the
        promised Savior, and, moreover, a seal or pledge of the introduction and
        reality of the righteousness imputed to him through faith, while
        uncircumcised, in order that he might be the father of all believers,
        whether circumcised or not, to whom that righteousness should also be
        imputed. 2. Circumcision, as enjoined by Moses, was a part of his law,
        John 7:22,23. In the first view, it was connected with all the
        privileges of Israel, Philippians 3:4,5; in the second, it was a part of
        the law, whose righteousness is described, Romans 10:5. f14 The Jews
        entirely mistook the object of the law, Romans 5:20, Galatians 3:19,
        which shut up all under sin, Galatians 3:22, by cursing every one who
        continued not in all things written in the book of the law to do them;
        and in this view, as a part of the law of Moses, circumcision could only
        profit those who kept the whole law. But instead of this, the name of
        God was blasphemed among the Gentiles, through the wickedness of the
        Jews, and hence their having the form of knowledge and of the truth in
        the law would only aggravate their condemnation. When, therefore, the
        Apostle says, if thou keep the law, he supposes a case, not implying
        that it was ever verified; but if it should exist, the result would be
        what is stated. If, on the other hand, the Jew was a breaker of the law,
        his circumcision was made uncircumcision, Jeremiah 9:26; it would be of
        no more avail than if he had not received it, and would give him no
        advantage over the uncircumcised Gentile. This declaration is similar to
        the way in which our Lord answers the rich young man. If the law is
        perfectly kept, eternal life will be the reward, as the Apostle had also
        said in verses 7 and 10; but if there be any breach of it, circumcision
        is of no value for salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 26. — Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of
        the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle does not mean to affirm that an uncircumcised Gentile can
        fulfill the righteousness of the law, nor does he here retract what he
        had said in the first chapter respecting the corruption and guilt of the
        Gentiles, but he supposes a case in regard to them like that concerning
        the Jews in the preceding verse. This hypothetical mode of reasoning is
        common with Paul, of which we have an example in this same chapter,
        where he says that the doers of the law shall be justified; of whom,
        however, in the conclusion of his argument, ch. 3:19, he affirms that
        none can be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        The supposition, then, as to the obedience of the Gentile, though in
        itself impossible, is made in order to prove that, before the judgment
        seat of God, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision enters at all into
        consideration for justification or condemnation. If an uncircumcised
        Gentile kept the law, his uncircumcision would avail as much as the
        circumcision of the Jew. The reason of this is, that the judgment of God
        regards only the observance or the violation of the law, and not
        extraneous advantages or disadvantages, and, as is said above, with God
        there is no respect of persons. In reality, then, the Jews and Gentiles
        were on a level as to the impossibility of salvation by the law; in
        confirmation of which truth, the inquiry here introduced is for the
        conviction of the Jew on this important point. But what is true upon a
        supposition never realized, is actually true with respect to all who
        believe in Jesus. In Him they have this righteousness which the law
        demands, and without circumcision have salvation. Dr. Macknight
        egregiously errs when he supposes that the law here referred to is the
        law of faith, which heathens may keep and be saved: this is a
        complication of errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2 7 — And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it
        fulfill the law judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost
        transgress the law ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul continues in this verse to reason on the same supposition as in the
        one preceding, and draws from it another consequence, which is, that if
        the Gentile who is uncircumcised fulfilled the law, he would not only be
        justified, notwithstanding his uncircumcision, but would judge and
        condemn the circumcised Jew who did not fulfill it. The reason of this
        conclusion is, that in the comparison between the one and the other, the
        case of the circumcised transgressor would appear much worse, because of
        the superior advantages he enjoyed. In the same way it is said, Matthew
        12:41, that the Ninevites shall condemn the Jews. The uncircumcision
        which is by nature. — That is to say, the Gentiles in their natural
        uncircumcised state, in opposition to the Jews, who had been
        distinguished and set apart by a particular calling of God. Dr.
        Macknight commits great violence when he joins the words ‘by nature’
        with the words ‘fulfill the law,’ as if it implied that some Gentiles
        did fulfill the law by the light of nature. Who by the letter and
        circumcision dost transgress the law. — Dr. Macknight affirms that the
        common translation here ‘is not sense.’ But it contains a very important
        meaning. The Jews transgressed the law by means of their covenant and
        circumcision being misunderstood by them. This fact is notoriously true:
        they were hardened in their sin from a false confidence in their
        relation to God. Instead of being led to the Savior by the law,
        according to its true end, they transgressed it, through their views of
        the letter of the law and of circumcision; of both of which, especially
        of circumcision, they made a savior. The fulfilling of the law and its
        transgression are here to be taken in their fullest import, namely, for
        an entire and complete fulfillment, and for the slightest transgression
        of the law; for the Apostle is speaking of the strict judgment of
        justice by the law, before which nothing can subsist but a perfect and
        uninterrupted fulfillment of all the commandments of God. But it may be
        asked how the uncircumcised Gentiles could fulfill the law which they
        had never received.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could not indeed fulfill it as written on tables of stone and in
        the books of Moses, for it had never been given to them in that way; but
        as the work of the law, or the doctrine it teaches, was written in their
        hearts, it was their bounded duty to obey it. From this it is evident
        that in all this discussion respecting the condemnation of both Gentiles
        and Jews, the Apostle understands by the law, not the ceremonial law, as
        some imagine, but the moral law; for it is the work of it only which the
        Gentiles have by nature written in their hearts. Besides, it is clear
        that he speaks here of that same law of which he says the Jews were
        transgressors when they stole, committed adultery, and were guilty of
        sacrilege.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
        circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: Ver. 29. — But he is a Jew,
        which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
        spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle now passes to what is reality, not supposition, and gives
        here the proof of what he had affirmed, namely, that circumcision
        effects nothing for transgressors of the law, except to cause their
        deeper condemnation, and that the want of circumcision would be no loss
        to those who should have fulfilled the law. The reason of this is, that
        when the Jew shall appear before the tribunal of God, to be there
        judged, and when he shall produce his title as a Jew, as possessing it
        by birth, and his circumcision, as having received it as a sign of the
        covenant of God, God will not be satisfied with such appearances, but
        will demand of him what is essential and real. Now the essence and
        reality of things do not consist in names or in eternal signs; and when
        nothing more is produced, God will not consider a man who possesses them
        as a true Jew, nor his circumcision as true circumcision. He is only a
        Jew in shadow and appearance, and his is only a figurative circumcision
        void of its truth. But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; that is to say,
        that in judging, God will only acknowledge as a true Jew, and a true
        confessor of His name, him who has the reality, — namely, him who is
        indeed holy and righteous, and who shall have fulfilled the law; for it
        is in this fulfillment that confession, and praise, and giving of thanks
        consist, which are the things signified by the name Jew. It is thus we
        are to understand the contrast which Paul makes between ‘outwardly’ and
        ‘inwardly.’ What is outward is the name, what is inward is the thing
        itself represented by the name. And circumcision is that of the heart,
        in the spirit, and not in the letter. — It is essential to keep in view
        that here, and in all that precedes, from the beginning of the 18th
        verse of the first chapter, Paul is referring not to the Gospel, but
        exclusively to the law, and clearing the ground for the establishment of
        his conclusion in the following chapter, verses 19th and 20th,
        concerning the universal guilt of mankind, and the consequent
        impossibility of their being justified by the law. The whole is intended
        to prepare the way for the demonstration of the grand truth announced,
        ch. 1:17, and resumed, ch. 3:21, of the revelation of a righteousness
        adequate to the demands of the law, and provided for all who believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a misapprehension in this respect, very erroneous explanations have
        been given by many of this verse and the context, as well as of the 7th,
        8th, 9th, and 10th of the second chapter, representing these passages as
        referring to the Gospel, and not exclusively to the law. This introduces
        confusion into the whole train of the Apostle’s reasoning, and their
        explanations are entirely at variance with his meaning and object. And
        circumcision . — This passage is often considered as parallel to that in
        the Epistle to the Colossians, ch. 2:11. ‘In whom also ye are
        circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the
        body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ.’ But the
        purpose of the Apostle in the one place and the other is altogether
        different. Many passages, in different connections, which are similar in
        their expressions, are not so at all in their meanings. For the
        illustration of this, it is necessary to remember that the Apostle, as
        has just been observed, is here referring solely to the law, and
        likewise that circumcision in one view respected the legal covenant, of
        which it was a ceremonial obligation, and in another, the evangelical
        covenant, of which it was a type.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the character of a ceremonial obligation of the legal covenant, it
        represented the entire and perfect fulfilling of the law, which
        consisted not merely in external holiness, but in perfect purity of
        soul; and in this sense it represented what no man possessed, but which
        every man must have in order to be justified by the law. In the
        character of a type, it represented regeneration and evangelical
        holiness, which consists in repentance and amendment of life by the
        Spirit of Christ, and in that sense shadowed forth what really takes
        place in those who believe in Jesus Christ. In Colossians, 2:11, the
        Apostle views it in this last aspect; for he means to say that what the
        Jew had in type and figure under the law, the believer has in reality
        and truth under the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the passage before us Paul views it in its first aspect; for he
        is treating of the judgment of strict justice by the law, which admits
        of no repentance or amendment of life. The meaning, then, here is, that
        if the Jew will satisfy himself with bringing before the judgment of the
        law what is only external and merely a ceremonial observance, without
        his possessing that perfect righteousness which this observance denotes,
        and which the Judge will demand, it will serve for no purpose but his
        condemnation. That of the heart in the spirit. — That is to say, what
        penetrates to the bottom of the soul; in one word, that which is real
        and effective. The term spirit does not here mean the Holy Spirit, nor
        has it a mystical or evangelical signification; but it signifies what is
        internal, solid, and real, in opposition to that which was ceremonial
        and figurative. And not in the letter. — Not that which takes place only
        in the flesh, according to the literal commandment, and in all the
        prescribed forms. In one word, it is to the spiritual circumcision that
        the Apostle refers, which is real in the heart and spirit. Whose praise
        is not of men, but of God. — Here Paul alludes to the name of Jew, which
        signifies praise, which may be taken either in an active sense, as
        signifying praising, or in a passive sense, as praised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moses has taken it in this second meaning; when relating the blessing of
        Jacob, he says, ‘Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise.’ The
        Apostle here takes it in the same way; but he does not mean that this
        praise is of men, but of God. The meaning is, that in order to be a true
        Jew, it is not sufficient to possess external advantages, which attract
        human praise, but it is necessary to be in a condition to obtain the
        praise of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The object of the whole of this chapter is to show that the Jews are
        sinners, violators of the law as well as the Gentiles, and consequently
        that they cannot be justified before God by their works; but that, on
        the contrary, however superior their advantages are to those of the
        Gentiles, they can only expect from His strict justice, condemnation.
        The Jews esteemed it the highest honor to belong to their nation, and
        they gloried over all other nations. An uncircumcised person was by them
        regarded with abhorrence. They did not look to character, but to
        circumcision or uncircumcision. Nothing, then, could be more cogent, or
        more calculated to arrest the attention of the Jews, than this argument
        respecting the name in which they gloried, and circumcision, their
        distinguishing national rite, with which Paul here follows up what he
        had said concerning the demands of the law, and of their outward
        transgressions of its precepts. He had dwelt, in the preceding part of
        this chapter, on their more glaring and atrocious outward violations of
        the law, as theft, adultery, and sacrilege, by which they openly
        dishonored God. Now he enters into the recesses of the heart, of which,
        even if their outward conduct had been blameless, and the subject of the
        praise of men, its want of inward conformity to that law, which was
        manifest in the sight of God, could not obtain his praise.
