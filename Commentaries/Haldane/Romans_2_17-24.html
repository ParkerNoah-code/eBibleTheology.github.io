      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 17. — Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
        makest thy boast of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here commences the second part of this chapter, where Paul purposes to
        show that all the external advantages of the Jews over the Gentiles were
        unavailing for their protection from the just condemnation of God. In
        the first place, he enumerates all their privileges, on account of which
        the Jews could exalt themselves above the Gentiles. Afterwards he lays
        it to their charge that, notwithstanding all these privileges, they were
        sinners, equally guilty as others. Finally, he shows that, being
        sinners, as they all were, their advantages would avail them nothing,
        and would only aggravate their condemnation. Behold, thou art called a
        Jew. — The Apostle here continues his discourse to the same persons
        whom, from the commencement of the chapter, he had addressed, and now
        calls on the Jew by name. In this verse, and the three following, Paul
        classes the advantages of the Jews under six particulars: 1. Their
        bearing the name of Jew. 2. Having received the Law. 3. Having the true
        God as their God. 4. Knowing His will. 5. Discerning what is evil. 6.
        Their ability to teach and guide other men.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to the first of these, the name Jew embraces three significations: —
        confession, praise, and thanksgiving; and by these three things that
        people was distinguished from all other nations. The Jew alone had been
        chosen as the confessor of God, while all the rest of the world had
        abjured His service. The Jew alone was appointed to celebrate His
        praises, while by others He was blasphemed. The Jew alone was appointed
        to render thanksgiving to God for multiplied benefits received, while
        others were passed by. In that name, then, in which the Jews gloried,
        and which distinguished them from all other nations, and implied all the
        privileges they enjoyed, they possessed already a signal advantage over
        the Gentiles Dr. Macknight and Mr. Stuart prefer surnamed to called; but
        the name was not exactly what is called a surname. It was the name of a
        whole people. The word called, or denominated, is more appropriate, for
        it answers both to their name as a people and to their religion, both of
        which are comprised in the name Jew. And restest in the law — That is to
        say, thou hast no occasion to study any other wisdom or philosophy than
        the law. It is thy wisdom and thy understanding, Deuteronomy 4:6. The
        term restest signifies two things: the one, that the labor was spared
        the Jews of employing many years and great endeavors, and traveling to
        distant countries, as was the case with other nations, in acquiring some
        knowledge and certain rules of direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law which God had given them rendered this unnecessary, and
        furnished abundantly all that was required for the regulation of their
        conduct. The other idea which this term conveys is, that they had an
        entire confidence in the law as a heavenly and Divine rule which could
        not mislead them, while the Gentiles could have no reliance on their
        deceitful philosophy. And makest thy boast of God — Namely, in having
        Him for their God, and being His people, while the Gentiles, having only
        false gods, were ‘without God in the world,’ Ephesians 2:12. The Jews
        had the true God, the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord who
        had performed glorious miracles in their favor, who had even spoken to
        them from the midst of fire, for the Author of their calling, for their
        Deliverer, for their Legislator, for the Founder of their government,
        and for their King and Protector. His earthly palace was in the midst of
        them; He had regulated their worship, and caused them to hear His voice.
        The other nations possessed nothing similar. They had therefore great
        reason to glory in Him, and on this account David said that in God was
        his strength and his refuge, Psalm 18, 62:7, and <19E401> 144.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — And knowest His wall, and approvest the things that are more
        excellent, being instructed out of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        And knowest His will. — That is, what is agreeable to Him, what He
        requires them to do, what He commands, what He prohibits, what He
        approves, and what He rewards. The term knowest signifies not a confused
        knowledge, such as the Gentiles had by the revelation of nature, but a
        distinct knowledge by the revelation of the word, which the Gentiles did
        not possess. ‘He showeth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His
        judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for
        His judgments, they have not known them,’ <19E719> Psalm 147:19,20. At
        the same time, the Apostle does not mean to say that the Jews had a
        practical knowledge of the will of God, for he immediately accuses them
        of the contrary. And approvest things that are excellent. — This is the
        fifth advantage, which follows from the preceding. They knew the will of
        God, and, knowing that will, they consequently knew what was contrary to
        it; that is to say, those things which God does not approve, and which
        He condemns. For the declaration of what God approves includes, in the
        way of opposition and negation, those things which He does not approve.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this we learn the perfection of the written law, in opposition to
        unwritten traditions; for nothing more is needed in order to know the
        will of God, and to discern what contradicts it. Being instructed out of
        the law. — This refers to the two preceding articles — to the knowledge
        of the will of God, and to the discernment of the things that are
        contrary to it. From their infancy the Jews were instructed in the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
        a light of them which are in darkness: This is the sixth advantage,
        depending on those preceding. The law not only instructed the Jews for
        themselves, but also for others, and in this they held that they enjoyed
        a great superiority over the other nations. A guide to the blind. — The
        Gentiles are here called blind, for with all the lights of their
        philosophy, of their laws and their arts, they were after all blind,
        since, with the exception of those of true religion, which they did not
        possess, there is no true saving light in the world. A light of them
        which are in darkness. — The Rabbis called themselves the light of the
        world, to which our Lord appears to refer when He gives this title to
        His Apostles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
        the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes. — These titles explain
        clearly what the others indicate in metaphorical terms, and further
        exalt the privileges of the Jews. Here we may remark that, although to
        the Gentiles God had given abundance of temporal good things, all this
        was still as nothing in comparison of the blessings vouchsafed to the
        Jews. Which hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law. —
        This does not signify semblance in contradistinction to substance, for
        it was the thing of which the Jews boasted. It means the representation
        or exhibition of truth and summary of knowledge which was contained in
        the law. The meaning is the same as when we speak of a body of divinity.
        The Jews considered that they had a body of truth and knowledge in the
        law. In these expressions, then, truth and knowledge are represented as
        embodied in a visible form. The Jews had that form in the law, that is
        to say, the law was to them a form and model, whence they were to take
        all the true notions of God, of His religion, and of the duty of man,
        and a rule to which they ought to be referred. In general, from all
        these advantages which God had so liberally bestowed on the Jews, we may
        collect that His goodness had been great in not entirely abandoning the
        human race, but in having still lighted up for it, in a corner of the
        earth, the lamp of His law, to serve as His witness. His wisdom has not
        been less conspicuous in having thus prepared the way for the mission of
        His Son, and the establishment of His Gospel throughout the whole world.
        For the law was a schoolmaster until the coming of Christ. We also learn
        that when God does not accompany His external favors with the internal
        grace of His Holy Spirit, the depravity of man is such, that, instead of
        turning to God, he multiplies his transgressions, as the Apostle
        immediately proceeds to show by the example of the Jews. We see, too,
        how aggravated was their ingratitude in the midst of such distinguished
        benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — Thou, therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not
        thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
      </p>
      <p>
        This and the two following verses are in the Vulgate without
        interrogation, but the ancient interpreters read them with the
        interrogation. The meaning, in either case, remains the same. After
        having exalted the advantages of the Jews above the Gentiles with as
        much force as they could have done themselves, Paul unveils their
        hypocrisy, and exhibits the vices which were concealed under so fair an
        exterior He afterwards confirms the whole of his charges by the
        testimony of Scripture. In this manner he establishes more fully what he
        had said in the beginning of the chapter, that they condemned
        themselves, and that they could not hope to escape the just judgment of
        God, but were accumulating a treasure of wrath. Teachest thou not
        thyself. — This implies that the Jews did not practice the precepts of
        their law. It implies that they were practically ignorant of it.
        Preachest, or proclaimest. — There is no reason to suppose, with Dr.
        Macknight, that the learned Jews are here the persons addressed. The
        whole of the Jews are addressed as one person. What is said applies to
        them as a body, and does not exclusively relate to the scribes and
        teachers. Should not steal. — The sins here specified were evidently
        such as were practiced among the Jews. They are not merely supposed
        cases, or specifications for illustration. It is taken for granted that,
        as a body, the sins mentioned were very generally chargeable on them.
        Would the Apostle, addressing the Jews as one man, have asked why they
        were guilty of such a sin, if they were not very generally guilty of it?
        Mr. Tholuck, then, has no ground to suppose the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 22. — Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery? thou that
        abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
      </p>
      <p>
        Oppression of the poor, and adultery, are the crimes with which the Jews
        were chiefly charged by our Lord. Abhorrest idols. — The Jews now
        generally abhorred the idolatry to which in the former ages of their
        history they were so prone, even in its grossest forms. The word in the
        original signifies to abominate, alluding to things most disagreeable to
        the senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is according to God’s account of the sin of idolatry. According to
        human standards of morality, idolatry appears a very innocent thing, or
        at least not very sinful; but in Scripture it is classed among the works
        of the flesh, Galatians 5:20, and is called ‘abominable,’ 1 Peter 4:3.
        It robs God of His glory, transferring it to the creature. Commit
        sacrilege. — The word here used literally applies to the robbery of
        temples, for which the Jews and many opportunities, as well as of
        appropriating to themselves what was devoted to religion, as is
        complained of, Nehemiah 13:10; and of robbing God in tithes and
        offerings, Malachi 3:8; also of violating and profaning things sacred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 23. — Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
        law, dishonorest thou God ?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jews gloried in the law as their great national distinction, yet
        they were egregiously guilty of breaking it, which was highly
        inconsistent and dishonorable to God, not merely ‘as God was the author
        of the law,’ which is the explanation of Mr. Stuart, but because they
        professed to be God’s people and to glory in His law. In any other
        light, the breach of the law by the Gentiles, when they knew it to be
        God’s law, would have been equally dishonorable to God. But God is
        dishonored by the transgressions of His people, in a manner in which He
        is not dishonored by the same transgressions in the wicked, who make no
        profession of being His. It is a great aggravation of the sins of God’s
        people, if they are the occasion of bringing reproach on His religion.
        The world is ready to throw the blame on that religion which He has
        given them; and it is for this that the Apostle, in the following verse,
        reproaches the Jews in regard to the heathen. Sinners also are thus
        emboldened to sin with the hope of impunity, and opposers make it a
        handle to impede the progress of Divine truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears that in the above three verses the Apostle alludes to what is
        said, Psalm 50:16-21. ‘But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to
        do to declare My statutes, or that thou shouldst take My covenant in thy
        mouth? Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest My words behind thee.
        When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been
        partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue
        frameth deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou
        slanderest thine own mother’s son. These things hast thou done, and I
        kept hence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as
        thyself: but I was reprove thee, and set them in order before thine
        eyes.’ On this it may be remarked, that the 50th Psalm predicts the
        change which God was to make in His covenant at the coming of the
        Messiah, and likewise His rejection of His ancient people. As to the
        change of the covenant, it was declared that the sacrifices of the law
        were not acceptable to Him, and that henceforth He will not require from
        men any other than those of praises, thanksgivings, and prayers, which
        are the only acceptable worship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Respecting the rejection of His ancient people, God reproaches them with
        their crimes, and more especially with hypocrisy, which are precisely
        the charges made against them in this place by the Apostle. The
        conclusion from the whole is, that the pretended justification of the
        Jews by the external advantages of the law was a vain pretense; and
        that, as they had so vilely abused the law of which they boasted,
        according to the prediction of the Psalmist, it must follow that the
        accusation now brought against them was established.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle, in these verses, exhibits the most lively image of
        hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was there ever a more beautiful veil than that under which the Jew
        presents himself? He is a man of confession, of praise, of thanksgiving;
        a man whose trust is in the law, whose boast is of God, who knows His
        will, who approves of things that are excellent; a man who calls himself
        a conductor of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness, an
        instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of babes; a man who directs
        others, who preaches against theft, against adultery, against idolatry;
        and, to sum up the whole, a man who glories in the commandments of the
        Lord. Who would not say that this is an angel arrayed in human form — a
        star detached from the firmament and brought nearer to enlighten the
        earth? But observe what is concealed under this mask. It is a man who is
        himself untaught; it is a thief, an adulterer, a sacrilegious person, —
        in one word, a wicked man, who continually dishonors God by the
        transgression of His law. Is it possible to imagine a contrast more
        monstrous than between these fair appearances and this awful reality?
      </p>
      <p>
        Doubtless Paul might have presented a greater assemblage of particular
        vices prevalent among the Jews, for there were few to which that nation
        was not addicted. But he deems it sufficient to generalize them all
        under these charges, — that they did not teach themselves that they
        dishonored God by their transgressions of the law; and of these vices he
        has only particularized three, namely, theft, adultery, and sacrilege:
        and this for two reasons, — first, because it was of these three that
        God had showed the greatest abhorrence in His law; and, secondly,
        because these three sins, in spite of all their professions to the
        contrary, were usual and common among the Jews. There was no people on
        earth more avaricious and self-interested than they. It is only
        necessary to read the narrations of their prophets and historians, to be
        convinced how much they were addicted to robbery, to usury, and to
        injustice. They were no less obnoxious to the charge of fornication and
        adultery, as appears from the many charges preferred against them in the
        writings of the Prophets. They converted the offerings to the purposes
        of their avarice, they profaned the holy places by vile and criminal
        actions; and as the Lord Himself, after Jeremiah, upbraided them they
        turned God’s house of prayer into a den of thieves.
      </p>
      <p>
        These three capital vices, which the Apostle stigmatizes in the Jews,
        like those which he had preferred against the Gentiles, stand opposed,
        on the one hand, to the three principal virtue which he elsewhere
        enumerates as comprehending the whole system of sanctity, namely, to
        live soberly, righteously, and godly; and, on the other hand, they are
        conformable to the three odious vices which he had noted among the
        Gentiles, namely, ungodliness, intemperance, unrighteousness. For theft
        includes, in general, every notion of unrighteousness; adultery includes
        that of intemperance; and the guilt of sacrilege, that of ungodliness.
        Hence it is easy to conclude that, whatever advantages the Jews
        possessed above the Gentiles, they were, notwithstanding, in the same
        condition before the tribunal of God, — like them unrighteous, like them
        intemperate, like them ungodly, and, consequently, like them subjected
        to the same condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 24. — For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
        you, as it is written.
      </p>
      <p>
        The charge alleged here against the Jews, is not that they themselves
        blasphemed the name of God as some understand it, but that they gave
        occasion to the heathen to blaspheme. The Apostle is not charging the
        Jews with speaking evil of God, or with one particular sin, but with the
        breach of their law in general. He here confirms what he had just said
        to this purpose in the foregoing verse, by the authority of Scripture.
        Many suppose that he refers to a passage of Isaiah 52:5, where the
        Prophet says, ‘And my name continually every day is blasphemed.’ But
        there the Prophet does not charge the Jews as having, by their bad
        conduct, occasioned the injury which the name of God received. He
        ascribes it, on the contrary, to the Assyrians, by whom they had been
        subjected. In the passage before us, the reference is to Ezekiel
        36:17-20, where it is evident that the Jews, by the greatness and the
        number of their sins, had given occasion to the Gentiles to insult and
        blaspheme the holy name of God, which is precisely the meaning of the
        Apostle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gentiles, as the Prophet there relates, seized on two pretexts to
        insult the name of God, — the one drawn from the afflictions which the
        sins of His people had brought upon them, and the other from the
        contemplation of the sins themselves. According to the first, they
        accused the God of Israel of weakness and want of power, since He had
        not saved His people from so miserable a dispersion. According to the
        second, they imputed to the religion and the God of the Israelites all
        the crimes which they saw that people commit, as if it had been by the
        influence of God Himself that they were committed. It is on account of
        these two arrogant and malignant accusations that God reproaches His
        people for having profaned His name among the nations; and adds (not for
        the sake of His people, who had rendered themselves altogether unworthy,
        but for that of His own name) two promises opposed to those two
        accusations, — the one of deliverance, the other of sanctification: —
        ’For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all
        countries, and will bring you unto your own land. Then will I sprinkle
        clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean,’ Ezekiel 36:24,25. I will
        deliver you, in order to repel their insult on Me, in accusing Me of
        want of power. I will cleanse you, in order to vindicate Myself from the
        accusation of being the author of your crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        God had no need of either of these ways of justifying Himself. He had
        shown, on numerous occasions, the irresistible power of His arm in favor
        of the Israelites; and the sanctity of His law was self-evident. Yet He
        promises to do these things for His own glory, inasmuch as the Gentiles
        and His people had dishonored His name.
      </p>
      <p>
        No accusation against the Jews could be more forcible than that which,
        in the verse before us, was preferred from the testimony of their own
        Scriptures. It proved that not only were they chargeable before God with
        their own sins, but that they were likewise chargeable with the sins
        which the Gentiles committed in blaspheming His name. This showed
        clearly that they were no more prepared to sustain the judgment of the
        strict justice of God than were the Gentiles, whom they were as ready to
        condemn as the Apostle himself was.
