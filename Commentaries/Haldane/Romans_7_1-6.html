      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        IN the preceding chapter the Apostle had answered the chief objection
        against the doctrine of justification by faith without works. He had
        proved that, by union with Christ in His death and resurrection,
        believers who are thereby justified are also sanctified; he had
        exhibited and enforced the motives to holiness furnished by the
        consideration of that union; he had, moreover, affirmed that sin shall
        not have dominion over them, for this specific reason, that they are not
        under the law, but under grace. To the import of this declaration he now
        reverts, both to explain its meaning, and to state the ground of
        deliverance from the law. This, again, rendered it proper to vindicate
        the holiness of the law, as well as to demonstrate its use in convincing
        of sin; while at the same time he proves that all its light and all its
        authority, so far from being sufficient to subdue sin, on the contrary,
        only tend, by the strictness of its precepts and the awful nature of its
        sanctions, the more to excite and bring into action the corruptions of
        the human heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul next proceeds plainly to show what might be inferred from the
        preceding chapter. Although he had there described believers as dead to
        the guilt of sin, he had, notwithstanding, by his earnest exhortations
        to watchfulness and holiness, clearly intimated that they were still
        exposed to its seductions. He now exhibits this fact, by relating his
        own experience since he became dead to the law and was united to Christ
        By thus describing his inward conflict with sin, and showing how far
        short he came of the demands of the law, he proves the necessity of
        being dead to the law as a covenant, since, in the highest attainments
        of grace during this mortal life, the old nature, which he calls flesh,
        still remains in believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time he represents himself as delighting in the law of God,
        as hating sin, and looking forward with confidence to future deliverance
        from its power. In this manner he illustrates not only the believer’s
        real character, but the important fact that the obedience of the most
        eminent Christian, which is always imperfect, cannot have the smallest
        influence in procuring his justification. He had proved that men cannot
        be justified by their works in their natural state. He now shows, by a
        reference to himself, that as little can they be justified by their
        works in their regenerated state.
      </p>
      <p>
        And thus he confirms his assertion in the 3rd chapter, that by the deeds
        of the law there shall no flesh be justified. He might have described
        more generally the incessant combat between the old and new natures in
        the believer; but he does this more practically, as well as more
        efficiently, by laying open the secrets of his own heart, and exhibiting
        it in his own person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 1. — Know ye not, Brethren (for I speak to them that know law), how
        that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
      </p>
      <p>
        Brethren. — Some have erroneously supposed that, by employing the term
        brethren, the Apostle was now addressing himself exclusively to the Jews
        who belonged to the church at Rome. He is here, as in other parts of the
        Epistle, addressing the whole Church, — all its members, whether Jews or
        Gentiles, being equally concerned in the doctrine he was inculcating. It
        is evident, besides, that he continues in the following chapters to
        address the same persons to whom he had been writing from the
        commencement of the Epistle. They are the same of whom he had affirmed
        in the preceding chapter, verse 14, that they were not under the law,
        which is the proposition he here illustrates. Brethren is an appellation
        whereby Paul designates all Christians, Gentiles as well as Jews, and by
        which, in the tenth chapter, he distinguishes them from the unbelieving
        Jews. Know ye not. — There is much force in this interrogation, and it
        is one usual with Paul when he is affirming what is in itself
        sufficiently clear, as in ch. 6:16; 1 Corinthians 3:16, 6:19. He here
        appeals to the personal knowledge of those to whom he wrote. For I speak
        to them that know law. — This parenthesis appears to imply that, as they
        were acquainted with the nature of law, they must in the sequel be
        convinced of the truth of the explanations he was about to bring under
        their notice; and in this manner he bespeaks their particular attention.
        The law hath dominion over a man. — Man here is not man as distinguished
        from woman, but man including both men and women, denoting the species.
        This first assertion is not confined to the law of marriage, by which
        the Apostle afterwards illustrates his subject, but extends to the whole
        law, namely, the law of God in all its parts. As long as he liveth. —
        The words in the original, as far as respects the phraseology, are
        capable of being rendered, either as long as he liveth, or as long as it
        liveth. It appears, however, that the meaning is, as long as the man
        liveth; for to say that the law hath dominion as long as it liveth,
        would be saying it is in force as long as it is in force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 2. — For the woman which hath an husband is bound by law to her
        husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed
        from the law of her husband.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 3. — So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to
        another man she shall be called an adulteress, but if her husband be
        dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though
        she be married to another man.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle here proves his assertion by a particular reference to the
        law of marriage. And no doubt this law of marriage was purposely adapted
        by God to illustrate and shadow forth the subject to which it is here
        applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had it not been so, it might have been unlawful to become a second time
        a wife or a husband. But the Author of human nature and of the law by
        which man is to be governed, has ordained the lawfulness of second
        marriages, for the purpose of shadowing forth the truth referred to, as
        marriage itself was from the first a shadow of the relation between
        Christ and His Church. Some apply the term law in this place to the
        Roman law, with which those addressed must have been acquainted; but it
        is well known that it was usual both for husbands and wives among the
        Romans to be married to other husbands and wives during the life of
        their former consorts, without being considered guilty of adultery. The
        reference is to the general law of marriage, as instituted at the
        beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 4. — Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by
        the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to Him
        who is raised, from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the illustration it was the husband that died, and the wife remained
        alive to be married to another. Here it is the wife who dies; but this
        does not make the smallest difference in the argument; for whether it is
        the husband or wife that dies, the union is equally dissolved. Dead to
        the law. — By the term the law, in this place, is intended that law
        which is obligatory both on Jews and Gentiles. It is the law, the work
        of which is written in the hearts of all men; and that law which was
        given to the Jews in which they rested, ch. 2:17. It is the law, taken
        in the largest extent of the word, including the whole will of God in
        any way manifested to all mankind, whether Jew or Gentile. All those
        whom the Apostle was addressing had been under this law in their
        unconverted state. Under the ceremonial law, those among them who were
        Gentiles had never been placed. It was therefore to the moral law only
        that they had been married.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who were Jews had been under the law in every form in which it was
        delivered to them, of the whole of which the moral law was the grand
        basis and sum. To the moral law exclusively, here and throughout the
        rest of the chapter, the Apostle refers. The ordinances of the
        ceremonial law, now that their purpose was accomplished, he elsewhere
        characterizes as ‘weak and beggarly elements,’ but in the law of which
        he here speaks he declares, in verse 22 of this chapter, that he
        delights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Stuart understands the term ‘dead to the law’ as importing to
        renounce it ‘as an adequate means of sanctification.’ But renouncing it
        in this sense is no freedom from the law. A man does not become free
        from the law of his creditor when he becomes sensible of his in
        solvency. The most perfect conviction of our inability to keep the law,
        and of its want of power to do us effectual service, would not have the
        smallest tendency to dissolve our marriage with the law. Mr. Stuart
        entirely misapprehends this matter. Dead to the law means freedom from
        the power of the law, as having endured its curse and satisfied its
        demands. It has ceased to have a claim on the obedience of believers in
        order to life, although it still remains their rule of duty. All men are
        by nature placed under the law, as the covenant of works made with the
        first man, who, as the Apostle had been teaching in the fifth chapter,
        was the federal or covenant-head of all his posterity; and it is only
        when they are united to Christ that they are freed from this covenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is simply a law implies no more than a direction and obligation
        authoritatively enforcing obedience. A covenant implies promises made on
        certain conditions, with threatenings added, if such conditions be not
        fulfilled. The language, accordingly, of the law, as the covenant of
        works, is, ‘Do and live;’ or, ‘If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
        commandments;’ and ‘Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
        things that are written in the book of the law to do them.’ It thus
        requires perfect obedience as the condition of life, and pronounces a
        curse on the smallest failure. This law is here represented as being
        man’s original or first husband. But it is now a broken law, and
        therefore all men are by nature under its curse. Its curse must be
        executed on every one of the human race, either personally on all who
        remain under it, or in Christ, who was made under the law, and who,
        according also to the fifth chapter of this Epistle, is the
        covenant-head or representative of all believers who are united to Him
        and born of God. For them He has borne its curse, under which He died,
        and fulfilled all its demands, and they are consequently dead to it,
        that is, no longer under it as a covenant. By the body of Christ. — That
        is, by ‘the offering of the body of Jesus Christ,’ Hebrews 10:10.
        Although the body is only mentioned in this place, as it is said on His
        coming into the world, ‘A body hast Thou prepared Me,’ yet His whole
        human nature, composed of soul and body, is intended. Elsewhere His
        soul, without mentioning His body, is spoken of as being offered. ‘When
        Thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin,’ Isaiah 53:10. Dead to the
        law by the body of Christ, means dead to it by dying in Christ’s death.
        As believers are one body with Christ, so when His body died, they also
        died, Romans 6:3,4. They are therefore, by the sacrifice of His body, or
        by His death, dead to the law. They are freed from it, and done with it,
        as it respects either their justification or condemnation, its curse or
        its reward. They cannot be justified by it, having failed to render to
        it perfect obedience, Romans 3:20; and they cannot be condemned by it,
        being redeemed from its curse by Him who was made a curse for them. As,
        then, the covenant relation of a wife to her husband is dissolved by
        death, so believers are released from their covenant relation to the law
        by the death of Christ, with whom they died; for He died to sin, ch.
        6:10, and to the law having fulfilled it by His obedience and death, so
        that it hath no further demand upon Him. Married to another, even to him
        who is raised from the dead. — Being dead to the law, their first
        husband, by their union with Christ in His death, believers are married
        to Him, and are one with Him in His resurrection. Christ is now their
        lawful husband, according to the clear illustration employed by the
        Apostle respecting the institution of marriage, so that, though now
        married to Him, no fault can be found in respect to their original
        connection with their first husband, which has been dissolved by death.
        To believers this is a most consoling truth. They are as completely and
        as blamelessly free from the covenant of the law as if they had never
        been under it. Thus the Apostle fully explains here what he had briefly
        announced in the 14th verse of the preceding chapter, ‘Ye are not under
        the law, but under grace.’ From the covenant of Adam or of works,
        believers have been transferred to the covenant of Christ or of grace. I
        will ‘give thee for a covenant of the people’ — all the redeemed people
        of, God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the coming of Christ, those who relied on the promise concerning
        Him, likewise partook of all the blessings of the marriage union with
        Him, and were therefore admitted to heavenly glory, though, as to their
        title to it, not ‘made perfect’ ( Hebrews 12:23) till He died under the
        law, and put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. Till that period
        there was in the Jewish ceremonial law a perpetual recognition of sin,
        and of a future expiation, which had not been made while that economy
        subsisted. It was, so to speak, the bond of acknowledgment for the debt
        yet unpaid — the handwriting of ordinances which Jesus Christ, in paying
        the debt, canceled and tore asunder, ‘nailing it to His cross,’
        Colossians 2:14, as a trophy of the victory He had accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ, then, is the husband of the Church; and, under this figure, His
        marriage relation to His people is very frequently referred to in
        Scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus it was exhibited in the marriage of our first parents. In the same
        way it is represented in the Book of Psalm, and the Song of Solomon, and
        in the New Testament, where Christ is so often spoken of under the
        character of ‘the Bridegroom,’ and where the Church is called ‘the
        bride, the Lamb’s wife.’ What ignorance, then, does it argue in some to
        deny the inspiration and authenticity of the Song of Solomon, because of
        the use of this figure! f36 But though believers, in virtue of their
        marriage with Christ, are no longer under the law in respect to its
        power to award life or death, they are, as the Apostle says, 1
        Corinthians 9:21, ‘not without law to God, but under law to Christ.’
        They receive it from His hand as the rule of their duty, and are taught
        by His grace to love and delight in it; and, being delivered from its
        curse, they are engaged, by the strongest additional motives, to yield
        to it obedience. He hath made it the inviolable law of His kingdom. When
        Luther discovered the distinction between the law as a covenant and as a
        rule, it gave such relief to his mind, that he considered himself as at
        the gate of paradise. That we should bring forth fruit unto God. — One
        of the great ends of marriage was to people the world, and the end of
        the marriage of believers to Christ is, that they may bring forth fruit
        to God, John 15:4-8. From this it is evident that no work is recognized
        as fruit unto God before union with Christ. All works that appear to be
        good previous to this union with Christ are ‘dead works,’ proceeding
        from self-love, self-gratification, pride, self-righteousness, or other
        such motives. ‘They that are in the flesh cannot please God.’ ‘The
        carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of
        God, neither indeed can be.’ We can never look upon the law with a
        friendly eye till we see it disarmed of the sting of death; and never
        can bear fruit unto God, nor delight in the law as a rule, till we are
        freed from it as a covenant, and are thus dead unto sin. How important,
        then, is the injunction, ‘Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
        indeed unto sin,’ — and this applies equally to the law, — ’but alive
        unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord,’ Romans 6:11. ‘It is
        impossible,’ says Luther, ‘for a man to be a Christian without having
        Christ; and if he has Christ, he has at the same time all that is in
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        What gives peace to the conscience is, that by faith our sins are no
        more ours, but Christ’s, upon whom God has laid them all; and that, on
        the other hand, all Christ’s righteousness is ours, to whom God hath
        given it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ lays His hand upon us, and we are healed. He casts his mantle
        upon us, and we are clothed; for He is the glorious Savior, blessed for
        ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many wish to do good works before their sins are forgiven them, whilst
        it is indispensable that our sins be pardoned before good works can be
        done; for good works must be done with a joyful heart, and a good
        conscience toward God, that is, with remission of sins.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 5. — For when we were in the flesh, the motives of sins, which were
        by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we were in the Flesh, that is, in our natural state. — The flesh
        here means the corrupt state of nature, not ‘the subjects of God’s
        temporal kingdom,’ as paraphrased by Dr. Macknight, to which many of
        those whom the Apostle was addressing never belonged, flesh is often
        opposed to spirit, which indicates that new and holy nature communicated
        by the Spirit of God in the new birth. ‘That which is born of the flesh
        is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit,’ John 3:6. In
        these words our Lord points out the necessity of regeneration, in order
        to our becoming subjects of His spiritual kingdom. The nature of man
        since the fall, when left to itself, possesses no renovating principle
        of holiness, but is essentially corrupt and entirely depraved. On this
        account, the word flesh here signifies man in his ruined condition, or
        that state of total corruption in which all the children of Adam are
        born. On the other hand, the word spirit has acquired the meaning of a
        holy and Divine principle, or a new nature, because it comes not from
        man but from God, who communicates it by the living and permanent
        influence of His Holy Spirit. Hence the Apostle Peter, in addressing
        believers, speaks of them as ‘partakers of the Divine nature.’ The
        motions of sins, or affections or feelings of sins. When the Apostle and
        the believers at Rome were in the flesh, the desires or affections
        forbidden by the law forcibly operated in all the faculties of their
        depraved nature, subjecting them to death by its sentence. Dr. Macknight
        and Mr. Stuart translate this our ‘sinful passions.’ But this has the
        appearance of asserting that the evil passions of our nature have their
        origin in the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apostle does not mean what, in English, is understood by the
        passions, but the working of the passions. Which were by the law,
        rather, through the law. — Dr. Macknight translates the original thus,
        ‘which we had under the law.’ But the meaning is, not which we had under
        the law, but that were through the law. The motions of sin, or those
        sinful thoughts or desires, on our knowing that the things desired are
        forbidden, are called into action through the law. That it is thus
        natural to the corrupt mind to desire what is forbidden, is a fact
        attested by experience, and is here the clear testimony of Scripture.
        With the philosophy of the question we have nothing to do. Why or how
        this should be, is a question we are not called to resolve. Thus the law
        as a covenant of works not only cannot produce fruits of righteousness
        in those who are under it, but excites in them the motions of sin,
        bringing forth fruit unto death. Did work in our members. — The sinful
        desires of the mind actuate the members of the body to gratify them, in
        a manner adapted to different occasions and constitutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members appear to be mentioned here rather than body, to denote that
        sin, by the impulse of their various evil desires, employs as its slaves
        all the different members of the body. To bring forth fruit unto death.
        — In the same way as bringing forth fruit unto God is spoken of in the
        4th verse, so here the Apostle speaks of bringing forth fruit unto
        death, that is, doing works which issue in death. Death is not viewed as
        the parent of the works. It is the desires that are the parents of the
        works. This is contrasted with fruit unto God, which does not mean that
        God is the parent of the fruit, but that the fruit is produced on God’s
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 6. — But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein
        were held; that we should serve in newness of sprit, and not in the
        holiness of the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now we are delivered from the law. — This does not import merely
        that the Jews were, according to Dr. Macknight, delivered from the law
        of Moses, but that believers are delivered from the moral law, in that
        sense in which they were bound by it when in unbelief. Christ hath
        fulfilled the law, and suffered its penalty for them, and they in
        consequence are free from its demands for the purpose of obtaining life,
        or that, on account of the breach of it, they should suffer death. Mr.
        Stuart paraphrases thus: ‘No longer placing our reliance on it as a
        means of subduing and sanctifying our sinful natures.’ But ceasing to
        rely on the law for such a purpose was not, in any sense, to be
        delivered from the law. The law never proposed such a thing, and
        therefore ceasing to look for such an effect is not a deliverance from
        the law. That beings dead wherein we were held. — By death, whether it
        be considered of the law to believers, or of believers to the law, the
        connection in which they stood to it, and in which they were held in
        bondage under its curse, is dissolved. All men, Jews and Gentiles, are
        by nature bound to the moral law, under its condemning power and curse,
        from which nothing but Christ can to all eternity deliver them. Dr.

        Macknight translates the passage, ‘having died in that by which we were
        tied,’ and paraphrases thus: ‘But now we Jews are loosed from the law of
        Moses, having died with Christ by its curse, in that fleshly nature by
        which, as descendants of Abraham, we were tied to the law.’ But this
        most erroneously confines the declaration of the Apostle to the Jews and
        the legal dispensation. That we should serve in newness of spirit, and
        not in the oldness of the letter. — This is the effect of being
        delivered from the law. The Apostle here refers to the difference in
        practice between those who were married to Christ, and those who were
        still under the law. A believer serves God from such principles,
        dispositions, and views, as the Spirit of God implants in hearts which
        He renews. Serving in the spirit is a service of filial obedience to Him
        who gave Himself for us, as constrained by His love, and in the
        enjoyment of all the privileges of the grace of the new covenant.
        Believers have thus, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, become
        capable of serving God with that new and Divine nature of which they
        partake, according to the spiritual meaning of the law, as His children,
        with cordial affection and gratitude. It is the service not of the
        hireling but of the son, not of the slave but of the friend, not with
        the view of being saved by the keeping of the law, but of rendering
        grateful obedience to their almighty Deliverer.

        Serving in the oldness of the letter, respects such service as the law,
        by its light, authority, and terror, can procure from one who is under
        it, and seeking life by it, without the Spirit of God, and His
        sanctifying grace and influence. Much outward conformity to the law may
        in this way be attained from the pride of self-righteousness, without
        any principle better than that of a selfish, slavish, mercenary, carnal
        disposition, influenced only by fear of punishment and hope of reward.
        Serving, then, in the oldness of the letter, is serving in a cold,
        constrained, and wholly external manner. Such service is essentially
        defective, proceeding from a carnal, unrenewed heart, destitute of
        holiness. In this way Paul describes himself, Philippians 3, as having
        formerly served, when he had confidence in the ‘flesh,’ as he there
        designates such outward service. Serving in newness of spirit and in
        oldness of the letter, are here contrasted as not only different, but as
        incompatible the one with the other.
