      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 14, — How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not
        believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
        and how shall they hear without a preacher?
      </p>
      <p>
        This and the following verse are not the objections of a Jew, as alleged
        by Dr. Macknight. It is all the language of the Apostle in his own
        character.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had said in the preceding verse, that whosoever shall call upon the
        name of the Lord shall be saved. From this he urges the necessity of
        preaching the Gospel to all men; for when it is said that whosoever
        calls on Him shall be saved, it is implied that none shall be saved who
        do not call upon Him. What, then, is the consequence to be drawn from
        this? Is it not that the Gospel should with all speed be published over
        the whole world? If the Gentiles are to be partakers of Divine mercy, it
        is by seeking it from Jesus Christ, who has died that mercy might be
        extended to Jew and Gentile. Is it not by the Holy Ghost speaking to the
        heart of the Gentiles without the instrumentality of the word, that they
        are to be converted and saved. They must hear the word and call on the
        Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whoever is saved by Jesus Christ must call upon Him. How then shall they
        call on Him in whom they have not believed? — If, in order to salvation,
        it be necessary to call on Christ, how can the Gentiles call on Him when
        they do not believe in Him? And how shall they believe in Him of whom
        they have not heard? — This is impossible. In this state were the
        Gentile nations before the Gospel reached them. Hence the great
        importance of communicating to them the glad tidings of salvation. And
        how shall they hear without a preacher? — The Gospel was not to be
        immediately declared by the voice of God from heaven, or by the Holy
        Ghost speaking without a medium of communication, or by angels sent from
        heaven; it was to be carried over the world by men. How, then, according
        to this Divine constitution, could the nations of the earth hear the
        Gospel without a preacher? It is unnecessary to refute the opinion of
        those who hold that the Gospel cannot speak to men savingly in the
        Scriptures, and that it is never effectual without the living voice of a
        preacher. This is not the meaning of the Apostle. His doctrine is, that
        the Gospel must be communicated to the minds of men through the external
        instrumentality of the word, as well as by the internal agency of the
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Men are not only saved through Christ, but they are saved through the
        knowledge of Christ, communicated through the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is
        written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of
        peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Gentiles could not believe in the Lord without hearing of Him,
        and if they could not hear of Him unless He was declared to them, then
        it follows, from the prophecy above quoted, that preachers must be sent
        to them. Notwithstanding, then, the violent opposition made to it by the
        Jews, the necessity was manifest for the Apostles, according to their
        Divine commission, to go forth to preach the Gospel to every creature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The accordance of this with the Old Testament Scriptures, Paul had been
        showing, and he now supports it by further quotation. As it is written,
        etc. — This prophecy, Isaiah 52:7, which may literally respect good news
        of deliverance to the Jews from temporal judgments, typically refers, as
        the Apostle’s application of it here shows, to the messengers of mercy
        sent forth under the Gospel. In the beginning of that chapter, Zion or
        Jerusalem, the Church of God, is called to arise from her degraded
        condition, for the Lord has prepared for her deliverance. Then follow
        the words here quoted. The tidings to be told are next subjoined. ‘Thy
        God reigneth.’ That the Gentiles also should partake in the blessings of
        His reign, is immediately intimated. ‘The Lord hath made bare His holy
        arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall
        see the salvation of our God.’ Thus, beginning at Jerusalem, those
        commissioned by the Lord were to preach salvation in His name among all
        nations. In the conclusion of the chapter, the blessed effects under the
        reign of the Messiah are declared. ‘So shall He sprinkle many nations;
        the kings shall shut their mouths at Him; for that which had not been
        told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they
        consider.’ This quotation, then, made by the Apostle, was calculated to
        produce the strongest conviction of the truth he was establishing,
        namely, the duty of preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 16. — But they have not all obeyed the Gospel: for Esaias saith,
        Lord, who hath believed our report?
      </p>
      <p>
        It is here admitted by Paul, that though the Gospel was to be preached
        both to Jews and Gentiles, with the assurance that whosoever believeth
        shall be saved, yet, as a matter of fact, all who heard did not believe
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might seem unaccountable; or it might even appear to be an argument
        against the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, that,
        notwithstanding all the blessings with which it was said to be fraught
        to those who should receive it, it was still rejected by many to whom it
        was preached. But this should not seem strange to any acquainted with
        prophecy: it is the very testimony of Isaiah. Instead, then, of being an
        objection to the preaching of the Gospel, that it was not received by
        the bulk of those who heard it, it was the very thing which the
        Scriptures predicted. The prophecy of Isaiah 53:1, is here applied to
        this fact, in which a plain intimation is given of the small number who
        should receive the Gospel when first preached. If, then, the Jews
        objected to the preaching of the Gospel from this fact, they must object
        to the Prophet Isaiah on the same ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 17. — So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
        God.
      </p>
      <p>
        According, then, to this complaint of the Prophet, it is evident that
        faith comes by hearing, which the Apostle is asserting; and this is the
        consequence to be deduced from it. The word in the preceding verse,
        quoted from Isaiah, and rendered ‘report,’ is the same which in this
        verse is rendered hearing. Faith, then, never comes but by hearing, that
        is, by the word of God. The Apostles communicated their testimony by the
        living voice, and by their writings. Both are comprehended in what is
        called hearing. All this showed the necessity of preaching the Gospel to
        the Gentiles, on which Paul had been insisting, according to which there
        is no such thing as saving faith among heathens who have not heard of
        Christ. Hearing by the word of God. — This makes the last observation
        still stronger. The hearing cannot extend to Dr. Macknight’s scheme of
        salvation to the heathens, who supposes that they may have faith without
        the knowledge of the Gospel; for, consistently with this passage, faith
        must come, not from the revelation of the works of God, but from that of
        His word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 18. — But I say, Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound went
        into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gospel had now been everywhere preached, Colossians 1:23. The
        Apostle applies to this fact what is said in the nineteenth Psalm. That
        Psalm literally refers to the preaching of the great luminaries of
        heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; but typically it refers to the
        preaching of the word of God. The sun of the creation preaches to all
        nations the existence, the unity, the power, the wisdom, and the
        goodness of God. He speaks in a language all nations may understand. All
        nations, indeed, have departed from the doctrine thus preached; but this
        results from disaffection to the doctrine, and not from the obscurity of
        the language of the preacher. The Apostle tells us that all nations,
        even the most barbarous, are without excuse in their idolatry. God is
        revealed in His character as Creator in the works of His hands, and all
        men should know Him as such. The sun carries the intelligence of God’s
        perfections and existence to every nation under heaven, which are
        successively informed that there is an almighty, all-wise, and
        beneficent Being, the author of all things. In like manner, the Gospel
        of Christ preaches to all nations, and informs them of the glorious
        character of God, as manifested in the incarnation and death of His Son
        Jesus Christ, while it reveals His mercy concerning which the works of
        creation are silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight supposes the question here asked, ‘Have they not heard?’
        to be answered by the preaching of the works of creation, according to
        the words of the Psalm in their literal meaning. This is contrary to the
        whole train of the Apostle’s reasoning, who is speaking of the preaching
        of the Gospel. Even Calvin makes the preaching spoken of in that Psalm
        to refer to the ‘silent works of God’ in ancient times, and not in any
        sense to the preaching of the Apostles. But it is evident that the
        Apostle is not referring to the former, but to the present state of the
        Gentile nations. The words of the Psalmist are thus spiritually, as they
        always have been literally, fulfilled in the preaching of the silent
        works of God. The description in the nineteenth Psalm, of the sun in the
        firmament, has, as above noticed, a strict literal and primary meaning,
        but it is also typical of Him who is called the Sun of Righteousness,
        who by His word is the spiritual light of the world. Paul therefore
        quotes this description in the last sense, thus taking the spiritual
        meaning, which was ultimately intended. This suits his object, while he
        drops the literal, although also a just and acknowledged sense. It is
        not, then, as setting aside the literal application of such passages
        that the Apostles quote them in their spiritual import, nor in the way
        of accommodation, as is so often asserted, to the great disparagement
        both of the Apostles and the Scriptures, but as their ultimate and most
        extensive signification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 19. — But I say, Did not Israel know? First, Moses saith, I will
        provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish
        nation I will anger you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did not Israel know, that they were to be rejected as a nation, and the
        Gentiles called into the Divine favor? That this was communicated in
        their Scriptures is most clear. In the quotation here adduced,
        Deuteronomy 31:21, this event was foretold by Moses, who commences that
        prediction in a way that marks the importance of what he was about to
        say: ‘Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
        words of my mouth.’ In verse 5th, he declares the ingratitude and
        unbelief of Israel. ‘They have corrupted themselves; their spot is not
        the spot of His children; they are a perverse and crooked generation.’
        He continues this complaint to the 20th verse, when he pronounces the
        decree of God of their rejection. ‘I will hide My face from them, I will
        see what their end shall be; for they are a very forward generation,
        children in whom is no faith.’ And then immediately he adds the words
        from which the verse before us is taken. In these words the calling of
        the Gentiles is clearly predicted. The Gentiles are marked by these
        expressions: — 1st , ‘I will move them to jealousy with those which are
        not a people, I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.’ 2nd ,
        Their calling is pointed out by the provocation to jealousy with which
        God threatens the Jews, which intimates that He will bestow His love and
        His covenant on those who were formerly foolish, and will withdraw them
        from Israel. 3rd , This same calling is marked by the comparison drawn
        between that provocation to jealousy with which He threatens Israel,
        with that with which the Israelites have provoked Him. ‘They have moved
        Me to jealousy;’ that is, as they had given their love and their heart
        to others besides God, in the same way God would give His love and His
        heart to others besides them. This prediction, then, could only find its
        accomplishment in the conversion of the Gentiles by the Gospel of Jesus
        Christ. The word ‘nation’ is here a figurative expression in reference
        to God’s dealings with Israel. The Gentiles are called as individuals.
        The ‘righteous nation,’ Isaiah 26:2, is composed of believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
        sought Me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 21. — But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth
        My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Moses predicted, somewhat obscurely, the calling of the Gentiles,
        Isaiah had foretold it very plainly, and placed it in a light most
        offensive to the Jews. In this prophecy, the bringing in of the
        Gentiles, and their ready reception of the Gospel, and at the same time
        the obstinate unbelief of the Jews, notwithstanding the earnest and
        constant invitations of God by His servants, are plainly indicated.
        Nothing could more clearly describe the conduct of the Jews, and the
        reception they gave to the message of salvation, than this prophecy of
        Isaiah. In this and the preceding chapter, the Apostle has fully shown
        that the calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the great body of
        the Jewish nation, had been the purpose of God during the whole of that
        economy which separated the Jews from the rest of the world, and under
        which they had enjoyed such distinguished and peculiar privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in the ninth chapter the sovereignty of God in the rejection of
        the great body of the Jewish nation is Prominently brought into view, in
        the chapter before us their rejection is shown to have been the
        immediate effect of their own unbelief. No truth is more manifest in
        every part of the Old Testament Scriptures, than that contained in the
        declaration just referred to, Isaiah 65:2. All day long I have stretched
        forth My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. — What outward
        means did not God employ to induce the Israelites to love and honor Him,
        and to lead them to submission to His authority! ‘I have hewed them by
        the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth,’ Hosea 6:5. ‘I
        earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up
        out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and
        protesting, saying, Obey My voice,’ Jeremiah 11:7. ‘And now, O
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt
        Me and My vineyard. What could have been done more to My vineyard that I
        have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth
        grapes, brought it forth wild grace?’ Isaiah 5:3. Here, then, is the
        stretching forth of the hands of God to that people all the day long,
        that is, during the whole period of their dispensation; and here the
        complaint is verified of their continuing, notwithstanding, disobedient
        and gainsaying. The fault, then, was their own, and the awful sentence
        that followed, Isaiah 5:5,6, was merited and juSt. In this we see what
        is the result, when God employs only outward means to lead men to
        obedience, and does not accompany them with the influence of His
        efficacious grace. Without this, the Apostle shows in the preceding
        chapter, that the whole nation of Israel, without exception, would have
        been as Sodom and Gomorrah. Here, then, is the condition to which many
        in their wisdom would reduce all mankind, if they could establish their
        unscriptural doctrines in opposition to Divine election and efficacious
        grace. They are displeased at the idea that all the heathen nations were
        left to themselves, while so much favor was shown to Israel; yet we see
        in the case of Israel, in whom so full a display is made of the
        character of man, what would have been the result as to the other
        nations of a similar dispensation of outward means. But, according to
        the system of such cavilers at the clear doctrine of the Scriptures,
        there still remains something good in man, which may lead him, without a
        change of heart, to embrace the glad tidings of salvation. Many of them
        also affirm that man has power to resist and make void the internal
        operation of grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        In support of this last opinion, reference is made to such texts as that
        in Genesis 6:3, where God says, ‘My Spirit shall not always strive with
        man;’ and to the words of Stephen, when he charges the Jews as
        stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, who, like their
        fathers, always resisted the Holy Ghost, Acts 7:51. But the answer is
        easy when we attend to the different aspects in with the grace of God is
        presented in Scripture. Besides its existence in the mind of God, it is
        spoken of either in its manifestation in His word, or in its operation
        in the heart. In its manifestation it may, and, unless accompanied by
        its internal operation, always will, be resisted. To such resistance the
        above passages refer, and give their attestation; and for the truth of
        this we also can appeal not only to the example of the nation of Israel,
        but also to what we see passing before us every day. Multitudes, in the
        enjoyment of the full light of the revelation of grace, continually
        discover their resistance to its manifestation in the word. But not so
        with respect to grace, in its internal operation in the heart. This
        cannot be effectually resisted. On the contrary, so far as it proceeds,
        it takes away all inclination to resist, creating a new heart, and
        making those who are its subjects willing in the day of God’s power,
        <19B003> Psalm 110:3. Here, then, there must be an election by God of
        those who shall thus be favored, without which not one individual would
        be saved. If the doctrine of the fall in its proper extent be admitted,
        the doctrines of election and efficacious grace must be embraced by
        those who do not believe that all men are to be left to perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this chapter we see how highly God values His law. Though the Jews
        had a zeal of God, yet they were rejected, because they attempted to
        substitute their own obedience, which fell short of the demands of the
        law, which requires perfection. In order that any of the human race
        might be saved, it was necessary that the Son of God should fulfill the
        law. He alone is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
        believeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this law of everlasting obligation, under which all mankind were
        placed, it may be proper to make a few general remarks, as well as on
        the covenant with Israel, to which there is also reference in this
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is the Legislator as well as the Creator of the world, and His law
        is necessarily founded on the relation in which He stands to His
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The law is a transcript of His character, proclaiming His holiness, His
        justice, and His goodness; in one word, His love, for God is love. The
        sum of it is, ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
        thy neighbor as thyself.’ Thus love is the fulfilling of the law; the
        end of the commandment is love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The love demanded from the creature is primarily for God His Creator,
        the great object of love. The second part of the summary of the law, far
        from opposing, coincides with and flows from the first, commanding us to
        love our neighbor as the creature of God. The love it thus requires of
        us for man is measured by that which we bear to ourselves, and
        consequently teaches that self-love is not to be condemned, unless it be
        excessive or exclusive. It is proper and necessary as a part of the law
        of our creation, which imposes on us the duty of attending to and
        providing for our own wants.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law must necessarily be the law of the whole intelligent creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to its holiness, justice, and goodness, nothing more and
        nothing less can be required of any creature. ‘The law of the Lord is
        perfect.’ In nothing is it deficient; in nothing does it exceed. It
        requires perfect obedience, which is essential to the nature of every
        law; for no law can dispense with the smallest part of the obedience it
        demands. Any work of supererogation, then, is impossible. No creature in
        the universe can do more than love God with all his heart and strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law is enforced by sanctions. These are indispensable in order to
        carry it into execution, and maintain the dignity of the Lawgiver. Both
        the reward of obedience and the punishment of transgression proceed from
        the character of God. God loves Himself and His creatures. He is love
        for Himself above all, being the supreme object of love, and infinitely
        worthy of being loved. He is also love for His creatures, as appears by
        the original situation in which all of them were placed. The angels at
        their creation were the inhabitants of heaven, where God manifests His
        glory. When man was created, the world was provided for him, and adapted
        to his nature; he enjoyed communion with God, and everything around him
        was pronounced to be ‘very good.’
      </p>
      <p>
        From their happy original situation, a part of the angels and all
        mankind have fallen by disobedience. They broke the perfect bond of
        love, and consequently the unhappiness which proceeds from their
        rebellion against God can only be attributed to themselves. God, who is
        infinite in every perfection, and of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,
        must necessarily punish sin; for sin is the violation of the law of
        love. It separates the creature from God, who is the source of
        happiness; it is rebellion against His just government; and its tendency
        is to produce universal confusion and misery. The love, therefore, of
        God for Himself and for all that is good; His holiness, which places Him
        in infinite opposition to sin; His regard for the honor of His law; and
        His justice, which requires the giving to all what is due, — demand that
        sin should be punished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evil of violating the law of God may be estimated by the punishment
        inflicted on the human race on account of one transgression. That one
        transgression caused the entrance of death, spiritual, temporal, and
        eternal; but by the goodness of God men were immediately placed under a
        dispensation of mercy. Human governments, being imperfect, dispense with
        justice when they extend pardon to a criminal; but this cannot be so
        with God, who, when He shows mercy, acts consistently with justice. He
        remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself. He proclaims Himself to be ‘a
        just God, and a Savior.’ In the plan, then, of mercy and salvation, the
        law is maintained in all its authority, and with all its sanctions. Sin
        is punished, while sinners are saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authority, the majesty, and the sovereignty of God are evidently
        interested in carrying into effect His threatenings and denunciations of
        punishment. If human laws were not executed, it would introduce
        confusion and disorder into families and states; but if the law of God
        were left unexecuted, there would be absolute confusion and disorder
        throughout the universe. The object, therefore, of the law, is an object
        of unspeakable importance, infinitely above that of the laws of men. Its
        immediate end is the manifestation of the holiness and glory of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the law of universal and eternal obligation, the observance of
        other laws was enjoined on the people of Israel, in subserviency to the
        advent of the Messiah, to prefigure that great event, and in order to
        keep them separate from the other nations till He should appear. The
        covenant with Israel consisted of three parts: the first was the moral
        law; the second, the ceremonial; and the third, the judicial or
        political law. The moral law was such as has been already described. The
        ceremonial law consisted of a body of worship and of services, which the
        Israelites were commanded to render to God; and to this belonged all the
        various ordinances, purifications, sacrifices, oblations, celebrations
        of solemn feasts, and observances of days, excepting the seventh day,
        Sabbath, as being a part of the moral law. The judicial law comprehended
        all the regulations enjoined for their social and political conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with these laws, there was vouchsafed a manifestation of the mercy
        of God through the Messiah. This comprehended all the promises of grace
        and salvation, and of the remission of sins, which God gave to the
        Israelites, proclaiming Himself to them as the Lord God, merciful and
        gracious, together with all the exhortations to repent, and have
        recourse to His fatherly goodness. It likewise included all those
        prophecies which foretold the Messiah, and required men to believe and
        place in Him their confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this manifestation of grace and of mercy did not properly
        belong to the legal, but to the evangelical covenant, yet, as it was
        connected under the same ministry with the moral, the ceremonial, and
        the judicial laws, the Scripture includes the whole under the term law;
        the denomination of the ministry being taken from the part that
        predominated. The reason why this revelation of the Gospel was joined
        with the law is obvious. God purposed to save many among the Israelites,
        and to conduct them, as His elect and true children, to life and
        salvation. But this could not be effected by the legal covenant alone;
        for the law made nothing perfect; it was weak through the flesh, and
        could not justify. It was necessary, then, to connect with it a measure
        of the dispensation of the Spirit; and without this, the state of the
        Israelites would have been worse than that of the other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The economy of Moses was not, however, to be permanent. The object of
        the ceremonial law was accomplished, when that came which is called, in
        the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:1, ‘perfection,’ which was the grand
        consummation of all the typical ordinances, by the sacrifice of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that period its use was superseded, and itself abolished. On the
        destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, where alone the sacrifices
        could be offered, and on the expulsion of the Jews from their own land,
        the observance both of the ceremonial and judicial laws became
        impracticable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole Mosaic economy, which had been glorious in itself, was done
        away, and ceased to have any glory by reason of the glory that
        excelleth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral law, however, could never be superseded. Although it formed a
        part of the Mosaic economy, to that economy it did not exclusively
        belong. Under the moral law, as a covenant, man at the beginning had
        been placed and under it, as broken, and pronouncing its curse, all
        unbelievers remain as one with the first man. But from this covenant,
        they who are united to Him by whom it has been fulfilled, are for ever
        freed. According to the energetic language of the Apostle, in the
        seventh chapter of this Epistle, they are ‘dead to the law.’ While dead
        to it, however, as a covenant, whether as to its blessing or its curse —
        justification by it or condemnation — it remains their rule of duty, and
        must for ever continue in force. And that its authority should continue,
        while the other parts of that first covenant were done away, as it had
        existed before that covenant was made, was clearly indicated at its
        first promulgation from Mount Sinai. On that occasion it was strikingly
        distinguished from the other parts of the law. These were delivered to
        Moses, and by him to the people. But the moral law was promulgated by
        the voice of God, and it is said, ‘He added no more.’ While the other
        laws were written in a book by Moses, this law of everlasting obligation
        was written on tables of stone by the finger of God, and it alone was
        deposited in the ark. ‘There was nothing in the ark save the two tables
        of stone,’ 1 Kings 8:9. There, as inscribed on these tables, the law was
        placed under the mercy-seat, which was an eminent type of Him by whom it
        was to be fulfilled. To minister and prepare the way for His appearance
        was the great object in view in the calling of Abraham, in the setting
        apart his descendants as a people from among whom He was to spring, in
        the public proclamation of this law which had been transgressed, and in
        thus depositing it in the ark, and it alone, not even to be looked upon
        till He should come by whom it was fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the third chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, a
        contrast is drawn between the ministration of Moses and that of the
        Apostles, in order to demonstrate the superiority of the latter. The
        ministration committed to Moses is there denominated the ‘letter,’ and
        that committed to the Apostles, the ‘spirit’ — the one written and
        engraved in stones, the other in the fleshly tables of the heart. On the
        ministration of the letter or outward form, in which spiritual blessings
        were veiled under sensible images and carnal ordinances, a degree of
        obscurity remained, called the veil on Moses’ face, so that Israel after
        the flesh could not steadfastly look to the end, or final object, of
        that which was to be abolished. They rested in the observance of the
        ordinances, without considering their grand object, and looked to their
        temporal deliverances, without attending to the spiritual redemption
        which they prefigured. In the same way, what was external to the senses
        in the priesthood and the sacrifices, was all that they regarded. Their
        services were therefore those of the letter, with no discernment of the
        spirit, apart from which these services were a body without a soul. The
        nation of Israel, in general, thus verified the declaration that the
        things of the Spirit of God are foolishness to the natural man; neither
        can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. Not aware of
        the extent of the law which is spiritual, and of the perfect conformity
        required to all its precepts, and relying on the sacrifices they offered
        for the pardon of their transgressions, they sought acceptance by their
        own righteousness. But neither by their obedience could they fulfill the
        demands of the law, nor could the sacrifices remove their guilt, while
        by them they could not obtain peace of conscience, or assure themselves
        of reconciliation with God. The covenant, then, of which Moses was the
        mediator, gendered to bondage. It was the ministration of ‘condemnation’
        and ‘death,’ for ‘the letter killeth.’ The spirit only, which that
        letter veiled, ‘giveth life,’ 2 Corinthians 3:6. Paul denominates the
        ministration committed to him the ministration of righteousness — the
        righteousness of the Messiah; and his lamentation in the chapter before
        us is, that Israel being ignorant of this righteousness, went about to
        establish their own righteousness, not submitting themselves unto the
        righteousness of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction, however, between the letter and the spirit did not
        refer exclusively to the nation of Israel. It related formerly, and has
        done so at every period, to all who, professing to worship God, are
        still in the flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moral law, as has been observed, had been in force from the
        beginning, as is proved in this Epistle, ch. 5:13; although more fully
        promulgated in the covenant with Israel. But as soon as Adam had
        committed the sin by which it was broken, and all men had thus been
        brought under its condemnation, in pronouncing sentence on him, a
        proclamation of mercy was made, and sacrifices were instituted, which
        indicated the spirit equally with those afterwards enjoined on Israel in
        the ceremonial law. Among the nations, therefore, the true worshippers
        of God — such as Abel, who offered his sacrifice in faith, Enoch, who
        prophesied of the coming of the Lord, Noah, who found grace in the eyes
        of the Lord, Melchizedek, of whom it is particularly recorded, Hebrews
        7:2, that he was first the king of righteousness, and then, or after
        that, also king of peace, and Abraham, who saw the day of Christ, with
        many more — worshipped God in the spirit. The service of all others who
        were ignorant of the true intent and end of the sacrifices, and of that
        righteousness which the Messiah was to bring in, which Noah had
        preached, 2 Peter 2:5, was the service of the letter that ‘killeth.’
        From this the necessity of preaching the Gospel to the nations, on which
        the Apostle so much insists in this chapter, is manifest. The heathens
        have generally retained the form of sacrifice, but, having entirely lost
        sight of the end of that institution, like Israel after the flesh, they
        know nothing beyond the letter which killeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such also is the service of all professed Christians, of whatever name,
        who go about to establish their own righteousness, which is of the law.
        To all men, of every description, who are laboring under the burden of
        sin, our Lord by His Gospel, wherever it reaches, proclaims, as formerly
        to Israel, Come unto Me and I will give you rest; thus extending to them
        the ministration, not of condemnation, but of righteousness, — not of
        the letter that killeth, but of the spirit that giveth life. He Himself
        is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty, 2
        Corinthians 3:17. ‘It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
        nothing; the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
        life.’ ‘If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free
        indeed.’
