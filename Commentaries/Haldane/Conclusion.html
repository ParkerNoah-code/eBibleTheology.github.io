      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        It is peremptory in its doctrine of obedience to the civil magistrates,
        and enjoins submission to the higher powers on a footing to which the
        world was previously a stranger. Yet this cannot be suspected of being a
        contrivance of magistrates. For while it urges subjection in civil
        matters to those authorities whom God in His providence has appointed,
        it condemns as without excuse that idolatry which the existing rulers,
        at the time when it was written, professed, and for the support of which
        they persecuted Christians to the death. This can no more be a forgery
        of the rulers than of the subjects.

        There is another peculiarity in the latter part of this Epistle, which
        evinces admirable wisdom, but a wisdom far removed from the wisdom of
        man. It contains, in the short compass of a few chapters, an amazing
        variety of precepts, expressed perspicuously, yet briefly, respecting
        conduct in domestic life, in society, and in church fellowship. Had
        uninspired men been discoursing on these various subjects, they would
        have produced a series of distinct treatises, formally handled, and
        largely illustrated. In the writings of the Apostle, a single sentence
        embraces a volume, while this peculiarity differs so widely from any
        procedure of human wisdom, that it proclaims itself to be the wisdom of
        God. It is thus that the Scriptures are contained in a comparatively
        short book, which is addressed to the great body of mankind, and whose
        contents are inexhaustible.

        Yet amidst such careful parsimony of words, amidst such a condensation
        of matter, the Apostle closes the Epistle with what might seem a most
        prodigal waste, by sending so many salutations, and expressing, in such
        a variety of terms, ceremonious attentions to his fellow-Christians at
        Rome.

        Here, however, as in other cases, wisdom is justified of her children;
        for this, also, is one of those characteristics by which God stamps His
        image on all His productions. The Christian will be at no loss to
        discover, on reflection, that this part of the Epistle is not without
        its use; and, in the exposition of the last chapter, it has been a
        peculiar object to point out how we may reap instruction, from what
        human wisdom, in its folly, will scarcely admit to be reckoned as a part
        of that Book, which is nothing less thanTHE WORD OF GOD.

        The doctrines unfolded in this Epistle reveal to us the mighty plan of
        redemption, by which our powerful spiritual enemies are overcome, and
        all the strong and deeply-rooted evils lodged within our bosoms shall
        finally be subdued. The whole leads believers to exclaim, — ’The Lord
        reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad
        thereof. Clouds and darkness are round about Him: righteousness and
        judgment are the habitation of His throne. A fire goeth before Him, and
        burneth up His enemies round about. The heavens declare His
        righteousness, and all the people see His glory. Ye that love the Lord,
        hate evil; He preserveth the souls of His saints; He delivereth them out
        of the hand of the wicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of
        His holiness.’ These emphatic words of the Psalmist, though recorded
        more than a thousand years before the age of the Apostle, most
        graphically delineate the leading features of Paul’s Epistle to the
        Romans, and portray in vivid colors those emotions in the minds of
        believers which the consideration of them is so well fitted to produce.
        And those who have never perused this astonishing portion of the Divine
        word with a holy relish, and have not entered into its meaning, have
        never experienced the fullness of that joy and peace which it is
        calculated to produce in the heart of every true worshipper of the God
        and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ THE END.
