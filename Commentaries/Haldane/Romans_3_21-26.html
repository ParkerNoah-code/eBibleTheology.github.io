      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 27. — Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of
        works?
      </p>
      <p>
        Nay; but by the law of faith. Where is boasting then? — That is,
        according to the doctrine which the Apostle, by the Spirit of God, is
        teaching. There is no ground for it, or for ascribing salvation in any
        part or degree to the works of men. This shows that salvation was
        appointed to come to the redeemed through faith, for the very purpose of
        excluding all pretenses to allege that human merit has any share in it.
        This applies to all works, moral as well as ceremonial. If ceremonial
        works only were here meant, as many contend, and if moral works have
        some influence in procuring salvation, or in justification, then the
        Apostle could not have asked this question. Boasting would not have been
        excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul had declared the only way in which a man can be ‘just with God.’ He
        had proved that it is not by His own righteousness, which is of the law,
        but by that righteousness which is received by faith. This is clear from
        what had been advanced in the preceding verse, from which this is an
        inference. If, then — as if he had said — God had purposed that men
        should have any group of boasting, He would not have set forth Christ to
        be a propitiation through faith in His blood, that thereby a way might
        be opened for justifying sinners, so that His justice might suffer no
        prejudice.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now He has taken this course; and therefore the only way of
        justification precludes all boasting. ‘Paul is not here,’ says Calvin,
        ‘disputing merely concerning ceremonies, or any external works, but
        comprehends all works of every kind and degree. Boasting is excluded
        without all doubt, since we can produce nothing of our own that merits
        the approbation or commendation of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here he is not speaking of limitation or diminution of merit, since
        he does not allow the least particle of it. Thus, if boasting of works
        be removed by faith, so that it takes away from man all praise, while
        all power and glory are ascribed to God, it follows that no works
        whatever contribute to the attainment of righteousness.’ By what law is
        boasting excluded? — It is not by that of works; for if works were
        admitted, in the smallest degree, to advance or aid man’s justification,
        he might in that proportion have ground of boasting. It is, then, by the
        law of faith; not by a law requiring faith, or as if the Gospel was a
        law, a new law, or, as it has been termed, a remedial or mitigated law;
        but the word law is here used in allusion to the law of works, according
        to a figure usual in the Scriptures. By the same figure Jesus says,
        ‘This is the work of God, that ye believe in Him whom He hath sent.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Here faith is called a work, for a similar reason. Faith in the
        righteousness of Christ is, by the appointment of God, the medium of a
        sinner’s justification, without any consideration of works. This way of
        justification clearly shows that a man has no righteousness of his own,
        and that he can obtain nothing by means of conformity to the law, which
        can have no place, since he must admit that he is a transgressor. It
        impels him to flee out of himself, and to lay hold of the righteousness
        of another, and so leaves no room for glorying or boasting in himself,
        or in his own performances more or less. His justification is solely by
        faith; and it is clear that to believe a testimony, and rely on what has
        been done by another, furnish no ground for boasting. ‘Therefore it is
        by faith, that it might be by grace.’ The whole plan of salvation
        proceeds on this principle, ‘that no flesh should glory in His
        presence,’ but ‘that, according as it is written, he that glorieth, let
        him glory in the Lord.’ No ingenuity can ever make elevation by human
        merit consistent with the passage before us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 28. — Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith
        without the deeds of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore we conclude. — In the 20th verse the Apostle had arrived at
        the conclusion, from all he had said before, that by works of law no man
        shall be justified in the sight of God. He had next pointed out the way
        of justification by faith in the atonement; and here He comes to His
        second grand and final conclusion, as the sum of all He had taught in
        the preceding part of the Epistle. Justified by faith. — Faith does not
        justify as an act of righteousness, but as the instrument by which we
        receive Christ and His righteousness. Believers are said to be justified
        by faith and of faith, and through faith, but never on account of faith.
        The declaration of James, that a man is justified by works, and not by
        faith only, is not in any respect opposed to the affirmation in the
        passage before us. The question with him is not how men may obtain
        righteousness for themselves in the presence of God, but how they are
        proved to be righteous; for he is refuting those who make a vain boast
        of having faith, when they have only what he calls a dead faith, — that
        is, faith only in profession, which he illustrates by a man’s having the
        appearance of compassion without the reality, and by referring to the
        body without the spirit or breath. f21 Without the deeds of the law,
        literally without works of law, for here, as in verse 31st, the article
        is wanting. — This does not signify, as Dr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macknight understands it, that ‘perfect obedience’ to law is not
        necessary; it signifies that no degree of obedience to law is necessary.
        Good works are necessary for the believer, and are the things which
        accompany salvation, but they are not in any respect necessary to his
        justification. They have nothing to do with it. This passage asserts not
        merely that men are justified by faith without perfect obedience to any
        law, but without any obedience of their own. It may likewise be
        remarked, that believers will not be acquitted at the last day on
        account of their works, but will be judged according to their works. But
        God does not justify any according to their works, but freely by His
        grace; and not by works, or according to the works of righteousness
        which they have done, Titus 3:5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 29. — Is He the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the
        Gentiles?
      </p>
      <p>Yes, of the Gentiles also.</p>
      <p>
        Rather, Is He the God of Jews only? Is He not also of Gentiles? The
        article before Jews and Gentiles, which is not in the original, makes
        the assertion respect Jews and Gentiles in general. In the sense of the
        passage, God is not the God either of the Jews or of the Gentiles in
        general; but He is the God of Jews and Gentiles indifferently, when they
        believe in His Son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 30. — Seeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by
        faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing it is one God. — This assigns the reason why God must be the God
        of Gentiles as well as of Jews. If He justifies both in the same way, He
        must be equally the God of both. In the previous part of the discussion,
        Paul had shown that by works of law no flesh shall be justified, proving
        it first respecting Gentiles, and afterwards respecting Jews. Now he
        affirms that God’s method of justifying man applies equally to Jews and
        Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        This confirms his doctrine respecting the ruin of all men by sin, and of
        there being only one way of recovery by the righteousness of God
        received through faith. To urge this was likewise of great importance,
        with a view to establish the kingdom of Christ in all the earth, Romans
        10:11,13. Having thus reduced the whole human race to the same level, it
        follows that all distinction among them must be from God, and not from
        themselves, — all standing on the same footing with respect to their
        works. There is but one God, and so but one way of becoming His people,
        which is by faith. By faith, and through faith. — It is difficult to see
        why the prepositions here are varied. Similar variations, however, occur
        in other places, where there appears to be no difference of meaning, as
        in Galatians 2:16, where justification, as applied to the same persons,
        is spoken of in the same sense, ‘knowing that a man is not justified by
        works of law, but through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have
        believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the faith of
        Christ.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 31. — Do we then make void law through faith God forbid: yea, we
        establish law.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the doctrine of justification by faith alone, which the Apostle had
        been declaring, it might be supposed that the law of God was made void.
      </p>
      <p>
        This consequence might be drawn from the conclusion that a man is
        justified by faith without any respect to his obedience to law. This the
        Apostle denies, and, on the contrary, asserts that by his doctrine the
        law is established. The article is here wanting before law, indicating
        that the reference is not to the legal dispensation, or to the books of
        Moses, as in the last clause of verse 21, but to the general law of God,
        whether written or unwritten. Make void law. — ’ Bring it to naught,’ as
        the same word in the original is rendered, 1 Corinthians 1:28; or
        ‘destroy,’ Corinthians 6:13, and 15:26; ‘done away,’ 2 Corinthians
        3:7-14; ‘abolished,’ Ephesians 2:15; 2 Timothy 1:10. Professors Tholuck
        and Stuart, not perceiving how the doctrine of the Apostle establishes
        the authority of the law, understand law in this place as signifying the
        Old Testament. This entirely destroys the meaning and use of the
        passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        That the Old Testament teaches the same way of justification as that
        taught by the Apostles, is indeed a truth, an important truth, but not
        the truth here asserted. Mr. Stuart says, ‘How gratuitous justification
        can be said to confirm or establish the moral law (as this text has been
        often explained), it seems difficult to make out.’ There is not here the
        smallest difficulty. It is quite obvious in what way gratuitous
        justification by Christ establishes Law. Can there be any greater
        respect shown to the law, than that when God determines to save men from
        its curse, He makes His own Son sustain its curse in their stead, and
        fulfill for them all its demands? When a surety pays all that is due by
        a debtor, the debtor receives a gratuitous discharge: but has the debt,
        or the law that enforces the debt, been on that account made void? Here,
        as well as in so many other parts of his exposition of this Epistle, we
        discover the unhappy effect of this commentator’s misunderstanding the
        meaning of the expression at its commencement, the righteousness of God.
        That he should feel the difficulty he states above, is not surprising,
        for, according to the view he gives of justification, the law of God is
        completely made void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Macknight explains establishing law to be making it ‘necessary in
        many respects.’ ‘The Gospel,’ he says, in his view and illustration of
        ch. 1:16, 17, ‘teaches, that because all have sinned, and are incapable
        of perfect obedience, God hath appointed, for their salvation, a
        righteousness without law; that is, a righteousness which does not
        consist in perfect obedience to any law whatever, even the righteousness
        of faith, that being the only righteousness attainable by sinners; and
        at the same time declares that God will accept and reward that kind of
        righteousness through Christ, as if it were a perfect righteousness.’
        Accordingly, in this interpretation of the 21st verse of chapter 3, he
        says: ‘But now, under the Gospel, a righteousness appointed by God, as
        the means of the justification of sinners, without perfect obedience to
        law of any kind, is made known.’ In this manner, mistaking, like
        Professors Tholuck and Stuart, although in a different way, the import
        of the expression, ‘the righteousness of God,’ he misunderstands the
        whole train of the Apostle’s reasoning, from the 17th verse of the first
        chapter to the end of the fifth chapter, as well as its object; in this
        discussion on justification, and by his explanation, altogether makes
        void the law. Instead of making it ‘necessary in many respects,’ Dr.
        Macknight, as well as Dr. Stuart and Mr. Tholuck, by representing it as
        satisfied with an imperfect obedience, which does not meet the demands
        of any law, either human or Divine, makes it void in every respect. Such
        is the entire consistency among themselves of the doctrines of
        Scripture, that whenever any one of them is misunderstood, it invariably
        leads to the misunderstanding of the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many commentators, with more or less clearness, refer to the doctrine of
        sanctification, either in whole or in part, the Apostle’s denial that he
        makes void the law. According to them, it is not made void for this
        reason, because it convinces men of sin, and does not release from
        personal obedience to its precepts. That the doctrine of justification,
        by the imputation of Christs righteousness, does not release believers
        from obedience to the law, is a most important truth, which Paul fully
        establishes in the sixth chapter of this Epistle. On the contrary, it
        lays them under additional obligations to obey it, by furnishing
        additional motives to the love of God. But since their sanctification is
        always in this life imperfect, were there nothing else to meet the
        demands of the law, it would be made void — it would remain unfulfilled,
        both in its precept and penalty. In addition to this, the whole of the
        previous discussion regards the doctrine of justification, while not a
        word is said respecting sanctification. And it is evident that this
        verse is introduced to obviate an objection which might naturally
        present itself, namely, if man’s obedience, in order to his
        justification, be set aside, the law, which requires obedience, is made
        void.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Paul appeals to his doctrine, and, according to his usual manner,
        strongly rejects such an inference. In the preceding verses, from the
        20th, he had been announcing that the righteousness of God, which is the
        complete fulfillment of the law, is placed to the account of him who
        believes for his justification, whereby God, in thus justifying the
        sinner solely on the ground of a perfect obedience, shows Himself to be
        just. Do we then, he says, make void the law? This doctrine not only
        maintains the authority of the law of God, but also exhibits the
        fulfillment of all its demands. The connecting particle shows that Paul
        rests his proof on what had gone before, to which he appeals, and not on
        the ground of sanctification, to which he had been making no reference,
        and which, if he had referred to it, would not have borne out his
        assertion. ‘Think not,’ said our blessed Lord, ‘that I am come to
        destroy the law and the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
        fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot
        or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.’
        It is to this fulfillment — to the righteousness of God, which in the
        context the Apostle had been illustrating, and which Jesus Christ
        brought in — that he here appeals. Do we make law void when we conclude
        that a man is justified by faith without doing the works of law, since
        we show that through his faith he receives a perfect righteousness, by
        which, in all its demands and all its sanction, it is fulfilled? No; it
        is in this very way we establish it. In this glorious establishment of
        the law of God, Paul, in another place, exults, when he counts all
        things but loss for the excellency of Christ, and desires to be found in
        Him, not having his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that
        which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God
        by faith. While he thus tramples on his own righteousness, by which the
        law never could be established, he confidently appeals to the
        righteousness of God, now made his by faith. This is precisely in
        accordance with his conclusion in the 28th verse, that a man is
        justified by faith without the deeds of law; and afterwards, at the
        termination of his mortal career, in the immediate prospect of death, he
        triumphs in the consideration that there is laid up for him a crown of
        righteous — a crown, the reward of that perfect obedience by which the
        law is magnified and made honorable.
