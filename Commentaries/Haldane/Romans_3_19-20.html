      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>

      <p>
        Ver. 19. — Now we know that whatsoever thing the law saith, it saith to
        them who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the
        world may become guilty before God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The article is in this verse prefixed to the term law, while it is
        wanting in the following verse. This shows that here the reference is to
        the legal dispensation, and applies in the first clause specially to the
        Jews; while, in the law clause, the expression ‘all the world,’ and, in
        the following verse, the term ‘law,’ without the article, refers to all
        mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul here anticipates two general answers which might be made to those
        passages which he had just quoted, to convict the Jews, as well as all
        other men, of sin. First, that they are applicable not to the Jews but
        to the Gentiles, and that, therefore, it is improper to employ them
        against the Jews. Second, that even if they referred to the Jews they
        could only be applied to some wicked persons among them, and not to the
        whole nation; so that what he intended to prove could not thence be
        concluded, namely, that no man can be justified before God by the law.
        In opposition to these two objections, he says, that when the law
        speaks, it speaks to those who are under it, — to the Jews therefore;
        and that it does so in order that the mouths of all, without
        distinction, may be stopped. If God should try the Jews according to the
        law, they could not stand before His strict justice, as David said, ‘If
        Thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquity, O Lord, who shall stand?’ <19D003>
        Psalm 130:3. And, in addition to this, whatever there was of piety and
        holiness in some it was not by the efficacy of the law, but by that of
        the Gospel — not by the spirit of bondage, but by the spirit of
        adoption; so that it remains true that all those who are under the law
        are under sin. That, or in order that. — This must be taken in three
        senses. 1st , The law brought against the Jews those accusations and
        reproaches of which Paul had produced a specimen in the passages quoted,
        in order that every mouth may be stopped; this is the end which the law
        proposed. 2nd , This was also the object of God, when He gave the law,
        for He purposed to make manifest the iniquity of man, and the rights of
        justice, Romans 5:20. 3rd , It was likewise the result of the legal
        economy. Every mouth may be stopped. — This expression should be
        carefully remarked. For if a man had fulfilled the law, he would have
        something to allege before the Divine tribunal, to answer to the demands
        of justice; but when convicted as a sinner, he can only be silent — he
        can have nothing to answer to the accusations against him; he must
        remain convicted. This silence, then, is a silence of confession, of
        astonishment, and of conviction. This is what is elsewhere expressed by
        confusion of face. ‘O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto Thee; but unto
        us, confusion of faces,’ Daniel 9:7. And all the world. — That is to
        say, both Jews and Gentiles. The first clause of this verse, though
        specially applicable to the Jews, proves that since they, who enjoyed
        such peculiar privileges, were chargeable with those things of which the
        law accused them, the rest of mankind, whom the Apostle here includes
        under the term ‘all the world,’ must also be under the same
        condemnation. The law of nature, written on their consciences,
        sufficiently convicts the Gentile’s; and as to the Jews who try to
        stifle the conviction of their consciences by abusing the advantages of
        the law, that law itself, while it accuses, convicts then; also. This
        expression, then, must include the whole human race. It applies to all
        men, of every age and every nation. None of all the children of Adam are
        excepted. Words cannot more clearly include, in one general
        condemnation, the whole human race. Who can be excepted? Not the
        Gentiles, since they have all been destitute of the knowledge of the
        true God. Not the Jews, for them the law itself accuses. Not believers,
        for they are only such through their acknowledgment of their sins, since
        grace is the remedy to which they have resorted to be freed from
        condemnation. All the world, then, signifies all men universally. May
        become guilty. — That is, be compelled to acknowledge themselves guilty.
        The term guilty signifies subject to condemnation, and respects the
        Divine judgment. It denotes the state of a man justly charged with a
        crime, and is used both in the sense of legal responsibility and of
        blame worthiness. This manifestly proves that in all this discussion the
        Apostle considers sin in relation to the condemnation which it deserves.
        Before God — When the question respects appearing before men, people
        find many ways of escape, either by concealing their actions, by
        disguising facts, or by disputing what is right. And even when men pass
        in review before themselves, self-love finds excuses, and various shifts
        are resorted to, and false reasonings, which deceive. But nothing of
        this sort can have place before God. For although the Jews flattered
        themselves in the confidence of their own righteousness, and on this
        point all men try to deceive themselves, it will be entirely different
        in the day when they shall appear before the tribunal of God; for then
        there will be no more illusions of conscience, no more excuses, no way
        to escape condemnation. His knowledge is infinite, His hand is
        omnipotent, His justice is incorruptible, and from Him nothing can be
        concealed. Before Him, therefore, every mouth will be stopped, and all
        the world must confess themselves guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 20. — Therefore by the deeds of law there shall no flesh be
        justified in His sight; for by law is the knowledge of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the final conclusion drawn from the whole of the preceding
        discussion, beginning at verse 18th of chapter first. The Apostle had
        shown that both the Gentiles and the Jews are under sin; that is, they
        have brought down upon themselves the just condemnation of God. He had
        proved the same thing in the preceding verse, according to the
        scriptures before quoted. Therefore. — The conclusion, then, from the
        whole, as containing in this verse, is evident. By the deeds of the law,
        or, as in the original, of law. — The reference here is to every law
        that God has given to man, whether expressed in words, or imprinted in
        the heart. It is that law which the Gentiles have transgressed, which
        they have naturally inscribed in their hearts. It is that law which the
        Jews have violated, when they committed theft, adulteries, and
        sacrileges, and which convicted them of impiety, of evil-speaking, of
        calumny, of murder, of injustice. In one word, it is that law which
        shuts the mouth of the whole world, as had been said in the preceding
        verse, and brings in all men guilty before God. The deeds, or works of
        law. — When it is said, by works of law no flesh shall be justified, it
        is not meant that the law, whether natural or written, was not capable
        of justifying. Neither is it meant that the righteousness thus resulting
        from man’s fulfillment of all its demands would not be a true
        righteousness, but that no man being able to plead this fulfillment of
        the law before the tribunal of God — that perfect obedience which it
        requires — no man can receive by the law a sentence pronouncing him to
        be righteous. To say that the works of the law, if performed, are not
        good and acceptable, and would not form a true righteousness, would
        contradict what had been affirmed in the preceding chapter, verse 13,
        that the doers of the law shall be justified. The Apostle, then, does
        not propose here to show either the want of power of the law in itself,
        or of the insufficiency of its works for justification, but solely to
        prove that no man fulfills the law, that both Gentiles and Jews are
        under sin, and that all the world is guilty before God. No flesh — This
        reference appears to be to <19E301> Psalm 143 David there says, ‘no man
        living.’ Paul says, ‘no flesh.’ The one is a term which marks a certain
        dignity, the other denotes meanness. The one imports that whatever
        excellence there might be supposed to be in man, he could not be
        justified before God; and the other, that being only flesh, — that is to
        say, corruption and weakness, — he ought not to pretend to justification
        by himself. Thus, on whatever side man regards himself, he is far from
        being able to stand before the strict judgment of God. Shall be
        justified in His sight. — The meaning of the term justified, as used by
        the Apostle in the whole of this discussion, is evident by the different
        expressions in this verse. It appears by the therefore, with which the
        verse begins, that it is a conclusion which the Apostle draws from the
        whole of the foregoing discussion. Now, all this discussion has been
        intended to show that neither Gentiles nor Jews could elude the
        condemnation of the Divine judgment. The conclusion, then, that no flesh
        shall be justified in the sight of God by the works of law, can only
        signify that no man can be regarded as righteous, or obtain by means of
        his works a favorable sentence from Divine justice. It is in this sense
        that David has taken the term justify in Psalms 143, to which the
        Apostle had reference, Enter not unto judgment with Thy servant; for in
        Thy sight shall no man living be justified. The terms in His sight
        testify the same thing, for they accommodate themselves to the idea of a
        tribunal before which men must appear to be judged. It is the same with
        regard to the other terms, by the deeds of law; for if we understand a
        justification of judgment, the sense is plain: no one can plead before
        the tribunal of God a perfect and complete fulfillment of the law, such
        as strict and exact justice demands; no one, therefore, can in that way
        obtain justification. In justifying men, God does all, and men receiving
        justification, contribute nothing towards it. This is in opposition to
        the justification proposed by the law by means of obedience, in which
        way a man would be justified by his own righteousness, and not by the
        righteousness which God has provided and bestows. For by law is the
        knowledge of sin. — Paul does not here intend simply to say that the law
        makes known in general the nature of sin, inasmuch as it discovers what
        is acceptable or displeasing to God, what He commands, and what He
        forbids; but he means to affirm that the law convicts men of being
        sinners. For his words refer to what he had just before said in the
        preceding verse, that all that the law saith, it saith to them who are
        under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
        become guilty before God, which marks a conviction of sin. But how, it
        may be said, does the law give that knowledge or that conviction of sin?
        It does so in two ways. By the application of its commandments, and its
        prohibitions in the present state in which man is placed, for it excites
        and awakens the conscience, and gives birth to accusing thoughts. This
        is common both to the written law and the law of nature. It does this,
        secondly, by the declaration of punishments and rewards which it sets
        before its transgressors and observers, and as it excites the
        conscience, and gives rise to fear and agitation, thus bringing before
        the eyes of men the dreadful evil of sin. This also is alike common to
        the law of nature and the written law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here it is important to remark that God, having purposed to establish
        but one way of justification for all men, has permitted, in His
        providence, that all should be guilty. For if there had been any
        excepted, there would have been two different methods of justification,
        and consequently two true religions, and two true churches, and
        believers would not have had that oneness of communion which grace
        produces. It was necessary, then, that all should become guilty. The
        Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of
        Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe, Galatians 3:22; Romans
        11 32.
