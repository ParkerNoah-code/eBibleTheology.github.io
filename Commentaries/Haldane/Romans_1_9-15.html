      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        Ver. 9. — For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
        gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in
        my prayers.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is my witness. — This is substantially an oath; and refutes the
        erroneous and mischievous notion of some who maintain, from a
        misapprehension of what is said by our Lord and the Apostle James, that
        all oaths are unlawful. Paul’s affection for those to whom he wrote was
        such, that, in making his appeal to God, he desires to expose it to His
        judgment in respect to its truth and sincerity. Whom I serve with my
        spirit. — All the service of God is of this kind; but it is here
        expressed for the sake of energy, and to distinguish the true servants
        of God, who serve in the Gospel with their heart in the work, from
        hirelings, whose labors are formal and only external. It expresses the
        sincerity and ardor of the service that Paul rendered to God, as if he
        had said, with all his heart and all the faculties of his soul. It also
        imports the nature of the service in which he was employed, namely, a
        spiritual service, in opposition to the service of the priests and
        Levites in the tabernacle, which was in a great measure a bodily
        service. On this account he adds, in the Gospel of His Son; that is to
        say, in the ministry of the Gospel in which he labored for the unfolding
        of the Divine mysteries to make them known. Thus Paul shows, from the
        character of his ministry, that his obedience was not in pretense only,
        but in sincerity. Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
        prayers — Some place these last words, ‘always in my prayers,’ in the
        beginning of the next verse, as in the Vulgate and the French versions;
        but the difference is not material. This is a striking proof of the
        frequency of Paul’s prayers, in which he interceded for those whom he
        was addressing — ’without ceasing’ — ’always.’ In like manner, in
        writing to the Philippians, he says, ‘Always, in every prayer of mine
        for you all, making request with joy.’
      </p>
      <p>
        We thus learn the duty of Christians to pray for one another, and that
        those who believe the Gospel are as much bound to pray for its success,
        and the prosperity of the churches, as to labor in the work. Both prayer
        and labor ought to go together. To pray without laboring is to mock God:
        to labor without prayer is to rob God of His glory. Until these are
        conjoined, the Gospel will not be extensively successful. From many
        other parts of Paul’s writings, we learn how assiduous he was in the
        duty of prayer, which he so earnestly inculcates on all believers. ‘In
        everything giving thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
        concerning you,’ 1 Thessalonians 5:18. ‘Be careful for nothing; but in
        everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your
        requests be made known unto God,’ Philippians 4:6. How precious is the
        promise connected with this admonition! ‘And the peace of God, which
        passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
        Christ Jesus.’
      </p>
      <p>
        But since all events are fixed, even from eternity, in the counsels and
        wisdom of God, of what avail, it may be said, are these prayers? Can
        they change His eternal counsels, and the settled order of events?
        Certainly not.
      </p>
      <p>
        But God commands us to pray, and even the prayers of His people are
        included in His decrees; and what God has resolved to do, He often gives
        to their prayers. Instead, then, of being vain, they are among the means
        through which God executes His decrees. If, indeed, all things happened
        by a blind chance, or a fatal necessity, prayers in that case could be
        of no moral efficacy, and of no use; but since they are regulated by the
        direction of Divine wisdom, prayers have a place in the order of events.
        After many gracious promises, it is added, Ezekiel 36:37, ‘Thus saith
        the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel
        to do it for them.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In this verse Paul shows his zeal for God and his love for believers,
        which ought never to be separated. We should love our brethren because
        we love God. These two things corresponded in Paul to the two favors he
        had received, which he marked in the 5th verse, namely, ‘Grace and
        Apostleship.’ ‘God, as if he said, ‘has given me grace, and on my part I
        serve Him with my spirit; He has given me Apostleship, and I have you
        continually in remembrance.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 10. — Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
        prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making request. — Paul’s affection for those to whom he wrote impelled
        him, not once or twice with a passing wish, but at all times, to desire
        to be present with them, notwithstanding the inconveniences of so long
        and perilous a journey. He asks of God that by some means now at length
        he might be permitted to visit them. Thus Christian love searches out
        new objects on which to exercise itself, and extends itself even to
        those who are personally unknown. I might have a prosperous journey, by
        the will of God. — This teaches us that God, by His providence,
        regulates all that takes place. There is nothing with which Christians
        should be more habitually impressed, than that God is the disposer of
        all events. They should look to His will in the smallest concerns of
        life, as well as in affairs of the greatest moment. Even a prosperous
        journey is from the Lord. In this way they glorify God by acknowledging
        His providence in all things, and have the greatest confidence and
        happiness in walking before Him. Here we also learn that, while the will
        of God concerning any event is not ascertained, we have liberty to
        desire and pray for what we wish, provided our prayers and desires are
        conformed to His holiness. But will our prayers be agreeable to God if
        they be contrary to His decrees? Yes, provided they be offered in
        submission to Him, and not opposed to any known command; for it is the
        revealed, and not the secret will of God that must be the rule of our
        prayers. We also learn in this place, that since all events depend on
        the will of God, we ought to acquiesce in them, however contrary they
        may be to our wishes; and likewise, that in those things in which the
        will of God is not apparent, we should always accompany our prayers and
        our desires with this condition, if it be pleasing to God, and be ready
        to renounce our desires as soon as they appear not to be conformed to
        His will. ‘O how sweet a thing,’ as one has well observed, ‘were it for
        us to learn to make our burdens light, by framing our hearts to the
        burden, and making our Lord’s will a law!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 11. — For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
        spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul greatly desired to see the believers at Rome, to impart to them
        some spiritual gift. The opinion of Augustine, that this means the love
        of one’s neighbor, in which he supposes the church at Rome was
        deficient, has no foundation. It was not a new degree of the Spirit of
        sanctification that he desired to communicate, for this Paul had it not
        in his power to bestow, 1 Corinthians 3:6. He appears to refer to some
        of the extraordinary gifts conferred by the Apostles, by which they
        might be more established in their most holy faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 12. — That is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the
        mutual faith both of you and me.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is . — This does not mean that what follows is intended as an
        explanation of what he had just said, for to those whom Paul addressed
        it must have been sufficiently clear; but is a modification of it
        respecting his purpose, lest he should appear to consider them as not
        well instructed or established in their faith. For although he always
        acted faithfully, no one, as is evident from his writings, was ever more
        cautious to avoid unnecessary offense. He therefore joins himself with
        those to whom he wrote, and refers to the advantage which he also
        expected reciprocally to derive from them. It is no valid objection to
        understanding it to be a miraculous gift which he desired to
        communicate, that he hoped for mutual advantage and comfort with those
        whom he was about to visit. This comfort or confirmation which he looked
        for, was not from a spiritual gift to be bestowed by them, but would be
        the effect of their confirmation, by the gift they received through him.
        The gift, too, bestowed by him, would be a new proof of the power of God
        in him, and of His approbation in enabling him to exert such power. He
        would be comforted and strengthened in witnessing their faith in respect
        to his own labors in his ministry, by seeing the kingdom of God
        advancing more and more, and with respect to his numerous afflictions to
        which he was on all hands subjected, and also in contrasting the
        coldness and weakness of many of which he often complains, when he
        observed the increasing power of Divine grace in the saints at Rome. On
        the other hand, they would derive from Paul’s presence the greatest
        consolation from his instructions in the mysteries of salvation, from
        his exhortations, which must contribute much to their edification, as
        well as from his example, his counsels, and his prayers. It is thus the
        duty of Christians to confirm each other in the faith; and their mutual
        intercourse makes known the faith that each possesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        They see that their experience answers as face answers to face in a
        glass; and by beholding the strength of faith in their brethren,
        Christians are edified and confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 13. — Now, I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes
        I purposed to come unto you (but was let hitherto), that I might have
        some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul’s zeal and affection for those to whom he wrote, were not of recent
        origin; they had long been cherished in his heart. Of this he did not
        wish them to be ignorant. It is of importance that believers should know
        the love entertained for them by the servants of God. It is a testimony
        of the love of God Himself. Paul wished to see some fruit of his
        ministry among them. This was his great desire everywhere in the service
        of Christ. ‘I have chosen you and ordained you,’ said Jesus to His
        Apostles, ‘that ye should go and bring forth fruit;’ and Paul ardently
        longed to see the fulfillment of this gracious promise among those to
        whom he wrote, for believers were his joy and crown. As among other
        Gentiles. — The apostleship of Paul had not been unfruitful, ch. 15:17.
        He had traveled through a great part of Syria, of Asia, and of Greece,
        and everywhere he had either been the means of converting sinners or
        edifying believers. This was a source of much joy to him; but after so
        many labors, he did not wish for repose. He desired to go to Rome to
        obtain fruit there also. He had been let, or hindered, hitherto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our desires are always pleasing to God when their object is to promote
        His glory; but sometimes He does not see good to give them effect. It
        was good that it was in David’s heart, although he was not permitted, to
        build the house of God. The times and the ways of God’s providence are
        often unknown to us, and therefore our desires and designs in His
        service ought always to be cherished in submission to His Divine wisdom.
        Paul had been hindered till now from going to Rome. This may have
        happened in different ways, and through what are called second causes.
        It may have been occasioned by the services he found it indispensable to
        perform in other churches before leaving them; or it may have arisen
        from the machinations of Satan, the God of this world, exciting
        disturbances and opposition in these churches, 1 Thessalonians 2:18; or
        he may have been prevented by the Spirit of God, Acts 16:7. His being
        hindered, by whatever means, from going to Rome, when he intended it,
        shows that the Apostles were sometimes thwarted in their purposes, and
        were not always under the guidance of Divine inspiration in their plans.
        This, however, has nothing to do with the subject of their inspiration
        as it respects the Scriptures, or as it regards their doctrine. Thou who
        raise any objection to the inspiration of the Scriptures, from the
        disappointments or misconduct of the Apostles, confound things that
        entirely and essentially differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 14. — I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to
        the wise and to the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul was their debtor, not by any right that either Greeks or Barbarians
        had acquired over him, but by the destination which God had given to his
        ministry towards them. He does not, however, hesitate to recognize the
        debt or obligation, because, when God called him to their service, he
        was in effect their servant, as he says in another place, ‘Ourselves
        your servants for Jesus’ sake.’ The foundation of this duty was not in
        those whom he desired to serve, but in God, and the force of this
        obligation was so much the stronger as it was Divine; it was a law
        imposed by sovereign authority, and consequently an inviolable law. With
        regard to Paul, it included, on the one hand, all the duties of the
        apostolic office, and, on the other, the dangers and persecutions to
        which that office exposed him, without even excepting martyrdom, when he
        should be called to that last trial. All this is similar to what every
        Christian owes in the service of God, as far as his abilities, of
        whatever kind they are, and his opportunities, extend.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Greeks — under which term all civilized nations were included —
        were the source of the arts and sciences, of knowledge and civilization,
        it might be said that the Apostle should attach himself solely to them,
        and that he owed nothing to the Barbarians. On the contrary, it might be
        alleged that he was debtor only to the Barbarians, as the Greeks were
        already so enlightened. But in whatever way these distinctions were
        viewed, he declares that both the one and the other were equal to him:
        he was debtor to them all, — to the Greeks, because their light was only
        the darkness of error or of idle speculation — to the Barbarians, for he
        ought to have compassion on their ignorance. He was debtor to the wise,
        that is to say, the philosophers, as they were called among the Greeks;
        and to the unwise, or those who made no profession of philosophy. He
        knew that both stood equally in need of the Gospel, and that for them
        all it was equally adapted. This is the case with the learned and the
        unlearned, who are both altogether ignorant of the way of salvation,
        till it be revealed to them by the Gospel, to which everything, by the
        command of God, the wisdom as well as the folly of the world, — in one
        word, all things besides, — must yield subjection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ver. 15. — So, as much as in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
        that are at Rome also.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul was always zealous to do his duty; at the same time, he always
        acknowledged his dependence on God. This is an example which Christians
        ought to imitate on all occasions, never to deviate from the path of
        duty, but to leave events in the hands of God. The contrary of this is
        generally the case. Christians are often more anxious and perplexed
        about their success, than with respect to their duty. They forget what
        regards themselves, and wish to meddle with what does not belong to them
        but to God. To you also. — He does not inquire or decide whether they
        ought to be reckoned among the Barbarians or the Greeks, the wise or
        unwise; he was ready to preach the Gospel to them all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here terminates the preface to the Epistle. The first five verses
        include the general introduction, the last ten embrace the particular
        address to those to whom it is written. The introduction contains the
        name, the character, and the office of the writer; his vindication of
        the Gospel against the cavils of the Jews, proving that it was not a
        novel doctrine, and that the Apostles were not opposed to the Prophets.
        It authenticates the whole of the Jewish canon, and attests its
        inspiration. It undermines the errors of the Jews respecting tradition,
        and directs them to the Scriptures alone. It next announces the Messiah
        as the subject of the Gospel, — His glorious person as God and man, His
        birth and resurrection, His abasement and exaltation, and His almighty
        power. It finally asserts the communication of grace to the Apostle, his
        appointment to the office he sustained, the purpose for which it was
        conferred, along with a commission, of which he states the grounds, to
        all the nations under heaven. Where else shall be found so much matter
        compressed in so little space? where so much brevity connected with so
        much fullness?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the latter part, in which Paul addresses those to whom his Epistle
        was directed, he introduces many things well calculated to rivet their
        attention and engage their affections, while at the same time he conveys
        very grave and salutary instructions. What must have been the feelings
        of the Roman converts, when they saw the intense interest with which
        they were regarded by this great Apostle; when they considered the
        grandeur and value of the Gospel, to which he was about to call their
        attention in his Epistle; and when they were cheered by the hope of
        shortly seeing in the midst of them one whose heart glowed with such
        love to God, and such benevolence to them! All this must have tended to
        produce a reciprocal regard and reverential feeling towards the Apostle,
        an ardent desire to profit by his instructions, together with much
        gratitude to God, and many prayers to hasten his voyage to come among
        them. Paul did arrive at Rome, but, in the providence of God, in a very
        different manner, and in circumstances very different, from what he
        appears to have expected when he prayed for ‘a prosperous journey.’ He
        went there a prisoner in bonds, was shipwrecked on his voyage, and kept
        in confinement after his arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        But although he was bound, the word of God was not bound; and all fell
        out, in the adorable providence of God, for the furtherance of the
        Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The circumstances, however, in which he was placed were not in the
        meantime joyous, but grievous. Yet now that he stands before the throne,
        now that he has received the crown of righteousness, and is numbered
        among the spirits of just men made perfect, what regret can he
        experience that, during the few and evil days he spent on earth, he was
        conducted to Rome through persecutions, imprisonments, storms, and
        shipwreck, an outcast among men, but approved and accepted of God?
