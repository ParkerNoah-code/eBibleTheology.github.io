      Where is boasting then?.... There is no room nor reason for it, either in
      Jews or Gentiles: not in the Jews, who were very apt to boast of their
      being Abraham's seed; of their circumcision; of their being Israelites; of
      their having and keeping the law; of God being their God; and of their
      knowledge of him: nor in the Gentiles, who were ready to boast of their
      philosophy, wisdom, and learning; of their self-sufficiency, freewill, and
      of the things they had in their own power.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        It is excluded; it is shut out of doors; the key is turned upon it; it
        is not allowed of; it is entirely exploded:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by what law? of works? nay; for, that establishes boasting when men seek
        life, righteousness, and salvation by the works of it, and fancy they
        shall be able to attain them this way:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but by the law of faith: not by a law requiring faith; nor as if the
        Gospel was a law, a new law, a remedial law, a law of milder terms; but
        the word "law" here answers to the Hebrew word which signifies any
        "doctrine" or "instruction", and oftentimes the doctrine of the Gospel,
        as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003">Isa 2:3</a>, and here
        particularly, the doctrine of a sinner's justification by faith in the
        righteousness of Christ; according to which doctrine the most unlikely
        persons are justified, even ungodly persons, the worst and vilest of
        sinners; and that without any consideration of works, by faith only,
        which is freely given them; and by faith in Christ's righteousness only:
        so that there is not the least room for boasting in the creature, but
        all their boasting is in Christ, who is made unto them righteousness,
        and by whom they are justified.

      Therefore we conclude,.... This is the conclusion from the premises, the
      sum total of the whole account:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. The
        subject of justification is, "man", not in opposition to angels; nor
        does it design the Jew against the Gentile, though some have so thought;
        but the apostle names neither Jew nor Gentile, but "man", to show that
        Christ's righteousness is unto all, and every man, that believes, be he
        who he will; and is to be understood indefinitely, that every man that
        is justified is justified by faith. The means is "by faith", not
        habitually or actually considered; that is, either as an habit and
        principle infused into us, or as an act performed by us; but either
        organically, as it is a means of receiving Christ's righteousness; or
        objectively, as it denotes Christ the object of it: and all this is done
        "without works", of any sort; not by a faith which is without works, for
        such a faith is dead, and of no avail; but by faith without works joined
        to it, in the affair of justification; or by the righteousness of Christ
        imputed by God the Father, without any consideration of them, and
        received by faith, and relied upon by the believer, without any regard
        unto them.

      Is he the God of the Jews only?.... The Jews made their boast of him as
      such, and would not allow the Gentiles any interest in him: but
      <p></p>
      <p>
        is he not also of the Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also: God is the
        God both of Jews and Gentiles; not only as the Creator, preserver, and
        Governor of them, or as he has a right to demand worship and service of
        them, but as he is their covenant God; not by virtue of the covenant of
        circumcision, or by the Sinai Covenant, but by the covenant of grace; as
        appears by his loving them in Christ, choosing them in him, putting them
        into his hands, providing blessings of grace for them in him, and
        sending his Son to redeem them; by calling them by his grace; by their
        sanctification, adoption, pardon, and justification; by taking out of
        them a people for his name with whom he dwells, and of whom he takes
        care; and will never leave nor forsake: all which may lead us to observe
        the distinguishing grace of God, the happiness of our state and
        condition, and what encouragement we have for faith and hope in God.

      Seeing it is one God,.... God is one in nature and essence, though there
      are three persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; whence it
      appears, that he that is the God of the Jews, is also the God of the
      Gentiles, or there would be more gods than one; and that these are
      justified in one and the same manner, or God must be divided; for God, as
      he is one in nature, so he is one in will, in his promises, and in the
      methods of his grace:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision
        through faith. The objects of justification are "the circumcision", the
        circumcised Jews, and "the uncircumcision", the uncircumcised Gentiles;
        the circumcision of the one does not forward, and the uncircumcision of
        the other does not hinder, nor neither of them effect the grace of
        justification: the justifier of them is one and the same, who is God;
        and the matter of their justification is the same, which is the
        righteousness of Christ; and the manner of it, or the means of their
        comfortable apprehension of it, is the same; for those phrases, "by
        faith", and "through faith", mean one and the same thing; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009">Phi 3:9</a>.

      Do we then make void the law through faith?.... Which question is answered
      by way of detestatation,
      <p></p>
      <p>God forbid! and by asserting the contrary,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        yea, we establish the law. The law is not made void, neither by the
        grace nor doctrine of faith: not by the grace of faith; for that faith
        is not right which is not attended with works of righteousness; and
        those works are not right which do not flow from filth. Such a
        connection there is between faith and works; and so much do the one
        depend upon the other. Moreover, none but believers are capable of
        performing good works aright, and they do them, and they ought to do
        them: besides, faith, as a grace, looks to Christ, as the end of the law
        for righteousness, and therefore do not make it void. Nor is it made
        void by the doctrine of faith, and by the particular doctrine of a
        sinner's justification by faith in Christ's righteousness, which is here
        more especially intended; for though it is made void by it, as to any
        use of it for justification by the deeds thereof; yet its use in other
        respects is not set aside, such as to inform us of the mind and will of
        God, to discover and convince of sin, to show believers their deformity
        and imperfection, to render Christ and his righteousness more valuable,
        and to be a rule of walk and conversation to them; and it still remains
        a cursing and condemning law to Christless sinners, though justified
        ones are delivered from it as such: yea, the law is so far from being
        made void, that it is established by this doctrine; for by it the
        perpetuity of it is asserted, the spirituality of it is acknowledged,
        the perfect righteousness of it is secured: according to this doctrine
        all its demands are answered; whatever it requires it has, such as
        holiness of nature, perfect obedience to its precepts, and its full
        penalty borne: it is placed in the best hands, where it will ever
        remain; and a regard to it is enforced under the best influence, by the
        best of motives, and from the best of principles. It is indeed abolished
        as a covenant of works, and in this sense is made void to believers; and
        it is done away as to the form of administration of it by Moses; and it
        is destroyed as a yoke of bondage; and the people of God are free from
        the malediction of it, and condemnation by it, and so from its terror;
        yet it remains unalterable and unchangeable in the hands of Christ; the
        matter of it is always the same, and ever obligatory on believers, who,
        though they are freed from the curse of it, are not exempted from
        obedience to it: wherefore the law is not made void, so as to be
        destroyed and abolished in every sense, or to be rendered idle,
        inactive, useless, and insignificant; but, on the contrary, is made to
        stand, is placed on a sure basis and firm foundation, as the words used
        signify.
