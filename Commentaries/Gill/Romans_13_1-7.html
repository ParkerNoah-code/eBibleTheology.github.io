      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The principal things contained in this chapter, enjoined the saints, are
        the duties of subjection to magistrates, love to one another, and to all
        men, and temperance and chastity in themselves: it begins with duties
        relating to the civil magistrates, requiring obedience of everyone unto
        them (Rom 13:1) and that for
        these reasons, because the civil magistracy, or government, is by divine
        appointment; wherefore to obey them in things of a civil nature, is to
        obey God; and to resist them is to resist God; and also because of the
        pernicious consequence of such resistance, damnation to themselves (Rom 13:2) for the
        magistrate not only causes terror by penal laws, but he inflicts
        punishment on delinquents, and is the executioner of God's wrath and
        vengeance on such (Rom 13:3) and likewise
        because of the profit and advantage to obedient subjects; such not only
        have the good will and esteem of their rulers, and are commended by
        them, but are defended and protected in their persons and properties (Rom 13:3) moreover, the
        apostle enforces the necessity of subjection to them, not only in order
        to avoid punishment, but to answer a good conscience; this duty being
        according to the light of nature, and the dictates of a natural
        conscience; which if awake, must be uneasy with a contrary behaviour (Rom 13:5) and for the same
        reason he urges the payment of tribute to them, as well as on account of
        the reasonableness of it, taken from magistrates spending their time,
        and using their talents, in an attendance on the service of the public (Rom 13:6) and which is
        further confirmed by the general rule of justice and equity, or of doing
        that which is just and right to everyone, of which particulars are
        given (Rom 13:7) and then
        after a general exhortation to pay all sorts of debts owing to
        superiors, inferiors, or equals, the apostle passes to the debt of love
        owing to one another, and to all mankind; which is exhorted to on this
        consideration, that the performance of it is a fulfilling the law (Rom 13:8) which is proved,
        by showing that the several precepts of the law, of which an enumeration
        is given, are reducible to, and are included in love to our neighbours
        as ourselves (Rom 13:9)
        and since it is the nature of love not to work ill, but to do good to
        the neighbour, the conclusion follows, that it must be as asserted, that
        love is the fulfilment of the law, and ought by all means to be attended
        to, as a principal duty of religion (Rom 13:10) next the
        apostle proceeds to exhort the saints to a watchful, chaste, sober, and
        temperate course of life; as being perfectly agreeable to the privileges
        they enjoyed, to the present condition they were in, and to that future
        state of happiness they were in expectation of: he exhorts to be
        watchful and sober, and not indulge sleep and slothfulness, in
        consideration of the time in which they were, and with which they were
        acquainted, it being not night, but day; at least the one was wearing
        off, and the other coming on; the time of life being short, and the day
        of salvation approaching nearer and nearer (Rom 13:11) wherefore such
        actions should be done, as are agreeable to the day, and not the night,
        to light, and not darkness; and particularly such works of darkness are
        dissuaded from, which are contrary to temperance and sobriety, as
        rioting, and drunkenness; and to chastity, as chambering: and
        wantonness; and to peace and concord, as strife and envying, which
        frequently follow upon the former: and the chapter is concluded with an
        exhortation to faith in Christ, and an imitation of him, expressed in a
        figurative way by a metaphor, taken from the putting on of garments; and
        with a dehortation from an immoderate provision for the flesh, so as to
        promote, excite, and cherish, the lusts of it,

      Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,.... The apostle having
      finished his exhortations to this church, in relation to the several
      duties incumbent upon both officers and private Christians, as members of
      a church, and with reference to each other, and their moral conduct in the
      world; proceeds to advise, direct, and exhort them to such duties as were
      relative to them as members of a civil society; the former chapter
      contains his Christian Ethics, and this his Christian Politics. There was
      the greater reason to insist upon the latter, as well as on the former,
      since the primitive saints greatly lay under the imputation of being
      seditious persons and enemies to the commonwealth; which might arise from
      a very great number of them being Jews, who scrupled subjection to the
      Heathen magistrates, because they were the seed of Abraham, and by a law
      were not to set one as king over them, that was a stranger, and not their
      own brother, and very unwillingly bore the Roman yoke, and paid tribute to
      Caesar: hence the Christians in common were suspected to be of the same
      principles; and of all the Jews none were more averse to the payment of
      taxes to the Roman magistrates than the Galilaeans; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037">Act 5:37</a>. And this being the
      name by which Christ and his followers were commonly called, might serve
      to strengthen the above suspicion of them, and charge against them.
      Moreover, some Christians might be tempted to think that they should not
      be subject to Heathen magistrates; since they were generally wicked men,
      and violent persecutors of them; and that it was one branch of their
      Christian liberty to be freed from subjection to them: and certain it is,
      that there were a set of loose and licentious persons, who bore the name
      of Christians, that despised dominion, and spoke evil of dignities;
      wherefore the apostle judged it advisable especially to exhort the church
      of Rome, and the members who dwelt there, where was the seat of power and
      civil government, so to behave towards their superiors, that they might
      set a good example to the Christians in the several parts of the empire,
      and wipe off the aspersion that was cast upon them, as if they were
      enemies to magistracy and civil power. By "the higher powers", he means
      not angels, sometimes called principalities and powers; for unto these God
      hath not put in subjection his people under the Gospel dispensation; nor
      ecclesiastical officers, or those who are in church power and authority;
      for they do not bear the temporal sword, nor have any power to inflict
      corporeal punishment: but civil magistrates are intended, see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001">Tit 3:1</a>; and these not only
      supreme magistrates, as emperors and kings, but all inferior and
      subordinate ones, acting in commission under them, as appears from
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013">Pe1 2:13</a>, which are called
      "powers", because they are invested with power and authority over others,
      and have a right to exercise it in a proper way, and in proper cases; and
      the "higher" or super eminent ones, because they are set in high places,
      and have superior dignity and authority to others. The persons that are to
      be subject to them are "every soul"; not that the souls of men, distinct
      from their bodies, are under subjection to civil magistrates; for of all
      things they have the least to do with them, their power and jurisdiction
      not reaching to the souls, the hearts, and consciences of men, especially
      in matters of religion, but chiefly to their bodies, and outward civil
      concerns of life: but the meaning is, that every man that has a soul,
      every rational creature, ought to be subject to civil government. This is
      but his reasonable service, and which he should from his heart, and with
      all his soul, cheerfully perform. In short, the sense is, that every man
      should be subject: this is an Hebraism, a common way of speaking among the
      Jews, who sometimes denominate men from one part, and sometimes from
      another; sometimes from the body or flesh, thus "all flesh is grass" (Isa 40:6) that is, all men
      are frail; and sometimes front the soul, "all souls are mine" (Eze 18:4) all belong to me;
      as here, "every soul", that is, every man, all the individuals of mankind,
      of whatsoever sex, age, state, or condition, ecclesiastics not excepted:
      the pope, and his clergy, are not exempted from civil jurisdiction; nor
      any of the true ministers of the Gospel; the priests under the law were
      under the civil government; and so was Christ himself, and his apostles,
      who paid tribute to Caesar; yea, even Peter particularly, whose successor
      the pope of Rome pretends to be. "Subjection" to the civil magistrates
      designs and includes all duties relative to them; such as showing them
      respect, honour, and reverence suitable to their stations; speaking well
      of them, and their administration; using them with candour, not bearing
      hard upon them for little matters, and allowing for ignorance of the
      secret springs of many of their actions and conduct, which if known might
      greatly justify them; wishing well to them, and praying constantly,
      earnestly, and heartily for them; observing their laws and injunctions;
      obeying their lawful commands, which do not contradict the laws of God,
      nature, and right reason; and paying them their just dues and lawful
      tribute, to support them in their office and dignity:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for there is no power but of God; God is the fountain of all power and
        authority; the streams of power among creatures flow from him; the power
        that man has over all the creatures, the fowls of the air, the beasts of
        the field, and the fishes of the sea, is originally of God, and by a
        grant from him; the lesser powers, and the exercises of them, in the
        various relations men stand in to one another, are of God, as the power
        the husband has over the wife, parents over their children, and masters
        over their servants; and so the higher power that princes have over
        their subjects: for it is the God of heaven that sets up kings, as well
        as pulls them down; he is the King of kings, from whom they derive their
        power and authority, from whom they have the right of government, and
        all the qualifications for it; it is by him that kings reign, and
        princes decree justice.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The powers that be are ordained of God. The order of magistracy is of
        God; it is of his ordination and appointment, and of his ordering,
        disposing, and fixing in its proper bounds and limits. The several forms
        of government are of human will and pleasure; but government itself is
        an order of God. There may be men in power who assume it of themselves,
        and are of themselves, and not of God; and others that abuse the power
        that is lodged in them; who, though they are by divine permission, yet
        not of God's approbation and good will. And it is observable, that the
        apostle speaks of powers, and not persons, at least, not of persons, but
        under the name of powers, to show that he means not this, or the other
        particular prince or magistrate, but the thing itself, the office and
        dignity of magistracy itself; for there may be some persons, who may of
        themselves usurp this office, or exercise it in a very illegal way, who
        are not of God, nor to be subject to by men. The apostle here both uses
        the language, and speaks the sentiments of his countrymen the Jews, who
        are wont to call magistrates, "powers"; hence those sayings were used
        among them; says Shemaiah (t),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"twvrl edwtt la, "be not too familiar with the power".''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>that is, with a magistrate, which oftentimes is dangerous. Again,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "says (u) Rabban Gamaliel, , "take heed of the power" (i.e. of
        magistrates), for they do not suffer a man to come near them, but in
        necessity, and then they appear as friends for their own advantage, but
        will not stand by a man in the time of distress.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Moreover, after this manner they explain (w)
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#008">Pro 5:8</a>,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        ""remove thy way far from her", this is heresy; "and come not nigh the
        door of her house", , "this is the power". The gloss on it is,
        magistrates, because they set their eyes upon rich men to kill them, and
        take away their substance.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And a little after it is observed,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        ""the horse leech hath two daughters, crying, give, give" (Pro 30:15) it is asked,
        what is the meaning of give, give? Says Mar Ukba, there are two
        daughters which cry out of hell, and say in this world, give, give, and
        they are heresy, "and the civil power".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The gloss on this place is,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Heresy cries, bring a sacrifice to the idol; "Civil Power" cries, bring
        money, and gifts, and revenues, and tribute to the king.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, they look upon civil government to be of divine
        appointment. They say (x), that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"no man is made a governor below, except they proclaim him above;''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        i.e. unless he is ordained of God: yea, they allow (y) the Roman empire
        to be of God, than which no government was more disagreeable to them.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "When R. Jose ben Kisma was sick, R. Chanina ben Tradion went to visit
        him; he said unto him, Chanina, my brother, my brother, knowest thou not
        that this nation, (the Romans) , "have received their empire" from God?
        for it hath laid waste his house, and hath burnt his temple, and has
        slain his saints, and destroyed his good men, and yet it endures.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Nay, they frequently affirm (z), that the meanest office of power among
        men was of divine appointment. This is the apostle's first argument for
        subjection to the civil magistrate.

      Whosoever therefore resisteth the power,.... The office of magistracy, and
      such as are lawfully placed in it, and rightly exercise it; who denies
      that there is, or ought to be any such order among men, despises it, and
      opposes it, and withdraws himself from it, and will not be subject to it
      in any form:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        resisteth the ordinance of God, the will and appointment of God, whose
        pleasure it is that there should be such an office, and that men should
        be subject to it. This is not to be understood, as if magistrates were
        above the laws, and had a lawless power to do as they will without
        opposition; for they are under the law, and liable to the penalty of it,
        in case of disobedience, as others; and when they make their own will a
        law, or exercise a lawless tyrannical power, in defiance of the laws of
        God, and of the land, to the endangering of the lives, liberties, and
        properties of subjects, they may be resisted, as Saul was by the people
        of Israel, when he would have took away the life of Jonathan for the
        breach of an arbitrary law of his own, and that too without the
        knowledge of it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1014.htm#045">Sa1 14:45</a>; but the apostle
        is speaking of resisting magistrates in the right discharge of their
        office, and in the exercise of legal power and authority:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and they that resist them, in this sense,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall receive to themselves damnation; that is, punishment; either
        temporal, and that either by the hand of the magistrate himself, who has
        it in his power to punish mutiny, sedition, and insurrection, and any
        opposition to him in the just discharge of his duty; or at the hand of
        God, in righteous judgment, for their disobedience to an ordinance of
        his; as in the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, who opposed themselves
        both to the civil and sacred government of the people of Israel,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num026.htm#009">Num 26:9</a>; and were
        swallowed up alive in the earth (Num 26:10) or eternal
        punishment, unless the grace of God prevents; for "the blackness of
        darkness is reserved for ever" (Jde 1:13) for such
        persons, who, among other of their characters, are said to "despise
        dominion, and speak evil of dignities",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#008">Jde 1:8</a>. This is another
        argument persuading to subjection to magistrates.

      For rulers are not a terror to good works,.... That is, to them that do
      good works in a civil sense; who behave well in the neighbourhoods, towns,
      cities, and countries where they dwell. The apostle seems to anticipate an
      objection made against governors, as if there was something very terrible
      and formidable in them; and which might be taken up from the last clause
      of the preceding verse; and which he removes by observing, that governors
      neither do, nor ought to inject terror into men that behave well, obey the
      laws, and keep a good decorum among their fellow subjects, not doing any
      injury to any man's person, property, and estate. The Jews (a) have a
      saying,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that a governor that injects more fear into the people, than is for the
        honour of God, shall be punished, and shall not see his son a disciple
        of a wise man.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But to the evil; to wicked men, who make no conscience of doing hurt to
        their fellow creatures, by abusing their persons, defrauding them of
        their substance, and by various illicit methods doing damage to them; to
        such, rulers are, and ought to be terrors; such are to be menaced, and
        threatened with inflicting upon them the penalty of the laws they break;
        and which ought to be inflicted on them by way of punishment to them,
        and for the terror of others. R. Chanina, the Sagan of the priests (b),
        used to say,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "pray for the peace of the kingdom, for if there was no "fear", (i.e. a
        magistrate to inject fear,) one man would devour another alive.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Wilt thou not then be afraid of the power? of the civil magistrate, in
        power and authority, to oppose him, to refuse subjection to him, to
        break the laws, which, according to his office, he is to put in
        execution.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Do that which is good: in a civil sense, between man and man, by
        complying with the laws of the land, which are not contrary to the laws
        of God; for of doing good in a spiritual and religious sense he is no
        judge:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and thou shalt have praise of the same; shall be commended as a good
        neighbour, a good citizen, and a good commonwealth's man; an honest,
        quiet, peaceable man, that does not disturb the peace of civil society,
        but strengthens and increases it.

      For he is the minister of God to thee for good,.... He is a minister of
      God's appointing and commissioning, that acts under him, and for him, is a
      kind of a vicegerent of his, and in some, sense represents him; and which
      is another reason why men ought to be subject to him; and especially since
      he is appointed for their "good", natural, moral, civil, and spiritual, as
      Pareus observes: for natural good, for the protection of men's natural
      lives, which otherwise would be in continual danger from wicked men; for
      moral good, for the restraining of vice, and encouragement of virtue;
      profaneness abounds exceedingly, as the case is, but what would it do if
      there were no laws to forbid it, or civil magistrates to put them in
      execution? for civil good, for the preservation of men's properties,
      estates, rights, and liberties, which would be continually invaded, and
      made a prey of by others; and for spiritual and religious good, as many
      princes and magistrates have been; a sensible experience of which we have
      under the present government of these kingdoms, allowing us a liberty to
      worship God according to our consciences, none making us afraid, and is a
      reason why we should yield a cheerful subjection to it:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid: of the punishment of such
        evil threatened by law, and to be inflicted by the civil magistrate;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for he beareth not the sword in vain. The "sword" is an emblem of the
        power of life and death, the civil magistrate is invested with, and
        includes all sorts of punishment he has a right to inflict; and this
        power is not lodged in him in vain; he may and ought to make use of it
        at proper times, and upon proper persons:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for he is the minister of God; as is said before, he has his mission,
        commission, power and authority from him; and is
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a revenge to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil; he is a defender of
        the laws, a vindicator of divine justice, an avenger of the wrongs of
        men; and his business is to inflict proper punishment, which is meant by
        wrath, upon delinquents.

      Wherefore ye must needs be subject,.... To the higher powers, to the civil
      magistrates; there is a necessity of it, because magistracy is God's
      ordinance, it is for the good of men; and such that oppose it will
      severely smart for it: but subjection to it from Christians should be,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not only for wrath; through fear of punishment, and for the sake of
        escaping it; either the wrath of men or of God, in this or the other
        world:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but also for conscience sake: to keep conscience clear, to exercise a
        good one void of offence towards God and men; for natural reason,
        conscience itself, dictates that there ought to be such order among men,
        that civil government should take place, and ought to be submitted to.

      For, for this cause pay you tribute also,.... To show that we are subject
      to the higher powers, and as a proof and evidence of our subjection to
      them, we do and ought to pay tribute to them, to support them in their
      office and dignity; and this is done not for fear of trouble, of distress
      on goods and estate, or imprisonment of person, but for conscience sake:
      payment of taxes is not a mere matter of prudence, and done to avoid
      dangerous consequence, but is and ought to be a case of conscience;
      whatever is anyone's due, and of right belongs to him, conscience dictates
      it ought to be paid him; as therefore it tells a man, that whatever is
      God's should be rendered to him, so whatever is Caesar's, should be given
      him; and indeed to do otherwise, to refuse to pay tribute, or by any
      fraudulent means to deprive the civil magistrate of his due, is not only
      to do an injury to him, but to the whole body politic, which has a greater
      concern therein than he himself; and such a person forfeits all right and
      claim to his protection:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for they are God's ministers. This is another reason why tribute should
        be paid them, not only to testify subjection to them, and keep
        conscience clear, but because they are called unto, and put into this
        high office by God; for promotion to such honour and high places comes
        not from east, west, north, or south; but is by the providence of God,
        who puts down, and sets up at pleasure; they are his vicegerents, they
        act under him, are in his stead, and represent his majesty; and
        therefore, in some sort, what is done to them is done to him:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        attending continually upon this very thing; not of laying, collecting,
        and receiving tribute, but of service and ministry under God, for the
        welfare of their subjects; for rightly to administer the office of
        magistracy requires great pains, care, diligence, and assiduity; and as
        great wisdom and thoughtfulness in making laws for the good of the body,
        so a diligent constant concern to put them in execution, to secure the
        lives of subjects from cut throats and murderers, and their properties
        and estates from thieves and robbers; and they are not only obliged
        diligently to attend to such service at home, but to keep a good lookout
        abroad, and penetrate into, and watch the designs of foreign enemies, to
        defend from their invasions, and fight for their country; that the
        inhabitants thereof may live peaceable and quiet lives, enjoying their
        respective rights and privileges; and since therefore civil government
        is a business of so much care, and since our rulers are so solicitous,
        and constantly concerned for our good, and which cannot be done without
        great expense, as well as diligence, we ought cheerfully to pay tribute
        to them.

      Render therefore to all their dues,.... To all princes, magistrates, and
      officers, that are placed over us, from the supreme governor to the lowest
      officer under him, should we render as a due debt, and not as a mere gift,
      whatever belongs to them, or is proper for them for the due discharge of
      their office, to encourage in it, and support the dignity of it, whether
      external or internal:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom. These two words
        include all sorts of levies, taxes, subsidies, &amp;c. and the former
        may particularly design what is laid on men's persons and estates, as
        poll money, land tax, &amp;c. and the latter, what arises from the
        exportation and importation of goods, to and from foreign parts:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        fear to whom fear; not of punishment; for a good subject has no reason
        to fear the civil magistrate in this sense, only the man that does evil,
        the malefactor; as for the good neighbour, citizen, and subject, he
        loves the magistrate the more, the more diligent he is in putting the
        laws in execution against wicked men; but this is to be understood of a
        fear of offending, and especially of a reverence bore in the mind, and
        expressed by outward actions, and such as has going with it a cheerful
        obedience to all lawful commands:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        honour to whom honour; there is an honour due to all men, according to
        their respective rank and station, and the relation they stand in to
        each other; so servants are to honour their masters, children their
        parents, wives their husbands, and subjects their princes; all inferior
        magistrates are to be honoured in their place, and more especially the
        king as supreme, in thought, word, and gesture; see
