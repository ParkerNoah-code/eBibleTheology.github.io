      For circumcision verily profiteth,.... The plea from circumcision in
      favour of the Jews, and their acceptance with God, and justification
      before him, is here, and in the following verses, considered. The apostle
      allows that circumcision was profitable; which must be understood whilst
      it was in force, before the abrogation of it, for since, it is not
      profitable but pernicious; and then it was only profitable, in case the
      law was kept:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        if thou keepest the law; that is, perfectly; for circumcision obliged
        persons to keep the whole law. Now the circumcised Jews did not keep it
        in such sense; wherefore circumcision was of no use to them, but, on the
        contrary, was an handwriting against them.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
        uncircumcision; that is, it is not accounted circumcision; it is of no
        avail; such a man was all one as an uncircumcised Gentile, and appeared
        to be uncircumcised in a spiritual sense: the apostle perhaps alludes to
        a practice among some of the Jews, to bring on and draw over the
        foreskin, after they had been circumcised; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018">Co1 7:18</a>.

      Therefore if the uncircumcision keep,.... These words are spoken
      hypothetically; if any such persons could be found among the Gentiles who
      keep the whole law of God; and can only be absolutely understood of such,
      who from a principle of grace act in obedience to the law; as in the hands
      of Christ, and who look to Christ as the fulfilling end of it, for
      righteousness; in whom they keep
      <p></p>
      <p>the righteousness of the law perfectly:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? by this
        question it is suggested, that an uncircumcised Gentile, who keeps the
        law as in the hands of Christ, and under the influences of his Spirit
        and grace, and keeps it in Christ, is reckoned a circumcised person in a
        spiritual sense, and must be preferable to a circumcised Jew that breaks
        it.

      </p>
      And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature,.... That is, the
      Gentiles, who are by nature uncircumcised; for as circumcision was by the
      command of God, and performed by the art of men, uncircumcision is by
      nature, and what men naturally have. Now
      <p></p>
      <p>if it, such persons,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>fulfil the law in Christ, they will</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        judge thee, the circumcision: and condemn, as Noah condemned the old
        world (Heb 11:7) and the men of
        Nineveh and the queen of the south will condemn the men of that
        generation, in which Christ lived,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041">Mat 12:41</a>.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Who by the letter and circumcision transgress the law; that is, either
        by the law, which is "the letter", and "by circumcision", or "by
        circumcision which is in the letter" (Rom 2:29) sin being
        increased by the prohibitions of the moral law, and the rituals of the
        ceremonial law, and the more so by a dependence upon an obedience to
        either of them, or both, for justification.

      For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly,.... The apostle removes the
      plea in favour of the Jews, taken from their name and privilege, by
      distinguishing between a Jew and a Jew, and between circumcision and
      circumcision: "he is not a Jew which is one outwardly"; by mere name,
      nature, nation, religion, and profession:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; which takes
        away the flesh of the foreskin, but not the carnality of the heart;
        leaves a mark upon the flesh, but no impression on the mind. This is
        nothing, is not the true, solid, substantial, spiritual circumcision,
        which only avails in the sight of God.
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      But he is a Jew which is one inwardly,.... Who has an internal work of
      grace upon his soul: who has not only an outward name, but an inward
      nature; not the law of God in the hand, but in the heart; not an external
      righteousness only, but internal holiness; and who is not a mere outward
      court worshipper, but a worshipper of God in Spirit and in truth. The Jews
      have a (e) saying themselves,
      <p></p>
      <p>"that whosoever denies idolatry, , "is called a Jew":''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        so that, according to them, this is a name that is not confined to
        themselves, but belongs to all such who truly fear and worship God; and
        they say, in the same place, that Pharaoh's daughter was called "a
        Jewess", because she denied idolatry, and went down to wash herself from
        the idols of her father's house. And elsewhere (f),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that faith does not depend upon circumcision, but upon the heart: he
        that believes not as he should, circumcision does not make him a Jew;
        and he that believes as he ought, he indeed is a Jew, though he is not
        circumcised.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And circumcision is that of the heart; which God requires, and he
        himself promises to give (Deu 10:16) upon which last
        passage, a very noted Jew (g) has this observation, , "this is the
        circumcision of the heart"; the very phrase the apostle here uses:
        circumcision of the flesh was typical of this, which lies in a godly
        sorrow for sin, in a putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, and
        in renouncing a man's own righteousness in the business of
        justification. The ancient Jews had some notion of this typical use of
        circumcision. So Philo the Jew says (h), that circumcision taught , "the
        cutting off of all pleasures and affections": and elsewhere he says (i):
        it is a symbol of two things particularly; the one is the cutting off of
        pleasures, as before; and the other is the removal of arrogancy, that
        grievous disease of the soul: and in another place (k) he calls purity,
        or chastity, , "the circumcision of circumcision". Now this our apostle
        says is
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in the spirit; meaning either the spirit or soul of man, which is the
        seat and subject of it; or the Spirit of God, who is the author of it:
        the Ethiopic version reads it, "by the Holy Ghost":
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and not in the letter; or "by the letter" of the law; but the Holy Ghost
        produces this spiritual work instrumentally, by the preaching of the
        Gospel. To which the apostle adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whose praise is not of men, but of God; referring not to circumcision
        immediately spoken of before, but to the Jew who is one inwardly: and
        alludes to the name Judah, from whence the Jews are called, which comes
        from the word which signifies to "praise"; and intimates here, that such
        persons must not expect praise from men, who are only taken, with
        outward things, but from God, who searches and knows the heart.
