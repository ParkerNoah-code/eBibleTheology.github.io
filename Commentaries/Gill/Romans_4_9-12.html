      Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only?.... That is, upon
      the circumcised Jews; are they the only persons that partake of this
      happiness? the word "only" is rightly supplied, and is in the Claromontane
      exemplar used by Beza, and in the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or upon the uncircumcision also? upon the uncircumcised Gentiles; do not
        they likewise share in this blessedness?
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for we say, that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. The
        design of these words with the following, is to prove that the blessing
        of justification belongs to Gentiles as well as Jews, and that it is by
        faith, and not by circumcision; which is done by observing the state and
        condition Abraham was in when justified.

      </p>
      How was it then reckoned?.... The Arabic version adds, "and when"; and the
      Ethiopic version reads it, "when was Abraham justified?" expressing the
      sense, not the words of the original text, with which agree the following
      questions:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? that is, was he
        justified, or his faith reckoned to him for righteousness, when he was a
        circumcised, or an uncircumcised person?
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not in circumcision; or when he was circumcised; for when it was said of
        him, that "he believed in the Lord", and "he counted it to him for
        righteousness",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006">Gen 15:6</a>, he was then
        uncircumcised, and remained so many years after: for this was before the
        birth of Ishmael, and Ishmael was "thirteen" years of age when he and
        his father Abraham were circumcised; so that it must be "fourteen"
        years, or thereabout, before his circumcision, that this declaration of
        his being a justified person was made; wherefore the apostle rightly
        adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but in uncircumcision; or whilst an uncircumcised person: hence it
        clearly appears that circumcision could not be the cause of his
        justification, since it followed it; and if Abraham when uncircumcised
        was a justified person, as it is certain he was, why may not
        uncircumcised Gentiles be justified also? and especially when it is
        observed, that the covenant made with Abraham when uncircumcised,
        included the Gentiles; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003">Gen 12:3</a>.

      And he received the sign of circumcision,.... Or "the sign circumcision",
      as the Syriac version reads it, and so the Alexandrian copy, and two of
      Stephens's; that is, Abraham received at the hands of God, the commandment
      of circumcision, which was a "sign" or token of the covenant; not of
      grace, but of that peculiar covenant God made with Abraham and his natural
      seed, concerning their enjoyment of the land of Canaan; and which was a
      distinctive sign or badge, which distinguished the posterity of Abraham
      from other people, and was also a typical one; not of baptism, for
      circumcision was peculiar to Abraham's natural seed, whereas baptism is
      not, but was administered to Gentiles as well as Jews; circumcision was
      confined to males only, not so baptism; circumcision bears no likeness to,
      nor any resemblance with baptism, whereas there is always some likeness
      and agreement between the type and the antitype; besides, if this had been
      the case, circumcision would have ceased when baptism took place, whereas
      it is certain it did not, but continued in full force with the rest of the
      ceremonies until the death of Christ; and it is as certain, that "baptism"
      was administered and continued to be administered three or four years
      before that time; which fully demonstrates the falsehood of that
      assertion, that baptism succeeds or comes in the room of circumcision;
      whereas baptism was in full force before circumcision was out of date: but
      circumcision was a typical sign of Christ, as all the ceremonies of the
      law were, and of the shedding of his blood, to cleanse from all sin,
      original and actual, and also of the circumcision of the heart. And was,
      moreover,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a seal of the righteousness of faith; or which "sign" was "a seal"; and
        so it signifies the same as before; "signs, so they call seals", says
        Harpocratian (f), and "to be signed", he says, is used, "instead of
        being sealed": or it may be expressive of something else, as that
        circumcision was a seal, not for secrecy, but for certainty; it being a
        confirmation, not merely of the sincerity of Abraham's faith, but of his
        justifying righteousness, which was not his faith, but that which his
        faith looked to; and
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>which he had, both faith and righteousness,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        yet being uncircumcised: whence it follows, that he was not justified by
        his circumcision, but by a righteousness which he had before he was
        circumcised, or otherwise his circumcision could not have been a seal of
        it: though this clause, "which he had, yet being uncircumcised", may be
        rendered, "which should be in the uncircumcision", that is, in the
        uncircumcised Gentiles; and the sense be, that circumcision was a seal
        to Abraham, and gave assurance to him that he should be the father of
        many nations in a spiritual sense; and that the righteousness of faith
        which he had, should also come upon, and be imputed to the uncircumcised
        Gentiles; and accordingly it may be observed, that this seal was
        continued in full force on his natural seed, until this promise began to
        take place, and then it was abolished: this seal was broken off when the
        middle wall of partition was broken down, and the word of righteousness
        and faith, or the Gospel preaching justification by the righteousness of
        Christ, was ordered to be published to the Gentile world. It may be
        inquired whether circumcision being called a seal, will prove that
        baptism is a seal of the covenant? I answer, that circumcision was only
        a seal to Abraham of a peculiar covenant made with him, and of a
        particular promise made to him, and was it to be admitted a seal of the
        covenant of grace, it will not prove baptism to be such; since, as has
        been observed, baptism does not succeed it in place, in time, and use;
        and could this be allowed that it succeeds it, and is a seal of the
        righteousness of faith, as that was, it can only be a seal to them that
        have both faith and righteousness, and not to them that have neither; it
        would only at most be a seal to believers. But, alas! not ordinances,
        but other things more valuable than they, are the seals of the covenant,
        and of believers; the blood of Christ is the seal, and the only seal of
        the covenant of grace, by which its promises and blessings are ratified
        and confirmed; and the Holy Spirit is the only earnest, pledge, seal,
        and sealer of the saints, until the day of redemption. The apostle uses
        the word "seal" concerning circumcision, it being a word his countrymen
        made use of when they spoke of it, thus paraphrasing on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol003.htm#008">Sol 3:8</a>; they say (g),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "everyone of them was sealed, , "with the seal of circumcision" upon
        their flesh, as Abraham was sealed in his flesh:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not
        circumcised; that is, his circumcision was a seal unto him that he
        should be so, which explains and confirms the sense of the former
        clause; not a father of the uncircumcised Gentiles by natural
        generation, for so he was only the father of the Jews, but of them as
        they were believers; and not so called because he was the author of
        their faith, but because they have the same sort of faith he had:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that righteousness might be imputed to them also; not Abraham's faith
        and righteousness, nor their own, but the righteousness of Christ
        received by faith, which is unto all, and upon all them that believe,
        without any difference of Jew or Gentile. Now when the apostle styles
        Abraham the father of "all" believers, even of uncircumcised ones, he
        says no other than what the Jews frequently own. Says one (h) of them,
        speaking of the Ishmaelites;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "they are the seed of Abraham, who was , "the head of them that
        believe?"''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and says (i) another,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Hagar might bring the firstfruits, and read, as it is said to Abraham,
        "a father of, many nations have I made thee",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#005">Gen 17:5</a>; for he is , "the
        father of the whole world", who enter under the wings of the Shekinah;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and says the same writer elsewhere (k), having mentioned the above
        passage,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "they said in times past, thou wast the father of the Syrians, but now
        thou art "the father of the whole world"; wherefore every stranger may
        say this, "as thou hast sworn to our fathers",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#020">Mic 7:20</a>; for Abraham was
        "the father of the whole world"; seeing, , "he has taught the true
        faith".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The apostle reasons on what they themselves allow, to prove that the
        blessedness of justification comes not only upon the Jews, but upon the
        Gentiles also.

      And the father of circumcision,.... So the Jews call Abraham (l), "the
      head of those that are circumcised"; and (m), "the head to them that are
      circumcised"; but the apostle here says, he is a father
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to them who are not of the circumcision only; not to the Jews only, in a
        spiritual sense, and not to all of them, since some were "of Israel",
        who were not Israel, not Israelites indeed, or true believers;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but to such also who walk in the steps of that faith of our father
        Abraham, which he had, being yet uncircumcised; that is, who have the
        same faith he had; imitate and follow him in the exercise of faith; walk
        by faith, as he did when he was uncircumcised, as they are; and so the
        Jews say (n),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Abraham is the father of all, , "that go after him in his faith".''
