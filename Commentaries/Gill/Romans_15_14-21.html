      And I myself also am persuaded of you,.... This is said by way of
      prevention to an objection that might he made to the apostle's prayers and
      exhortations by the Romans. What does the apostle mean by all this? what
      does he think of us, or take us to be? men that live in malice to one
      another, devoid of all humanity, and mutual respect? a parcel of fools and
      ignorant men, that know nothing of divine things? and though there may be
      some that are much to be blamed for their conduct and carriage to their
      fellow Christians, what, are there none among us fit to give advice and
      admonition? To which the apostle replies, that he was far from
      entertaining such thoughts of them; that though he had not seen them in
      person, yet he had had such an account of their faith and practice, which
      were famous throughout the world, that he was thoroughly persuaded of
      better things of them, though he thus spake; and therefore, to mollify
      them, and abate their resentment, he adds,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        my brethren; testifying his affection to them, owning the spiritual
        relation they stood in to him, and declaring the great esteem he had for
        them, and the high opinion he had of them: saying,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that ye also are full of goodness; not naturally, for there is no good
        thing in men by nature, but what they had was from the Spirit of God,
        whose fruit is "goodness": and by which may be meant, either the good
        gifts of the Spirit of God, or rather his graces, even the good work of
        grace in general, and which is goodness itself: it comes from a good
        cause, the good Spirit of God; is good in its own nature, not having the
        least mixture or tincture of evil in it; and good in its effects, since
        it makes and denominates a man a good man; now these saints might be
        said to be full of this, to denote the abundance, the superabundance of
        grace in this work: or particularly beneficence, humanity, and sympathy
        to fellow Christians, may be intended. The Vulgate Latin version reads,
        "full of love": but the copies and eastern versions read as we do.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Filled with all knowledge; not with every sort of knowledge, with the
        knowledge of all languages, or of all the arts and sciences, of all
        things, natural and political; but with all spiritual knowledge relating
        to God, his nature and perfections, his mind and will; to Christ and the
        work of redemption by him; to the Spirit, and the operations of his
        grace; to the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; to their duty to God,
        fellow creatures, and fellow Christians; in short, with all knowledge
        necessary to salvation, though as yet not perfect, and which will not be
        in this world, but in another:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        able also to admonish one another; as they must be, since they were both
        good and knowing; goodness and knowledge are necessary to admonition,
        and qualify persons for it: if a man is not a good man himself, he is
        not fit to admonish another; and if he has not knowledge, he will not be
        able to do it as it should be; and without humanity and tenderness, he
        will not perform it aright, and with success; but all this being in
        these persons, they were able and fit for it. Some copies read it, "able
        also to admonish others"; so the Syriac version renders; which makes the
        expression still stronger, and enlarges their praise and commendation.

      Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you,.... Or
      freely, in taking notice of their party contentions and ill usage of each
      other, and in reproving, advising, and exhorting them; and which he
      excuses by observing, that it was,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in some sort, or "in part" only; meaning either that it was only in some
        part of the epistle he had took such a liberty, which is the sense of
        the Arabic version, which renders it, "in some parts of the oration"; or
        else that he had regard not to all of them, but to some only, to a part
        of the church who were most culpable; and did not design a charge
        against them all, and that what he said should be applied to the whole
        body; or rather that the boldness and freedom he had taken was bat in
        some sort, it was but in part: this he says to mitigate it, and that it
        might not be thought to be so large as it might appear at first; it was
        but "a little more boldly", that he wrote unto them, as the Syriac
        renders it; for this clause is not to be read in connection with the
        word "written", as if the apostle had only wrote of the doctrines of
        grace in some sort, or in part, for he declared the whole counsel of
        God, and never kept back anything profitable to the churches: he adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as putting you in mind; which is also said to excuse his writing, and
        the manner of it; he did not take upon him to be their teacher and
        instructor, to inform them of things they knew nothing of; only to be
        their monitor, to put them in mind of and refresh their memories with
        what they had been well instructed and established in before; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#012">Pe2 1:12</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        because of the grace that is given to me of God; meaning not the
        doctrine of "grace, concerning" which, as the Ethiopic version renders
        it, he was putting them in mind; nor the internal grace of the Spirit,
        by which he was inclined and assisted to write unto them; but the grace
        of apostleship, or that high office, which, by the grace of God, and not
        because of any merits of his, he was called unto: this he mentions also
        to excuse the freedom of his writing; since what he did was in
        consequence of, pursuant and agreeably to, his office as an apostle; and
        therefore could not have answered it to God, or them, if he had not done
        it; wherefore he hoped it would be took well by them.

      </p>
      That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ,.... The office of
      apostleship is here amplified and enlarged on, and the ends shown for
      which that grace was given to him, that he should be a minister; not in
      holy things about the temple, as the priests and Levites were; or a
      teacher of the law, some were fond of; but a minister of Christ, one that
      was made so by him, was qualified and sent forth to minister in his name
      to men; and who was a preacher of him; Jesus Christ, and him crucified,
      was the grand subject of his ministrations; he adds,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to the Gentiles; for to them, though not to the exclusion of the Jews,
        was he appointed a minister by Christ, and sent by him to them; among
        them he chiefly ministered, and was particularly and eminently useful to
        them; and this is another reason why the Romans ought to bear with a
        little boldness and freedom in writing to them, since he was the apostle
        of the Gentiles:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        ministering the Gospel of God; not the service of the temple, nor the
        traditions of the elders, nor the law of Moses, nor the morality of the
        Heathens; but the Gospel, of which God is the author, whose grace is the
        subject, and whose glory is the end; and is good news from him to the
        chief of sinners; to the preaching of which the apostle was separated by
        him:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that the offering up of the Gentiles; not the offering the Gentiles
        offered up, their prayers, praises, or good works, though these are
        acceptable to God through Christ; but the Gentiles themselves, by the
        offering up of whom is meant their conversion; which was the end of the
        apostle's ministering the Gospel among them, and in which he was the
        happy instrument. The allusion is to the priests slaying and offering up
        sacrifices under the law. The apostle was a priest in a figurative and
        improper sense; the sacrifices he offered up were not slain beasts, but
        men, the Gentiles, cut to the heart by the sword of the Spirit, the
        ministry of the Gospel; whose inside being laid open to them, and they
        brought to a sense of their lost condition, and need of Christ, were,
        through the power of divine grace attending the word, made willing to
        offer, or give up themselves to the Lord, to be saved by him, and him
        only: this the apostle, as an instrument, was concerned in; and all his
        view was, that it
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        might be acceptable; that is, to God, as nothing is more so to him than
        a broken and a contrite heart, or souls brought to a sense of
        themselves; and to believe in Christ, and submit to his righteousness;
        and then both ministers and converts are unto God, a sweet savour of
        Christ:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        being sanctified by the Holy Ghost; this is said in allusion to the
        washing of the sacrifices under the law; and intimates, that the
        Gentiles, though unclean by nature and practice, yet being sanctified by
        the Spirit of God, whose proper work it is to sanctify, become an
        acceptable, being an holy sacrifice to an holy God.

      I have therefore whereof I may glory,.... Not in himself, for he that
      taught others not to glory in men, would not glory in himself; not in his
      carnal descent and fleshly privileges; nor in his knowledge of, and
      compliance with, the ceremonies of the law; nor in his legal, moral, and
      civil righteousness before God; nor in his gifts and attainments, as
      merited and procured by himself; nor in his labours in the ministry, and
      the success of it, as of himself: but
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through Jesus Christ; or "in Jesus Christ", as read the Vulgate Latin,
        Syriac, and Arabic versions; in what Christ was unto him, wisdom,
        righteousness, sanctification, and redemption: he could boast of what he
        had from him, and through him, even of all spiritual blessings in him;
        and of a large measure of grace he had received from him; and of great
        and eminent gifts Christ had bestowed on him; he gloried in his cross,
        and boasted of a crucified Jesus, whom others despised; and whom he made
        the subject of his ministry, and took delight in preaching: and freely
        owned that all he did was through Christ strengthening him; and that all
        his success in his work was owing to him, and of this he had to glory:
        and which was
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in those things which pertain to God; not "with God", as the Syriac
        reads it; for though in some cases it may be lawful to glory before men,
        yet not before God, or in his presence: nor is it anything a man may
        glory in, not in his own things, but in the things of God; in things
        relating to the Gospel of God, to the pure preaching of it, to the
        furtherance and spread of it, and the recommending of it to others; to
        the worship and ordinances of God, and a spiritual attendance on them;
        to the grace of God, and the magnifying of that in the business of
        salvation; and to the glory of God, which ought to be the chief end of
        all actions, natural, moral, and religious, and whether private or
        public. The apostle has chiefly reference to his ministerial function,
        and the things of God relating to that, in which he was employed; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001">Heb 5:1</a>.

      </p>
      For I will not dare to speak of any of those things,.... He suggests that
      the false teachers did speak of things which were not done by them at all,
      and much less were what Christ had done by them; and signifies that he was
      a conscientious man, and could speak nothing but what was truth; his
      conscience would not suffer him, nor could he allow himself to make
      mention of anything, that was not done by him, as if it was; nor of
      anything that was done by himself, nor of anything that was done, as if it
      was done by himself, but as it was wrought by Christ; nor had he any need
      to speak of any other things which he had wrought himself, as he could not
      of what he had not wrought at all; or, as he says,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which Christ hath not wrought by me: signifying that what he had
        wrought, and which he could with good conscience speak of to the honour
        of Christ, and the glory of his grace, were not wrought by himself, but
        what Christ wrought by him; he was only the instrument, Christ was the
        efficient cause: as a Christian, it was not he that lived, but Christ
        lived in him; as a minister, it was not he that spoke, but Christ spoke
        in him; nor was it he that laboured, but the grace of Christ that was
        with him; much less was it he that converted souls, but Christ did it by
        him:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to make the Gentiles obedient; the nations of the world, who had been
        brought up in blindness and ignorance of God, in rebellion and
        disobedience to him. The Gospel was sent among them, and was blessed
        unto them, to make them, of disobedient, obedient ones; not to men, but
        to God; not to magistrates and ministers, though they were taught to be
        so to both, but to Christ; to him as a priest, by being made willing to
        be saved by him, and him only, renouncing their own works, and
        disclaiming all other ways of salvation; and to submit to his
        righteousness for their justification before God, and acceptance with
        him; and to deal with his precious blood for pardon and cleansing; to
        rely on his sacrifice for the atonement of their sins, and to make use
        of him as the new and living way to the Father, as their one and only
        mediator, advocate, and intercessor; and to him as a prophet, to the
        faith of the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; not barely by hearing it,
        and notionally assenting to it, but by embracing it heartily, and
        professing it publicly and sincerely; and to him as a King, by owning
        him as such, and as theirs; and by subjecting to his ordinances, and
        obeying his commands in faith and fear, and from love to him: the means
        whereby these persons were brought to the obedience of Christ, and of
        faith, are
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by word and deed; or "deeds", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic
        versions read: by the former is meant, the word of the Gospel and the
        preaching of it, being sent unto them, and coming with power, and not as
        the word of man, but as the word of God; and by the latter, either the
        labour of the apostle, the pains he took, the hardships he endured, in
        ministering: the Gospel to them; or his agreeable life and conversation,
        which were a means of recommending the word, and of engaging an
        attention to it; or rather the miraculous works and mighty deeds which
        were wrought by the apostle, in confirmation of the doctrine he
        preached, as it seems to be explained in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#019">Rom 15:19</a>.

      </p>
      Through mighty signs and wonders,.... Or "in", or "through the power of
      signs and wonders", as the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions
      render the words. These carrying along with them evidence and conviction
      of the truth of what was delivered, wrought wonderfully and powerfully on
      the minds of the Gentiles to embrace the Gospel, and submit to the
      ordinances of it; though all would have been insufficient, had it not been
      for what follows,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by the power of the Spirit of God: the Alexandrian copy and one of
        Stephens's read, "by the power of the Holy Spirit", and so does the
        Vulgate Latin version; meaning, either that the mighty signs and wonders
        in healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, raising the dead,
        &amp;c. were performed not by the efficacy and working of Satan, as the
        signs and lying wonders of antichristian men, but by the Spirit of God,
        by whom Christ and all his apostles wrought the miracles they did; or
        that the ministration of the word in which the apostle laboured, was by
        the power of the Spirit of God; it was he that imparted all spiritual
        gifts to him, qualifying him for this service; it was he that assisted
        him in it, and enabled him to go through it; it was in demonstration of
        the Spirit and of power that he performed it; and that not in words
        which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth: or else
        that the obedience of the Gentiles to the faith of Christ, through the
        preaching of the Gospel, and the wonderful works that attended it as
        means, were purely owing to the power of the Spirit of God, as the
        efficient cause; it was not by might, or power of the preacher; nor
        merely by the power of signs and wonders; but by the powerful and
        efficacious grace of the Spirit of God, who took away the stony,
        stubborn, and disobedient heart, and gave them an heart of flesh, a
        tender, flexible, and obedient one; and caused them to walk in and
        observe the commandments and ordinances of the Lord:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully
        preached the Gospel of Christ; that which Christ, as God, is the author
        of; as man, was a preacher and minister of; and, as Mediator, is the
        subject matter of: this the apostle "preached fully" and completely,
        every part and branch of it, kept back nothing of it, but faithfully
        declared the whole; and so fulfilled it, as the word may be rendered,
        and his ministry; or he filled the Gospel, the net of the Gospel, which
        he spread in every place; or rather he diffused the knowledge of it
        everywhere; he filled all places with it wherever he came, even "from
        Jerusalem" round about unto Illyricum: not that he began to preach at
        Jerusalem, but at Damascus; from whence he went to Arabia, and after
        that to Jerusalem; but inasmuch as he was of Jerusalem, and had preached
        there, from whence the Gospel originally came, and this was the boundary
        of his ministry one way, he makes mention of it; as Illyricum was the
        boundary of it another way, which was on the extreme part of Macedonia:
        it is now called Sclavonia, and is an European nation; part of it is
        Dalmatia, mentioned
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010">Ti2 4:10</a>. Apollonia was in
        it, according to Mela (z), where the apostle is said to pass through (Act 17:1) it has on the
        south the gulf of Venice, on the north the Danube, on the west Germany,
        and on the east Thracia and Macedonia: according to Ptolomy (a),
        Illyris, or Illyricum, was bounded on the north with upper and lower
        Pannonia, now called Hungary and Austria; on the east with upper Mysia,
        now Servia; and on the south with part of Macedonia; it lies over
        against Italy, the Adriatic sea being between them; its length, from the
        river Drinus to Arsa, is reckoned about 480 miles, and its breadth, from
        the mountains of Croatia to the sea, is computed to be about 120: it is
        by some divided into Slavonia, Dalmatia, and Albania; Slavonia is the
        western part, Albania the eastern, and Dalmatia between them; according
        to others, it includes Slavonia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia; and had
        its name of Illyricum, from Illyrius, the son of Cadmus; or as others,
        from Illyrius, the son of Celta: here the Gospel was preached by the
        Apostle Paul, and no doubt with success; and churches were planted here,
        and which remained for several ages: in the "second" century there was a
        church in Illyricum, and Eleutherius was bishop, who is said to be a
        famous teacher; he was born at Rome, and his mother Anthia is reported
        to be converted by the Apostle Paul; in the same age lived one Quirinus,
        first a tribune, and then a bishop of Illyricum, who became a martyr
        under Trajan: in the "third" century there were churches in Illyricum,
        though devastations were made in it by the Goths; in the "fourth"
        century, frequent mention is made of the churches in Illyricum; and the
        bishops convened at Rome under Damascus in the times of Constantius
        wrote with great respect to the brethren in Illyricum; in Siscia, a city
        in this country, Quirinus a bishop suffered martyrdom; here a synod met
        against the Arians, and yet many in this country were infected with that
        heresy, by Valens and Ursatius; in this age Hilary, of Poictiers in
        France, spread the Gospel in this country; and he and Eusebius of
        Vercelli, in Piedmont, visited the churches, and corrected what was
        amiss: in the "fifth" century there was a church in Illyricum, and in
        Salo, a city of Dalmatia, Glycerius was bishop: in the "sixth" century
        there were also churches here, as appears from the letter of Symmachus
        to the bishops of them, and to their people; and in this age also
        Gregory wrote to all the bishops in Illyricum, to receive such bishops
        as were banished: in the "eighth" century, the bishops of Illyricum were
        in the Nycene synod, and Boniface gathered a church in Slavonia (b);
        thus far Christianity may be traced in this country: hither the apostle
        went, not in a direct line, but round about, and took many countries,
        cities, and towns in his way, as the history of his journeys and travels
        in the Acts of the Apostles shows, and as he here suggests.

      Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel,.... The sense is, not barely
      that he strove to preach the Gospel and not the law, the pure Gospel, and,
      not a mixed one; nor only that he endeavoured to preach it fully, and
      leave out nothing; but that he had an holy ambition to preach it,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not where Christ was named; as in Judea, where he had been for many ages
        spoken of and expected, and where he had lately appeared, lived,
        suffered, and died, and where his Gospel had been preached by all the
        apostles; as also in such parts of the Gentile world, where others of
        the apostles had been, and had made mention of his name, and published
        the glad tidings of salvation by him; but he chose rather to go to such
        Heathen nations, as were wholly without any knowledge of him; who had
        only the dim light of nature to guide them; had had no promises nor
        prophecies of the Messiah, nor so much as any hints, at least very
        distant ones, concerning him; and where as yet the sound of the Gospel
        bad not reached:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        lest I should build on another man's foundation; meaning not the law of
        Moses, nor the doctrines of the false teachers, but the foundation of
        the true apostles, and which was no other than the foundation Christ, he
        himself laid; but he chose not to go where they had laid the foundation
        by preaching Christ and his Gospel, that he might not take another man's
        crown, or boast in another man's line, or of other men's labours; but
        rather to go where others had never been, that he might first lay the
        foundation himself, by preaching Christ, and him crucified, and so the
        more act up to his character as an apostle, and as the apostle to the
        Gentiles.

      But as it is written,.... In
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015">Isa 52:15</a>;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to whom he was not spoken of, they shall see, and they that have not
        heard shall understand; for the Messiah was not spoken of to the
        Gentiles; they were strangers to the covenants of promise; the oracles
        of God were committed to the Jews; God gave his word and statutes to
        them, and not to any other nation: and yet, according to this prophecy,
        the Gentiles were to see him whom they had no account of; not in the
        flesh with their bodily eyes, in which sense only, or at least chiefly,
        the Jews saw him; but with the eyes of their understanding, by faith, as
        exhibited and evidently set forth before them as crucified, in the
        Gospel and the ordinances of it: and though they had heard nothing of
        him, having for many hundreds of years been left in ignorance, and
        suffered to walk in their own ways, until the apostles were sent among
        them; whose sound went into all the earth, and their words to the end of
        the world; yet when this would be the case, according to these words,
        they would understand the mind and will of God, the mysteries of his
        grace, the nature of the person and offices of Christ, the design of his
        coming into the world, and the way of salvation by him; all which was
        greatly brought about and accomplished, in the ministry of the Apostle
        Paul among them. The passage is very pertinently cited and applied by
        the apostle. The whole paragraph is to be understood of the Messiah,
        from whence it is taken, as it is owned, and accordingly interpreted by
        many Jewish writers, both ancient (b) and modern (c); and these words
        particularly respect the kings and nations of the world, who are
        represented as struck with silence and wonder, when, upon the preaching
        and hearing of the Messiah, they should see him by faith, and
        spiritually understand what is declared concerning him. The difference
        between the apostle's version of these words, which is the same with the
        Septuagint, and the text in Isaiah, is very inconsiderable. The first
        clause of the Hebrew text may be literally rendered thus, "for him, who
        was not spoken of to them, they shall see"; and the apostle's Greek in
        this manner, to whom "it was not spoken of concerning him, they shall
        see"; the sense is the same, and person intended Christ: the latter
        clause, which we from the Hebrew text render, "and that which they had
        not heard, shall they consider"; and here, "they that have not heard,
        shall understand", has nothing material in it, in which they differ; for
        in the former part of it both design the Messiah, and the things
        concerning him, the Gentiles had not heard of; and the latter is
        rendered and explained by the Targum, and by R. Sol Jarchi, as by the
        apostle, "they shall understand"; and which fitly expresses the sense of
        the Hebrew word used by the prophet.
