      Thou wilt say then unto me,.... That is, thou wilt object to me; for this
      is another objection of the adversary, against the doctrine the apostle
      was advancing: and it is an objection of a mere natural man, of one given
      up to a reprobate mind, of an insolent hardened sinner; it discovers the
      enmity of the carnal mind to God; if is one of the high things that exalts
      itself against the knowledge of him; it is with a witness a stretching out
      of the hand against God, and strengthening a man's self against the
      Almighty; it is a running upon him, even upon the thick bosses of his
      bucklers; it carries in it the marks of ill nature, surliness, and
      rudeness, to the last degree:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        why doth he yet find fault? The objector does not think fit to name the
        name of "God", or "the Lord", but calls him "he"; and a considerable
        emphasis lies upon the word "yet": what as if he should say, is he not
        content with the injustice he has already exercised, in passing by some,
        when he chose others; in leaving them to themselves, and hardening their
        hearts against him, and to go on in their own ways, which must
        unavoidably end in destruction; but after all this, is angry with them,
        finds fault with them, blames, accuses, and condemns them, for that
        which they cannot help; nay, for that which he himself wills? this is
        downright cruelty and tyranny. The objector seems to have a particular
        regard to the case of Pharaoh, the apostle had instanced in, when after
        God had declared that he had raised him up for this very purpose, to
        make known his power, and show forth his glory in all the world, still
        finds fault with him and says, "as yet exaltest thou thyself against my
        people, that thou wilt not let them go?"
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#017">Exo 9:17</a>; and yet he
        himself had hardened his heart, and continued to harden his heart, that
        he might not let them go as yet; and when he had let them go, hardened
        his heart again to pursue after them, when he drowned him and his host
        in the Red sea; all which in this objection, is represented as
        unparalleled cruelty and unmercifulness; though it is not restrained to
        this particular case, but is designed to be applied to all other
        hardened persons; and to expose the unreasonableness of the divine
        proceedings, in hardening men at his pleasure; and then blaming them for
        acting as hardened ones, when he himself has made them so, and wills
        they should act in this manner:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for who hath resisted his will? This is said in support of the former,
        and means not God's will of command, which is always resisted more or
        less, by wicked men and devils; but his will of purpose, his counsels
        and decrees, which stand firm and sure, and can never be resisted, so as
        to be frustrated and made void. This the objector takes up, and improves
        against God; that since he hardens whom he will, and there is no
        resisting his will, the fault then can never lie in them who are
        hardened, and who act as such, but in God; and therefore it must be
        unreasonable in him to be angry with, blame, accuse, and condemn persons
        for being and doing that, which he himself wills them to be and do. Let
        the disputers of this world, the reasoners of the present age, come and
        see their own faces, and read the whole strength of their objections, in
        this wicked man's; and from whence we may be assured, that since the
        objections are the same, the doctrine must be the same that is objected
        to: and this we gain however by it, that the doctrines of particular and
        personal election and reprobation, were the doctrines of the apostle;
        since against no other, with any face, or under any pretence, could such
        an objection be formed: next follows the apostle's answer.

      Nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against God?.... Or "answerest
      again to God": some have been so weak and wicked as to suggest, that the
      apostle met with an objection he could not answer, or give a fair solution
      of, and therefore takes the method he does: but when the several things
      returned in answer by the apostle are considered, it will appear that he
      has taken the wisest method to silence such an audacious objector, and
      that he abundantly clears God from the charge of cruelty and
      unmercifulness. And he answers "first", by putting the insolent creature
      in mind of what he was; "nay, but O man, who art thou?" &amp;c. Thou art
      man, and not God; a creature, and not the Creator; and must not expect
      that he, thy Creator, will give an account of his matters to thee, or a
      reason why he does, this or the other thing. Thou art but a man, who in
      his best estate was vanity, being mutable; thou art a fallen sinful
      creature, and obnoxious to the wrath and displeasure of God for thy sins,
      and darest thou to open thy mouth against him? thou art a poor, foolish,
      and ignorant man, born like a wild ass's colt, without understanding, and
      wilt thou take upon thee to confront, direct, or counsel the Most High, or
      tell him what is fitting to be done, or not done? "next" the apostle
      answers, by pointing out his folly and madness, in replying to God. To
      speak to God in behalf of a man's self at the throne of grace, in the most
      submissive manner, for any mercy or favour wanted, is an high privilege,
      and it is a wonderful condescension in God to admit of; and when a man, a
      good man takes upon him to plead with God on the behalf of others, of a
      wicked people, a sinful nation, he ought to set before him the example and
      conduct of Abraham, who in a like case acknowledged himself to be but dust
      and ashes, and more than once entreated, that the Lord would not be angry
      at his importunity; but for a man to answer again to God, which a servant
      ought not to do to his master, to litigate a point with God, to dispute a
      matter with him, is the highest instance of arrogance and impudence: "woe
      unto him that striveth with his Maker, let the potsherd strive with the
      potsherds of the earth",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009">Isa 45:9</a>, with their equals,
      with men like themselves, but let no man dare to "contend with God"; if he
      should, "he cannot answer him one of a thousand",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#003">Job 9:3</a>; for "he is wise in
      heart", in forming all his counsels, purposes, and decrees; "and mighty in
      strength", to execute them; "who hath hardened himself against him and
      hath prospered?" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#004">Job 9:4</a>.
      Another way the apostle takes in answering the objection is, by showing
      the absurdity of a creature's wrangling with God about his make, and the
      circumstances in which he is made:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall the thing formed, say unto him that formed it, why hast thou made
        me thus? reference is had to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009">Isa 45:9</a>; Now as it would
        be a most absurd thing for the clay, was it capable of speaking, to say
        to the fashioner of it, why dost thou put me into such or such a shape
        and form? or for any piece of workmanship to say to the maker of it, he
        has no hands, no head, no judgment and skill; or for a child to say to
        its parents, what begettest thou, or what hast thou brought forth? so
        absurd and unreasonable is it, for any to say to God, why hast thou
        appointed me to such and such ends and purposes, and has brought me into
        being in such a manner, and under such circumstances? There is a story
        in the Talmud (n), which may be pertinently produced here;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "it happened to R. Eleazar ben Simeon, of Migdal Gedur, that he went
        from his master's house, and he was riding on an ass, and travelling by
        the sea side, and as he rejoiced exceedingly, and his heart was lifted
        up because he had learnt much of the law, there was joined to him a
        certain man that was very much deformed, and says to him, peace be upon
        thee Rabbi; but he did not return the salutation to him, but says to him
        "Raca", how deformed is that man! perhaps all thy townsmen are as
        deformed as thee; he replied to him, I do not know, but go and say, ,
        "to the workman that made me", how ugly is this vessel thou hast made,
        when he knew in himself that he has sinned; upon this the Rabbi
        dismounted his ass, and fell down before him, and said unto him, I
        entreat of thee forgive me; he said unto him, I cannot forgive thee,
        till thou goest "to the workman that made me", and say, how ugly is this
        vessel which thou hast made.''

      Hath not the potter power over the clay,.... By the power the potter has
      over the clay, to shape it in what form he pleases, and out of it to make
      what vessels he pleases, and for what purposes he thinks fit, which will
      be most to his own advantage, the apostle expresses the sovereign and
      unlimited powder which God has over his creatures; the passages referred
      to, are
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#008">Isa 64:8</a>, in which God is
      represented as the potter, and men as clay in his hands; now if the potter
      has such power over the clay which he did not make, only has made a
      purchase of, or has it in his possession, much more has God a power, who
      has created the clay, to appoint out of it persons to different uses and
      purposes, for his own glory, as he sees fit; even
      <p></p>
      <p>
        of the same lump, to make one vessel to honour, and another to
        dishonour. The apostle seems to design hereby, to point out to us the
        object of predestination to be man, as yet not made, but as lying in the
        mere mass of creatureship, signified by the unformed clay, before put
        into any shape; and is an allusion to the first creation of man, out of
        the clay, or dust of the earth,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007">Gen 2:7</a>; for such a
        consideration of man best agrees with the clay, lump, or mass, not yet
        formed, than as already made, and much less as fallen and corrupted: for
        if men, in predestination, were considered in the corrupt mass, or as
        fallen creatures, they could not be so well said to be made out of it,
        both to honour and dishonour; but rather since they were all
        dishonourable, that some were left in that dishonour, and others removed
        from it unto honour: besides, if this is not the case, God must create
        man without an end, which is contrary to the principle of reason and
        wisdom; the end is the cause, for which a thing is what it is; and it is
        a known rule, that what is first in intention, is last in execution, and
        "vice versa": the end is first fixed, and then the means; for God to
        create man, and then to fix the end of his creation, is to do what no
        wise potter would do, first make his pots, and then think of the end of
        making them, and the use they are to be put unto. To make one vessel to
        honour, and another to dishonour, is for God to appoint creatures, which
        are to be made out of the same mass and lump, for his own glory; which
        end, his own glory, he determines to bring about by different means, as
        these following: with respect to the vessels of honour, whom he appoints
        for his glory, he determines to create them; to suffer them to fall into
        sin, whereby they become polluted and guilty; to raise and recover them,
        by the obedience, sufferings, and death of his Son; to regenerate,
        renew, and sanctify them, by his Spirit and grace, and to bring them to
        eternal happiness; and hereby compass the aforesaid end, his own glory,
        the glorifying of his grace and mercy, in a way consistent with justice
        and holiness: with respect to the vessels of dishonour, whom he also
        appoints for the glorifying of himself, he determines to create them out
        of the same lump; to suffer them to fall into sin; to leave them in
        their sins, in the pollution and guilt of them, and to condemn them for
        them; and hereby gain his ultimate end, his own glory, glorifying the
        perfections of his power, justice, and holiness, without the least
        blemish to his goodness and mercy: now if a potter has power, for his
        own advantage and secular interest, to make out of the same clay what
        vessels he pleases; much more has God a power, out of the same mass and
        lump of creatureship, to appoint creatures he determines to make to his
        own glory; which he brings about by different methods, consistent with
        the perfections of his nature.

      What if God, willing to show his wrath,.... The apostle proceeds to clear
      God from any charge of cruelty and unmercifulness, by observing his
      conduct in time, both towards those he passes by, and towards those he
      chooses; for in this and the following verse, nothing is said relating to
      any act of God before time, everything of that kind being considered
      already. In this verse, the apostle considers the conduct of God towards
      the vessels of dishonour; and let it be observed, that these are called
      <p></p>
      <p>
        vessels of wrath fitted for destruction; they are said to be vessels,
        and so no longer considered in the clay, in the mass and heap of
        creatureship, but as creatures formed and made, and brought into being;
        and so to be used as instruments in God's hands, to subserve his ends
        and purposes, and therefore called "vessels"; and not only so, but
        "vessels of wrath", fallen sinful creatures, and so deserving of the
        wrath of God, and objects of his vindictive justice, in whom he may
        righteously display his wrath and vengeance: hence they may be so
        called, being as vessels filled with his wrath; as such who are the
        instruments and executioners of his wrath are called, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005">Isa 13:5</a>, , "vessels of
        his wrath"; and in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#025">Jer 50:25</a>; where the
        Septuagint use the same phrase as here: and they are moreover said to be
        "fitted for destruction", as Haman is said to be by the Jews (o); whom
        they affirm to be the same with Memucan, and ask why is his name called
        Memucan? and answer, , "because he was fitted for punishment": so these
        are said to be "fitted for destruction", that is, eternal damnation; not
        by God, for this does not respect God's act of ordination to punishment;
        but by Satan, the god of this world, that blinds them, who works
        effectually in them, and leads them captive at his will; and by
        themselves, by their own wickedness, hardness of heart, and impenitence,
        do they treasure up to themselves wrath, against the day of wrath, so
        that their destruction is of themselves: a phrase somewhat like this is
        used in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#012">Psa 31:12</a>, where
        the Psalmist, under some dismal apprehensions of himself, says, that he
        was like , "a perishing vessel", or "a vessel of perdition"; the
        Septuagint render it, , "a lost vessel". Now what is the method of the
        divine conduct towards such persons? he
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        endures them with much longsuffering; as he did the old world, before he
        destroyed it; and as he did Pharaoh, before he cut him off: God not only
        supports such persons in their beings, amidst all their impieties and
        iniquities, but follows and fills them with his providential goodness,
        insomuch that many of them have more than heart can wish; nay, to many
        he affords the outward means of grace, which they slight and despise;
        externally calls them, but they refuse, loving darkness rather than
        light, and therefore are inexcusable: now if after all this patience,
        indulgence, and forbearance, when he could in justice have sent them to
        hell long ago, he is "willing to show his wrath"; his displicency at sin
        and sinners, his vindictive justice, his righteous vengeance:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and to make his power known; what it is he can do, by the utter
        destruction and damnation of such persons; what man in his senses can
        ever find fault with such a procedure, or charge it with tyranny,
        cruelty, and unmercifulness?

      And that he might make known the riches of his glory,.... That is, his
      glorious riches, the perfections of his nature, his love, grace, and
      mercy, his wisdom, power, faithfulness, justice, and holiness; all which
      are most evidently displayed in the salvation of his people, here called
      <p></p>
      <p>
        vessels of mercy, which he hath afore prepared unto glory. They are said
        to be vessels, and so considered as creatures, made and brought into
        being; "vessels of mercy", and so fallen creatures, and by sin become
        miserable, for only such are objects of mercy: they are not called so,
        because deserving of mercy more than others, they are in no wise better
        than others, and are by nature children of wrath, even as others; but
        because God of his infinite goodness fills them with his mercy, displays
        it in them, in the redemption of them by his Son, in the regeneration of
        them by his Spirit, and in their eternal salvation: and these are by him
        "afore prepared unto glory"; to everlasting happiness, which he has
        chosen them to before time, and calls them to in time; to this glory he
        does not take them, until he has prepared them for it; which act of
        preparation does not regard the eternal predestination of them to
        eternal life, but an act of his grace towards them in time; and which
        lies in putting upon them the righteousness of his Son, and in putting
        his grace in them; or in other words, in justifying them by the
        imputation and application of the righteousness of his Son unto them,
        and by the regeneration, renovation, and sanctification of their hearts,
        by his Spirit. Now what if God willing to make known his glorious
        perfections, by displaying his mercy to such sinners, and by preparing
        them for heaven in a way consistent with his holiness and justice, what
        can any man that has the exercise of his reason object to this? The
        whole of his conduct is free from blame and censure; the vessels of
        wrath he shows his wrath upon, are such as fit themselves for
        destruction, and whom he endures with much longsuffering and patience,
        and therefore he cannot be chargeable with cruelty; the vessels of mercy
        he brings to glory, none of them are taken thither, until they are
        prepared for it, in a way of righteousness and holiness, and therefore
        he cannot be charged with acting contrary to the perfections of his
        nature.

      Even us whom he hath called,.... From election the apostle proceeds to
      calling, the fruit and evidence of it, taking the same method he did in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030">Rom 8:30</a>, with a view to
      treat of the call of the Gentiles, of which he afterwards gives proof from
      prophecy; whence it appears to be according to divine predestination, upon
      which prophecy is founded; for God foretells that such a thing will be,
      because he has foreordained it shall be. These words are explanative of
      the former, and show who the vessels of mercy are; they are such whom God
      calls by his grace. Election may be known by calling, as the cause by its
      effect, and that without an extraordinary revelation. This may as well be
      known, as man's adoption, justification, and the forgiveness of his sins;
      for as all the chosen are, and shall be called in time, so all that are
      truly called by the grace of God, are manifestly, and to a demonstration,
      the chosen vessels of salvation: if a man is satisfied of his calling, he
      ought to be equally so of his election, the one being demonstrable by the
      other; and for such an one to doubt of it, is his sin and crime. Moreover,
      the above phrase, "afore prepared for glory", is here further explained;
      to be afore prepared for glory, is no other than to be called, sanctified,
      and justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
      God; for this is the saints' preparation for glory, before they come to
      it; and hereby the means are expressed, even sanctification of the Spirit,
      and belief of the truth, through which God appoints his people unto
      salvation: now this calling is to be understood, not of a call to any
      office, as of Aaron to the priesthood, of Saul to the kingdom, of the
      disciples of Christ to apostleship, or of ministers to the work of the
      ministry; for persons may be called to the highest office in church and
      state, as Judas to: apostleship, and Pharaoh to the throne of Egypt, and
      yet have no share in electing grace: nor of a call by the external
      ministry of the word, which is often slighted, despised, and of none
      effect; in this sense many are called, who are not chosen: but of a call
      that is by the powerful, efficacious, and irresistible grace of God; a
      call that is internal, that reaches the heart, and not the ear only: a
      special one that is peculiar to God's elect, is by special grace, and is
      to special blessings, as both grace and glory; it is an high, heavenly,
      and holy calling, and is without repentance; between which and
      glorification, as between it and eternal election, there is a close and an
      inseparable connection. The objects of this grace follow,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles; not all the Jews, nor
        all the Gentiles, but some of each; as all are not chosen, all are not
        redeemed, only some out of every kindred, tongue, nation, and people; so
        not all, but some only are called by grace: and this is not peculiar to
        the Jews, it reaches to the Gentiles also; and under the present
        dispensation, to the far greater number of them.

      As he also saith in Osee,....
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Hos 2:23</a>, so "Hosea" is
      called "Osee", as here, in the Septuagint in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh010.htm#023">Neh 10:23</a>. That is, as God
      says in the prophecy of Hosea, which was given by divine inspiration; and
      speaks of the calling of the Gentiles, as the spiritual Israel, after God
      had wrote a "lo-ammi",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009">Hos 1:9</a>, and a "loruhamah",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#006">Hos 1:6</a>, upon the people of
      the Jews; and shows, that he had appointed some from among the Gentiles,
      to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ; since he foretells their calling,
      long before they were in being; which could have no other foundation than
      his own eternal sovereign will and pleasure:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I will call them my people, which were not my people; his people they
        were before he called them, in some sense; inasmuch as he had chosen
        them for his people, had promised in covenant they should be, had given
        them to Christ as his people, and him to be a covenant to them: who, as
        such, made reconciliation for them, sanctified them by his blood,
        redeemed and saved them; but then they were not known to be the people
        of God, neither by themselves, who knew not God, and so could not know
        themselves to be his people; nor by others, by the Jews, by whom they
        were called the uncircumcision, sinners of the Gentiles; looking upon
        the character or the people of God, as only belonging to themselves: God
        had not as yet laid hold on them as his people, and claimed his right in
        them, and made known himself to them as their covenant God; he had not
        avouched them to be his people, nor had they avouched him to be their
        God; as yet they were not his willing people, nor a holy people, not
        being formed for himself, by his mighty grace; nor a people near unto
        him, with respect to worship and fellowship, but afar off from him. His
        calling them his people, is his acquainting them with their relation to
        him, which he had taken them in to himself, of his own grace; for so it
        is in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Hos 2:23</a>, "And I
        will say unto them which were not my people, thou art my people": in the
        effectual calling, the Spirit of God is sent down into the hearts of his
        people, to witness their relation to him, and to work faith in their
        souls, to receive the testimony; when they reply and say, "thou art my
        God", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Hos 2:23</a>, and so
        they come to know themselves to be the people of God, of which they were
        before ignorant; and to be known others, by being made a willing people,
        in the day God's power upon them, willing to be saved by him in his own
        way, and willing to serve and worship him in his own ordinances, and
        according to his own appointment; and by being holy and righteous,
        having the characters, and enjoying the privileges of the people of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and her beloved, which was not beloved. In the text in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Hos 2:23</a>, it is, "I will
        have mercy on her that had not obtained mercy": hence the Vulgate Latin
        has added this clause to the text, though unsupported by any copy, or
        other version. The apostle is to be justified in his version, by the
        Septuagint interpreters, who have rendered the passage in Hosea, "I will
        love her that was not beloved"; and by the true sense of the word there
        used, which signifies to love in the most kind, tender, and endearing
        manner; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#001">Psa 18:1</a>;
        where the word is used and so rendered. The sense is not, that God's
        chosen ones among the Gentiles were not the objects of his love before
        calling; for their very calling is the fruit, effect, and so the
        evidence of love before. The love of God is from everlasting to
        everlasting, invariably and unchangeably the same; he had chosen them in
        his Son; he had made a covenant with them in Christ, had put them into
        his hands, and made them his care and charge; he had sent him to die for
        them, and obtain eternal redemption for them; and all this before he
        called them, which abundantly proves his love to them: but this love was
        not manifested to their souls; it had not been shed abroad in their
        hearts; they had no sensation of it in their breasts; the streams of
        that river of God had not as yet flowed into their souls; nor were they
        partakers of the effects of it in themselves; but being called by grace,
        they feel, they experience, and enjoy that, and all the happy: fruits
        and effects of it; the loving kindness of God is let down into their
        hearts in the effectual calling, and with it he draws them to himself,
        as a fruit and evidence of his everlasting and unchangeable love to
        them.

      And it shall come to pass that in the place,.... This is another citation
      out of Hosea, and is to be seen in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010">Hos 1:10</a>, and the meaning
      is, that in those countries, as here in Great Britain, in the very
      selfsame place, or spot of ground,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        where it was said unto them, ye are not my people; where were nothing
        but idolatry and idolatrous worshippers, and whose worship, works, and
        actions, declared them not to be the people of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        there shall they be called the children of the living God; not only
        children of God, but of the living God; in opposition to their idol
        gods, their lifeless deities, and senseless statues of gold, silver,
        brass, wood, or stone, they fell down to and worshipped. The chosen of
        God among the Gentiles, were from all eternity predestinated to the
        adoption of children; this blessing was provided, laid up, and secured
        for them, in the covenant of grace; in this relation of children were
        they given to Christ, and under this consideration of them did he
        partake of the same flesh and blood with them, and died, to gather them
        together, who were scattered abroad in the several parts of the world;
        and because they were antecedently sons by adopting grace, therefore the
        Spirit of God in effectual calling is sent down into their hearts to
        bear witness to their spirits, that they are the children of the living
        God, and to work faith in their souls to believe it; by which grace they
        receive this blessing, as all others, even the right and privilege of
        being the children of God; by this they claim it, and enjoy the comfort
        of it; and so are manifestly, both to themselves and others, the
        children of God by faith in Christ Jesus; though this will more clearly
        appear another day, than it does now.

      Esaias crieth concerning Israel,.... The apostle having produced proper
      testimonies in proof of the calling of the Gentiles, proceeds to mention
      others; showing, that some few of the Jews also were to be called,
      according to prophecy, founded upon divine predestination; which, though
      they are full proofs of the calling of some from among the Jews, yet at
      the same time suggest the casting off of the far greater number of them;
      and which is the apostle's view in citing them, as appears from what he
      says both here and in the two following chapters. The first testimony is
      taken out of
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022">Isa 10:22</a>, and is prefaced
      or introduced with these words; which either express the great concern of
      mind and sorrow of heart, with which the prophet spoke them, even with
      strong crying and tears, seeing a remnant of them only was to be saved; or
      they show his heart's desire and prayer to God, "for Israel", as the words
      may be rendered, how that he cried to the Lord for them, entreated him
      with earnestness and importunity, and wrestled with him on their behalf;
      or they declare the presence of mind, the freedom of expression, the
      boldness and intrepidity with which he delivered this message to the Jews,
      which he knew must be ungrateful to them; in doing which, he run the risk
      of losing his interest in their affections, if not his life; and inasmuch
      very probably they did not choose to hear it, but turned away from him, he
      cried aloud, he spared not, he lift up his voice like a trumpet, as he is
      bid to do elsewhere, resolving they should hear what he had to say, from
      the Lord of hosts. This is a form of speech used by the Jews, in citing
      Scripture; thus, , "the prophet cries" (p), namely, in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#001">Isa 26:1</a>, which is spoken of
      the same prophet as here; and again (q) the Holy Spirit "cries, and says",
      in some certain passage of Scripture; and in another place (r) the Holy
      Spirit "cried", saying, as in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe003.htm#003">Joe 3:3</a>, "they have cast
      lots for my people".
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea:
        this part of the testimony seems rather to be taken from
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010">Hos 1:10</a>, which may easily
        be accounted for; since the apostle had just cited the words in Hosea,
        and so carrying them in his mind, transcribes this sentence from thence;
        it perfectly agreeing in sense with the passage in Isaiah he had in
        view, where it stands thus, "though thy people Israel be as the sand of
        the sea", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022">Isa 10:22</a>; that
        is, though the number of them be such as to be compared thereunto;
        though they are many as the sand of the sea, as the Targum, Kimchi, and
        Aben Ezra explain it. This was promised unto Abraham, and had its
        accomplishment in the days of Solomon, and in after times; they were for
        quantity, for number, as the sand of the sea, even innumerable; and for
        quality, being barren and unfruitful, a people laden with iniquity, a
        seed of evildoers:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a remnant shall be saved; that is, a few persons only; , "few are called
        a remnant", as Kimchi on the place observes; these are the remnant among
        the Jews, according to the election of grace; the few that were chosen,
        though many were called by the external ministry of Christ and his
        apostles; the little city, and few men in it, even the escaped of
        Israel, he that was left in Zion, and that remained in Jerusalem; the
        little flock among them, which were as sheep among wolves; the few that
        entered in at the strait gate, and found the way to eternal life; the
        few that shall be saved; and these shall certainly be saved, with a
        spiritual and eternal salvation. These, according to the prophecy, were
        to return to the mighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised
        Messiah; be converted to him, and so saved by him with an everlasting
        salvation: God had resolved upon it, whose counsel shall stand; he had
        promised it in covenant, which is ordered in all things and sure; he
        sent his Son to save these his people from their sins, who is become the
        author of eternal salvation to them; the grace of God is efficacious and
        powerful enough, to make them willing to be saved by Christ, and to
        bring them to him, to venture upon him, and commit their souls to him,
        to be saved by him; and almighty power is concerned, to keep them
        through faith unto salvation: so that this little remnant, through the
        Father's everlasting and unchangeable love, the Son's purchase, prayers,
        and preparations, and the spirits grace, which works them up for this
        selfsame thing, shall be certainly and completely saved; though with
        respect to the difficulties attending it, which could have been
        surmounted by none but Christ, and by reason of their discouragements
        arising from sin, temptations, and persecutions, they may be said to be
        scarcely saved.

      For he will finish the work,.... This passage has some difficulty in it:
      some, instead of "work", read "account", and suppose it is an allusion to
      the balancing of accounts, when the remainder is cut off, which commonly
      is but little; and so regards the small number of the Jews that shall be
      called and saved, as before: others read it "the word", and differently
      explain it; some understanding it of the incarnate Word, of his being
      emptied, and made of no reputation, of his being cut off in a very short
      time, a few years after he had entered upon his public ministry, and of
      the few persons converted under it; others of the law, of the cutting off,
      or abolishing the ceremonial law, perfecting or completing the moral law,
      and abbreviating it, or reducing it into a short compendium; others of the
      Gospel, bringing in and revealing a perfect righteousness, for the
      justification of sinners, which the law could not do; all foreign to the
      apostle's purpose. Those who think God's work, his strange work is meant,
      his work of punitive justice he will finish,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and cut it short in righteousness, because a short work will the Lord
        make upon the earth, when he cut off and destroyed the greater part of
        the people of the Jews, and saved a remnant, seem to come nearer the
        mind of the prophet and the apostle's design, in citing this passage.
        The words as in Isaiah, I would choose to render and explain thus; ,
        "the absolute", or "precise degree", so Aben Ezra, interprets it, ,
        "that which is decreed by God", the decree concerning the salvation of
        the remnant, , "he", i.e. God "shall cause to overflow in
        righteousness",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022">Isa 10:22</a>, as an
        overflowing river; that is, he shall abundantly execute it, he shall
        completely fulfil it, to finish and cut it short in the most righteous
        manner, consistent with all his divine perfections; , "for the decree
        and that determined", so Aben Ezra, , "the decree decreed" by God, "the
        Lord God of hosts", "shall execute", accomplish, make short and full
        work of it, "in the midst of all the land",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#023">Isa 10:23</a>, that is, of
        Judea: so that the words contain a most strong and invincible reason,
        why the remnant shall be saved; because God has made an absolute decree,
        concerning the salvation of it, which he will accomplish in the fullest
        manner, agreeably to his justice and holiness: the or "word", the
        apostle from the prophet speaks of, that should be finished, and cut
        short and accomplished in righteousness, is the sentence, counsel, or
        decree, conceived in the divine mind, concerning this matter: hence as
        the decree of election stands firm and sure, not upon the works of men,
        but upon the absolute, sovereign, and efficacious will of God; so the
        salvation of his chosen people is not precarious, but a most sure and
        certain thing.

      And as Esaias said before,.... In the beginning of his prophecy, in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009">Isa 1:9</a>.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Except the Lord of sabaoth had left us a seed; the title and character
        the great God goes by here, is "Lord of sabaoth", that is, "of hosts",
        or "armies"; the Septuagint often leave the word untranslated, as here
        and elsewhere, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011">Sa1 1:11</a>. He is Lord of
        the hosts of heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, whom he brings forth by
        number, calls by their names, and them to praise him; of the angels, the
        multitude of the heavenly host, that do his pleasure, fight under him,
        and for him; and of the hosts of nations, of the several kingdoms of the
        world, who are all under his government, and among whom he acts
        according to his sovereign will and pleasure. Kimchi on the place says,
        he is called so,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "because of "the hosts above", and because of "the hosts below", who are
        the Israelites, that are called "hosts"; wherefore he would not consume
        us all, as we deserved:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        no, according to the council of his own will, he left them "a seed"; or
        as it is in Isaiah, a very small remnant": and so the Syriac here, a
        remnant"; both signify one and the same, namely, a few persons only: "a
        remnant" signifies a few, which remain out of a large number; and so
        does "seed", which is reserved for sowing again, after the whole stock
        is sold off, or consumed: and the leaving of this small number designs
        God's gracious acts of reserving in the election of a people for
        himself; the calling them by his grace in time, and preserving them from
        general corruption; which if he had not done among the Jews, as Jarchi
        on the text says,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"of himself, and by his mercies, and not for our righteousnesses,''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha; the cities
        which God destroyed with fire and brimstone from heaven, for their
        iniquities: had it not been for electing grace, they would have been
        like the inhabitants of these cities for wickedness; and the case would
        have been the same with us and with the whole world, had it not been for
        God's act of election, choosing some to holiness here, and happiness
        hereafter. The decree of election is so far from being a door to
        licentiousness, that it is the true spring and source of all real
        holiness, that has been, or is in the world; and had it not been for
        this, there would have been no such thing as holiness in the world; and
        consequently not only Judea, but thee whole world, were it not for this,
        must have been long before now, like Sodom and Gomorrah, in their
        punishment.
