      For as many as have sinned without law,.... This is an instance of the
      strict justice of God, and proves him to be no respecter of persons; for
      the Gentiles, who were "without law", the written law of Moses, not
      without the law of nature in their breasts, nor without some civil laws
      and statutes of their own; inasmuch as they "sinned" against the God of
      nature, and the law and light of nature, they
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall also perish without law: not that their condemnation and perdition
        will be illegal, or not in due course of law; but it will not proceed
        upon, or according to the law of Moses, they never had; and much less
        for not believing in Christ, of whom they never heard; but their
        perdition will be for their sins committed without the law of Moses,
        against the law of nature: their not having the written law of Moses
        will be no plea in their favour, or be a reason why they should not be
        condemned; their persons will not be regarded as with or without the
        law, but their sins committed by them, to which facts their consciences
        will bear witness:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and, so on the other hand,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as many as have sinned in the law; who have been in and under the law of
        Moses, and have sinned against it, meaning the Jews:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall be judged by the law; and condemned by it, as they were in this
        world, and will be hereafter: their having this law will be no bar
        against their condemnation, but rather an aggravation of it; their
        hearing of it will be no plea in their favour; nor their doing of it
        neither, unless they could have done it to perfection; for perfect
        obedience it requires, as a justifying righteousness, otherwise it
        curses, condemns, and adjudges to death.

      For not the hearers of the law are just before God,.... The apostle here
      shows, that the Jews were justly condemned, notwithstanding their having
      and hearing of the law; since hearing without doing it, will never
      denominate persons righteous in the sight of God, however it might
      recommend them in the sight of men: regard seems to be had either to the
      first delivery of the law by Moses to the people of Israel, when he read
      it to them, and they hearkened to it, and promised obedience; or rather to
      the reading and hearing it every sabbath day; and may include a
      speculative knowledge of it, without a practical obedience to it; and
      which therefore must fall greatly short of entitling them to a justifying
      righteousness; since not these,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but the doers of the law, shall be justified; by whom are meant, not
        such who merely literally and externally fulfil the law, as they
        imagine; for the law is spiritual, and regards the inward as well as the
        outward man, and requires internal holiness, as well as external
        obedience; and the apostle is speaking of justification before God, who
        sees the heart, and not before men, who judge according to outward
        appearance: nor are such designed who are imperfect doers of the law;
        for the law requires a perfect obedience, and what is not perfect is not
        properly righteousness; nor does it, nor can it consider an imperfect
        righteousness as a perfect one; for it accuses of, pronounces guilty,
        curses, and condemns for every transgression of it. But such only can be
        intended, who are doers of it spiritually, internally, as well as
        externally, and that perfectly. Adam, in his state of innocence, was a
        perfect doer of the law; he sinning, and all his posterity in him, none
        of them are righteous, but all pass under a sentence of condemnation.
        The best of men, even believers in Christ, are not without sin in
        themselves; and when any of the saints are said to be perfect, it must
        be understood in a comparative sense, or as they are considered in
        Christ. There never was but one since Adam, and that is Christ, who has
        fulfilled, or could perfectly fulfil the law; the thing is impossible
        and impracticable for fallen man: hence these words must be understood
        either hypothetically, thus, not the hearers of the law, but if there
        were any perfect doers of it, they would be justified before God; or
        else of such persons who are considered in Christ, by whom the whole
        perfect righteousness of the law is fulfilled in them, and who may be
        reckoned as perfect doers of it in him, their substitute, surety, and
        representative.

      For when the Gentiles which have not the law,.... The objection of the
      Gentiles against their condemnation, taken from their being without the
      law, is here obviated. The apostle owns that they had not the law, that
      is, the written law of Moses, and yet intimates that they had, and must
      have a law, against which they sinned, and so deserved punishment, and
      which they in part obeyed; for these men
      <p></p>
      <p>
        do by nature the things contained in the law. The matter and substance
        of the moral law of Moses agrees with the law and light of nature; and
        the Gentiles in some measure, and in some sort, did these things by
        nature; not that men by the mere strength of nature without the grace of
        God, can fulfil the law, or do anything that is acceptable to God; and
        indeed, what these men did was merely natural and carnal, and so
        unacceptable to God. Some understand this of nature assisted by grace,
        in converted Gentiles, whether before or after the coming of Christ;
        others expound the phrase, by nature, freely, willingly, in opposition
        to the servile spirit of the Jews, in their obedience to the law; though
        it rather seems to design the dictates of natural reason, by which they
        acted: and so
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>these having not the law, the written law,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        are a law to themselves; which they have by nature and use, and which
        natural reason dictates to them. So Plato distinguishes the law
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "into written and un written (q): the written law is that which was used
        in commonwealths; and that "which was according to custom or nature",
        was called unwritten, such as not to go to market naked, nor to be
        clothed with women's clothes; which things were not forbidden by any
        law, but these were not done because forbidden by the unwritten law;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which he calls "unwritten", because not written on tables, or with ink;
        otherwise it was written in their minds, and which by nature and use
        they were accustomed to.
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      Which show the work of the law written in their hearts,.... Though the
      Gentiles had not the law in form, written on tables, or in a book, yet
      they had "the work", the matter, the sum and substance of it in their
      minds; as appears by the practices of many of them, in their external
      conversation. The moral law, in its purity and perfection, was written on
      the heart of Adam in his first creation; was sadly obliterated by his sin
      and fall; upon several accounts, and to answer various purposes, a system
      of laws was written on tables of stone for the use of the Israelites; and
      in regeneration the law is reinscribed on the hearts of God's people; and
      even among the Gentiles, and in their hearts, there are some remains of
      the old law and light of nature, which as by their outward conduct
      appears, so by the inward motions of their minds,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        their conscience also bearing witness; for, as the Jews say (r) , "the
        soul of a man witnesses in him"; for, or against him:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another;
        and this the Heathens themselves acknowledge, when they (s) speak of
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "tameion dikasthrion kai krithrion thv suneidhsewv, "the conclave,
        tribunal and judgment of conscience"; and which they call , "the most
        righteous judge": whose judgment reason receives, and gives its suffrage
        to, whether worthy of approbation or reproof; when it reads in the
        memory as if written on a table the things that are done, and then
        beholding the law as an exemplar, pronounces itself either worthy of
        honour or dishonour.''

      In the day when God shall judge,.... These words are to be read in
      connection with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013">Rom 2:13</a>,
      and express the time when both Jews and Gentiles will be judged, called a
      "day", both because of the clearness and evidence of the judgment that
      will be made, and because a certain time is fixed, though not known, which
      will surely come; also the matter of the judgment, which will be,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the secrets of men: whether good or bad, which are only known to God and
        themselves, and which may have been done ignorantly by them; "for God
        shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing, whether it
        be good, or whether it be evil",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#014">Ecc 12:14</a>, which is so
        interpreted by the Jews (t),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "when R. Jochanan came to that Scripture, he wept; "for God shall bring
        every work into judgment with every secret thing";''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        upon which the gloss says, yea, for those things which are hidden from
        him, which he has committed through ignorance, will he bring him into
        judgment; everything, even the least thing in a literal sense, but not
        for such silly trifling things they mention in the same place; doubtless
        the Holy Ghost means the secrets of men's hearts and actions, and the
        hidden things of darkness which are contrary to the holy law of God. The
        person by whom this awful judgment will be carried on is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ; to whom all judgment is committed, who is ordained Judge
        of quick and dead, and is every way fit for that office, being God as
        well as man, and so both omniscient and omnipotent: and this the apostle
        says will be,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to my Gospel; his meaning is not that the Gospel will be the,
        rule of judgment, because he speaking of the judgment of the Gentiles,
        as well as of the Jews, who never heard of the Gospel; but that what he
        had said concerning a day of judgment, of Christ's being the Judge, and
        of God's judging by him the secrets of men, were as true and as certain
        as the Gospel which he preached was; and was "conformable", or agreeable
        to it, as the Arabic version reads it, and might be learned and proved
        from it. This he calls, "my Gospel"; not because the author or subject
        of it; but because it was committed to his trust and was preached by
        him; and in opposition to, and to distinguish it from the Gospel of the
        false apostles. Eusebius says (u), that the Apostle Paul had used to
        call the Gospel according to Luke his Gospel, and that it is said, that
        whenever he makes mention of his Gospel, he designs that.
