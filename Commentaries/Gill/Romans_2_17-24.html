      Behold, thou art called a Jew,.... From hence to the end of the chapter
      the Jews are particularly addressed; their several privileges and
      characters are commemorated, which by an ironical concession are allowed
      them; several charges are brought against them, even against their
      principal men; and the plea in favour of them, from their circumcision, is
      considered; and the apostle's view in the whole, is to show that they
      could not be justified before God by their obedience to the law of Moses:
      "behold"; take notice, observe it, this will be granted: "thou art called
      a Jew"; thou art one by name, by nation, and by religion; but no name, nor
      outward religion, nor a mere profession, will justify before God:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and restest in the law; which may be understood of their having the law
        and the knowledge of it, what is to be done and avoided easily, without
        any fatigue and labour; of their pleasing and applauding themselves with
        the bare having and hearing of it; of their trust and confidence in it;
        and of their inactivity and security in it, as persons asleep; and so of
        their coming short of the knowledge of the Gospel, and of Christ the end
        of the law for righteousness, their whole confidence being placed in
        that: so the Targumist in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008">Jer 8:8</a> paraphrases the
        words,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"we are wise, "and in the law of the Lord", , do we trust;''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and makest thy boast of God. There is a right boasting of God in
        opposition to boasting in the creature, when men ascribe all the
        blessings of nature and grace to the Lord alone, and praise him for all
        their enjoyments, temporal and spiritual; and when they trust in, and
        glory, and make their boast of Christ as the Lord their righteousness,
        in whom alone they are, and can be justified. But the boasting here
        spoken of, was such that was not right; these men boasted of their bare
        external knowledge of the one God, when the Gentiles around them were
        ignorant of him; of their being the covenant people of God, when others
        were aliens and strangers; and of their having the word and worship of
        the true God, which other nations were unacquainted with; and, on these
        external things they depended, which was their fault.

      And knowest his will,.... Not the secret will or purpose of God; nor his
      revealed will in the Gospel, for of this they were ignorant; but his
      declared will in the law, showing what is to be done, and what is not to
      be done: to know which in express terms was a privilege, that other people
      had not; but then the bare knowledge of this will be of no avail: for
      persons may know their Lord's will, as the Jews did, and not do it, and so
      be worthy to be beaten with many stripes:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and approvest the things that are more excellent: or "triest the things
        that differ"; from one another, and from the will and law of God; or as
        the Syriac, "discernest" "things that are convenient"; agreeable, which
        are fit and ought to be done: and having tried and discerned them, they
        approved of them in their judgment as the things more excellent; but
        then they did not put these excellent things in practice which they
        approved of; and the knowledge and approbation they had of these things,
        arose from their
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        being instructed out of the law, and not the Gospel; for the excellent
        things of the Gospel, they had no discerning, knowledge and approbation
        of; see

      And art confident that thou thyself,.... Being vainly puffed up in, their
      fleshly minds, they were strongly persuaded that they were very fit
      persons to be
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a guide to the blind: all men are by nature blind, as to the knowledge
        of divine and spiritual things; the meaner sort of the people among the
        Jews seem to be intended here; or else the ignorant Gentiles, whom the
        Jews were very fond of making proselytes to their religion and laws; but
        miserable guides were they, whether to their own people, or others;
        blind guides of the blind. Gospel ministers best deserve this title:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a light of them that are in darkness; so Christ, John the Baptist, the
        disciples of Christ, and all Gospel ministers are; but these men, who
        arrogated such characters to themselves, were dim lights, and dark
        lanterns. The apostle seems to have respect to those very high and
        exalted characters the Jews give of their doctors, as when they call
        one, , "the lamp of light" (w); another, "the holy lamps" (x); and a
        third, , "the lamp of Israel" (y); with many others of the same kind;

      An instructor of the foolish,.... All men in a state of unregeneracy are
      foolish, and need instruction; here the common people among the Jews, who
      knew not the law, are meant; it was very usual to call anyone of their
      doctors and masters "an instructor": it follows,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a teacher of babes; either in age or in understanding; such who taught
        either of them were called by the Jews , "teachers of babes". Thus they
        paraphrase the text in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003">Dan 12:3</a>,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "they that be wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament. This
        is the Judge who judges, the judgment of truth truly, and the collectors
        of alms: and they that turn, many to righteousness, as the stars for
        ever and ever; these are, , "the teachers of babes" (z).''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Though these are said (a) to be inferior to the wise men, or doctors:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law: they had
        not a true knowledge of the law; only a draught and scheme, the outward
        form of the law, and a mere shadow and appearance of the knowledge of
        the truth of it. From hence the apostle would have it concluded, that
        though the Jews had the law, and in some sense knew it, yet inasmuch as
        they did not perform it, they could not be justified by it; and that
        even their teachers, their greatest masters and doctors, were very
        deficient, as appears from what follows; and since they could not be
        instilled by it, who taught others the knowledge of it, the hearers of
        it could not expect justification from it.

      Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?....
      Several charges are here brought against the Jews, even against their
      teachers; for though they are put by way of question, they are to be
      considered as so many assertions and matters of fact; thus, though they
      taught others, they did not teach themselves; they were blind leaders of
      the blind; they were ignorant of the law, of the spirituality of it; they
      were desirous to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they
      said, nor whereof they affirmed: they were ignorant of the righteousness
      of God, of whom they boasted; and of the more excellent things of Moses,
      and the prophets, they pretended to explain; and of the Messiah, of whom
      their prophecies so much spoke: and besides, what they did understand and
      teach, they did not practise themselves; than which nothing is more
      shameful, or more betrays stupidity and ignorance; for as they themselves
      (b) say,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "he that teaches men, , "that which he himself does not do", is like a
        blind man who has a lamp in his hand, and enlightens others, but he,
        himself walks in darkness.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And such teachers they own were among them.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Beautiful (say they (c)) are the words which come out of the mouths of
        them that do, them: Ben Assai was a beautiful preacher, but did not well
        observe;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>i.e., to do what he said.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Thou that preach at a man should not steal, dost thou steal? some
        understand this figuratively, of stealing, or taking away the true sense
        of the law, and putting a false one upon it; of which these men were
        notoriously guilty: but rather, it is to be understood literally, not
        only of the inward desires and motions of their minds after this sin,
        and of their consenting to, and conniving at theft and robbery, but of
        their doing it themselves; who, under pretence of long prayers,
        "devoured widows' houses",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014">Mat 23:14</a>, plundered and
        robbed them of their substance: no wonder that these men preferred
        Barabbas, a thief and a robber, to Jesus Christ.

      Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery,.... Adultery here is to
      be taken not figuratively for adulterating the word of God, and mixing it
      with their own inventions; but literally for the sin of adultery, and that
      not in heart only, but in act:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        dost thou commit adultery? an iniquity which greatly prevailed among the
        Jews at this time of day; hence Christ calls them "an adulterous
        generation",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039">Mat 12:39</a>; and that to
        such a degree, that by the advice of their great Rabbi, R. Jochanan ben
        Zaccai, they left off the trial of the suspected woman, cases of this
        nature being so very numerous: and this sin prevailed not only among the
        common people, but among their principal doctors; as may be learnt from
        their own writings, and from that conviction of this iniquity which the
        Scribes and Pharisees were brought under by Christ, when the woman,
        taken in adultery, was had before him by them,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#009">Joh 8:9</a>.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? for though at
        this time they abhorred idolatry, to which their forefathers were so
        much inclined, and so often fell into, yet they were guilty of
        sacrilege; by violating the worship of God, and polluting it with their
        own inventions; by pillaging or withholding, or not offering the
        sacrifices they ought; and by plundering the temple, and converting the
        sacred things of it to their own use.

      </p>
      Thou that makest thy boast of the law,.... Of their having it, which other
      nations had not; of their knowledge of it, which many of their own people
      were without, or had but a small share of; and of their keeping of it even
      to perfection:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through breaking of the law dishonourest thou God? sin sometimes is
        expressed by a word which signifies a "fall"; sometimes by another,
        which signifies missing of the mark, or straying from it; sometimes by
        another, which signifies a "contrariety to the law" of God; and here, by
        one which signifies a "passing over it", and the bounds which it has
        set, as the rule of man's obedience; and hereby God, the lawgiver, is
        dishonoured: for as God is glorified by good works, when rightly
        performed, he is dishonoured by evil ones; for his authority, as a
        lawgiver, is trampled upon and despised. Now persons guilty of such
        iniquities as here mentioned, could not be justified before God, or
        accepted by him on account of any works of righteousness done by them.

      For the name of God is blasphemed,.... The being and perfections of God,
      such as his holiness, omniscience, and omnipotence, are denied, or evil
      spoken of; and also the law of God, and the forms of worship instituted by
      him:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        among the Gentiles through you: through their iniquities, who when they
        observe them, conclude that the God of Israel is not omniscient, or he
        would know, and take notice of these things; and that he is not holy, or
        he could not bear them; nor omnipotent, or he would revenge them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as it is written; the passage or passages referred to are not mentioned,
        but are perhaps <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005">Isa 52:5</a>.
        In the former of these texts the words are, "they that rule over them
        make them to howl; saith the Lord, and my name continually every day is
        blasphemed"; which are spoken of the rulers of the people, either of
        their ecclesiastical or political rulers, or both; and so Aben Ezra
        interprets them of , "the great men of Israel"; and here by the apostle
        are applied to their doctors and wise men: and in the latter are these
        words, "thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your sakes, O house
        of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the
        Heathen"; that is, by their unbecoming walk and conversation, and
        especially by the disagreeable conduct of their principal men: and the
        Jews own the same things, and complain of them in much the "same
        language the apostle here does, saying, "they disgrace the law before
        the people of the earth, (the common people, or else the Gentiles,) how?
        a wise man sits and expounds in the congregation, saying, thou shalt not
        lend upon usury, and he lends upon usury; he says, thou shalt not commit
        a robbery, and he commits a robbery; he says, , "thou shalt not steal,
        and he steals": says R. Berechiah, it happened to one man that his cloak
        was stolen from him, and he went before the judge about it, and he found
        it spread upon his bed or couch: and, says the same Rabbi, it happened
        to a certain man that his pot was stolen from him, and he went before
        the judge about it, and he found it upon his hearth: hence it is said,
        "as they were increased they sinned against me, therefore will I change
        their glory into shame",
