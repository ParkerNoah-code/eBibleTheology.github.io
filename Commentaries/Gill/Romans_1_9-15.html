      For God is my witness, whom I serve,.... These words are an appeal to God,
      and carry in them the nature and form of an oath; the reason of the
      apostle's using it was, because he was personally unknown to the Romans,
      and they to him, and so might doubt of his affectionate regard unto them;
      and therefore for the confirmation thereof he uses it: this was a case
      which was only known to God and himself, and hence he appeals to him for
      the truth of it. The object of his oath or appeal, or by which he speaks,
      is not himself, or anything that belonged to him, nor any creature in
      heaven or on earth, but God; who in a solemn oath is only to be appealed
      to and sworn by: he describes him as the God "whom he served", to
      distinguish him from all false gods, and to show that he that takes an
      oath, should be one that fears and serves the Lord; what he served him in
      was not the law, but
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the Gospel of his Son; Jesus Christ, who is the author, minister, and
        subject matter of it: he served him in it, by preaching, spreading, and
        defending it. This is a service, and a very laborious one, and makes for
        the honour and glory of God. The manner in which he served him was, as
        he says,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        with my Spirit; either with the Spirit of God, which was given to him;
        or in a spiritual manner, in opposition to the carnal worship of the
        Jews; internally, in opposition to bodily exercise only, and
        voluntarily, with his whole heart, soul, and spirit. The matter or
        substance of his appeal or oath was,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; whence
        may be observed, that prayer to God ought to be constant; and that we
        should be concerned for others as well as for ourselves; all the saints
        should share therein.

      Making request, if by any means now at length,.... A principal thing,
      which be incessantly and importunately requested at the throne of grace,
      was, that he might have an opportunity of coming to them; that God in his
      providence would open a way for him; and that he might have a safe and
      comfortable journey in a very little time; all which he submits to the
      will of God, as a good man ought to do; and which he thus expresses,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God, to come unto you;
        see

      For I long to see you,.... Not the city of Rome, which was one of Austin's
      three wishes to have seen in its glory; nor the emperor of it, nor the
      senate in it, nor its populous inhabitants, fine buildings, riches and
      grandeur; but the poor saints there, which were the excellent men of the
      earth, of the whole Roman empire, and in whom was his delight: his desire
      to see them was not to gratify his curiosity, nor to spend his time in
      idle chat with them, nor with a view to enrich himself by them; but, says
      he,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that I may impart some spiritual gift: not any extraordinary gift of the
        Spirit; but spiritual light, knowledge, peace, and comfort, through the
        exercise of his ministerial gift: whence it may be observed, that that
        which qualities men for the preaching of the word to the profit of
        others, is a gift, a gift by grace; a spiritual one, which comes from
        the Spirit of God, and may be, and is to be imparted to others in the
        free use and exercise of it; and that,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to the end that saints may be established; for such who are called by
        grace, need establishing. They are indeed in a safe state and condition;
        they are encircled in the arms of everlasting love, they are fixed in
        the hands of Christ, secured in an everlasting covenant, established on
        the rock of ages, and settled in a state from whence they can never
        fall: yet, notwithstanding this, they are sometimes very unstable in
        their hearts, in their frames, in the exercise of grace, and the
        discharge of duty, and in professing and adhering to the doctrines of
        the Gospel; wherefore they need establishing, as to a more firm
        persuasion of interest in the love of God, and in the covenant of grace,
        as to a more stable exercise of grace in Christ, and as to a more
        constant discharge of duty, and steady profession of adherence to the
        truths of the Gospel; to all which the ministration of the word has a
        tendency, with a divine blessing.

      </p>
      That is, that I may be comforted together with you,.... This is a further
      explanation of his view, in being desirous of coming to them, and
      preaching: the Gospel among them; for what makes for establishment, makes
      for comfort; and what makes for comfort, makes for establishment; and when
      souls are established, ministers are comforted as well as they; and whilst
      ministers are imparting their spiritual gifts for the use of others, they
      themselves are sometimes comforted of God in their work, and particularly
      when they find there is an agreement between their doctrine, and the
      experience of the saints:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by the mutual faith both of you and me. The grace of faith is the same
        in all the saints, and so is the doctrine of it, as dispensed by
        Christ's faithful ministers, and experimentally received and embraced by
        his people; the consideration of which has a very great influence on the
        comfort and establishment of each other; nor are any so perfect, but
        they may receive benefit from others, even though inferior to them.

      Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren,.... The apostle calls them
      brethren, because many of them were Jews, his brethren and kinsmen
      according to the flesh, and all of them were his brethren in a spiritual
      relation; and this he does to express his affection to them, and engage
      their attention and credit to him, and particularly to this matter which
      he now acquaints them with, being unwilling they should be ignorant of it;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you: it was not a sudden start
        of mind, or a desire that lately arose up in him, but a settled
        resolution and determination, and which he had often made:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but was let hitherto; either by God, who had work for him to do in other
        places; or by Satan, who sometimes by divine permission has had such
        power and influence; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#018">Th1 2:18</a>, or through the
        urgent necessities of other churches, which required his stay with them
        longer than he intended: his end in taking up at several times such a
        resolution of coming to them was, says he,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
        Gentiles: by fruit he means, not any reward of his labour, either
        temporal or eternal; but the conversion of sinners, the edification of
        saints, and the fruitfulness of believers in grace and works. The
        apostle seems to allude to the casting of seed into the earth: Christ's
        ministers' are husbandmen, who sow the seed of the word, which lies some
        time under the clods; wherefore patience is necessary to wait its
        springing up, first in the blade, and then in the ear, then in the full
        corn in the ear, when it brings forth fruit; all which depend on the
        blessing of God: and when he adds, "as among other Gentiles", his design
        is not so much to let them know that they were as other Gentiles, upon a
        level with them, had no pre-eminence as citizens of Rome, over other
        saints, being all one in Christ Jesus; as to observe to them his success
        in other places, where he had been preaching the Gospel of the grace of
        God.

      I am a debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians,.... The meaning
      is, that he was obliged by the call he had from God, the injunction that
      was laid upon him by him, and the gifts with which he was qualified, to
      preach the Gospel to all sorts of men; who are here distinguished into
      Greeks and Barbarians: sometimes by Greeks are meant the Gentiles in
      general, in opposition to the Jews; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016">Rom 1:16</a>; but here they
      design only a part of the Gentiles, the inhabitants of Greece, in
      opposition to all the world besides; for the Greeks used to call all
      others that were not of themselves Barbarians (e): or else by Greeks are
      meant the more cultivated nations of the world, and by Barbarians the
      ruder and more uncivil parts of it; to which agrees the next division of
      mankind,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        both to the wise and to the unwise. The Gospel was to be preached "to
        the wise"; such who thought themselves to be so, and were so with
        respect to human wisdom and knowledge; though it should be despised by
        them, as it was, and though few of them were called by it, some were,
        and still are, though not many; and such wisdom there is in the Gospel,
        as the wisest of men may learn by it, will be entertaining to them, is
        far beyond their contempt, and what will serve to exercise their talents
        and abilities, to search into the knowledge of, and rightly to
        understand; and it must be preached "to the unwise"; for such God has
        chosen to confound the wise; these he calls by his grace, and reveals
        his Gospel to, whilst he hides it from the wise and prudent; and there
        is that in the Gospel which is plain and easy to the weakest mind,
        enlightened by the Spirit of God.

      So, as much as in me is, I am ready,.... This explains what he was a
      debtor to one and another for, namely,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to preach the Gospel; expresses the readiness of his mind to that work,
        whatever difficulties lay in his way; and declares what a willing mind
        he had to preach it also to the Romans, as elsewhere:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to you that are at Rome also; the metropolis of the Roman empire, a very
        public place, the seat of Satan, and where was the heat of persecution.
