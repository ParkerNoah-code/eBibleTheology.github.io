      What shall we say then?.... A form of expression the apostle frequently
      uses, when he is about to introduce an objection, as is what follows:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        is there unrighteousness with God? This is not an objection of his own,
        but of an adversary, which he takes up and returns an answer to; and
        which itself greatly serves to settle and confirm the true sense and
        meaning of the apostle in this place; as that it could not be, that
        election and rejection of men should proceed according to their merits;
        or that God chooses some for their good works, and rejects others for
        their wicked works, because no man could ever pretend to charge God with
        unrighteousness on this account; nor could it be that God chose and
        rejected men, upon a foresight of their good and evil works, for this
        also would not be liable to such an objection; nor that the Jews, having
        made the law of none effect by their traditions, despised the Gospel,
        crucified Christ, and persecuted his disciples, are therefore cast off,
        and the Gentiles, being obedient both in word and deed, are received
        into favour, for this likewise would not be chargeable with
        unrighteousness by men; but that two persons, as Jacob and Esau, and the
        same may be said of all mankind, being upon an equal foot, not being yet
        born, nor having done either good or evil, an inequality, a difference
        is made between them, by God himself; the one is chose, the other passed
        by: now in this is some show, some pretence at least, for such an
        objection; nor is it any wonder to meet with it from the carnal reason
        of men; wherefore we may be sure that the latter, and not either of the
        former, is the true sense of the apostle; since only this, and not
        either of them, is liable to such an exception: let us attend to the
        apostle's answer, which is "first" in his usual manner, by way of
        detestation and abhorrence,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God forbid: God is not unrighteous in his nature; nor in any of his ways
        and works; nor in this, in choosing some and rejecting others. There is
        no unrighteousness with God in that part of predestination, commonly
        called election; for this is neither an act of justice, nor injustice;
        not of justice, but of grace and mercy; of undue and undeserved grace
        and mercy, of mere sovereign grace and mercy; and is what God was not
        obliged to do; wherefore to choose some and not others, is no act of
        injustice; for injustice is a violation of justice, which has no place
        in this affair: if it is an act of injustice, it must be either to them
        that are chosen, or to them that are not; not to them that are chosen,
        to them it is an act of favour and good will, they are chosen to grace
        and glory, to holiness here, and happiness hereafter; not to them that
        are passed by, because they had no right nor claim to the grace and
        glory, which by this act are denied them, and therefore no injustice is
        done them. Every prince may choose his own ministers and favourites, and
        who he will have of his privy council, without doing any injustice, to
        those he takes no notice of; every man may choose his own company who he
        will converse with, without doing any wrong to such he does not think
        fit to admit to an intimacy with him; and yet men are not willing to
        allow the Most High that liberty, which every man daily takes, and may
        lawfully make use of: nor is there any unrighteousness with God in the
        other branch of predestination, commonly called reprobation, which is
        either negative or positive; negative reprobation is the act of
        preterition, or God's passing by, leaving, taking no notice of some,
        while he chose others: now the objects of this act are to be considered
        either in the pure, or in the corrupt mass; if in the pure mass, i.e. of
        creatureship, which seems to be the apostle's meaning, as being not yet
        created, made, or born, and having done neither good nor evil; no
        injustice is done by this act, for as it found them, it left them; it
        put nothing into them, no evil in them, nor appointed them to any, of
        any kind; man after, and notwithstanding this act, came into the world
        an upright creature, and became sinful, not by virtue of this act, but
        by their own inventions: or if considered as in the corrupt mass, as
        fallen creatures, sunk into sin and misery, which is the case of all
        mankind; since God was not obliged to save any of the sinful race of
        men, whose destruction was of themselves, it could be no injustice to
        pass by some of them in this condition, when he chose others; for if it
        would have been no injustice to have condemned all, as he did the angels
        that sinned, whom he spared not, it can be no act of injustice in him,
        to leave some of them in that condition, which sin had brought them
        into, whilst he has mercy on others; unless to have mercy on any, can be
        thought to be an act of injustice: what unrighteousness can there be in
        this procedure, any more than in drowning the world of the ungodly,
        whilst Noah and his family were saved in the ark? or in raining showers
        of fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities of the
        plain, whilst Lot, his wife, and two daughters, were delivered from the
        same? Positive reprobation is the decree, or appointment to damnation:
        now as God damns no man but for sin, so he has decreed to damn no man
        but for sin; and if it is no unrighteousness in him to damn men for sin,
        as to be sure it is not, so it can be no unrighteousness in him to
        decree to damn any for it: upon the whole it appears, that whatever
        show, upon first sight, there may be for a charge of unrighteousness
        against such a procedure of the Divine Being, there is no real
        foundation for it. The objection is to be treated with abhorrence and
        indignation.

      For he saith to Moses,.... That is, God said to Moses. The apostle goes on
      to answer to the above objections, by producing some testimonies out of
      the writings of Moses, in favour of both branches of predestination;
      showing, that the doctrine he had advanced, was no other than what God
      himself had delivered to Moses, whose name and writings were in great
      esteem with the Jews, whereby the apostle might hope to give full
      satisfaction in this point. The first passage he cites, is in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019">Exo 33:19</a>.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on
        whom I will show mercy. This is produced, in favour of special,
        particular, and personal election, and to clear it from any charge of
        unrighteousness; and by it, it appears, that God bestows his grace and
        mercy in time, on such persons he has willed and determined from all
        eternity to bestow it; this, is clear from hence, for since all this is
        dependent on his will, it must be as this was his will from eternity,
        seeing no new will can possibly arise in God, God wills nothing in time,
        but what he willed before time; that this grace and mercy are shown only
        to some persons, and that the only reason of this is his sovereign will
        and pleasure, and not the works and merits of men; wherefore since this
        grace and mercy rise out of his own free good will and pleasure, and are
        by no means the creature's due, it most clearly follows, that God in
        determining to bestow his grace and mercy, and in the actual doing of
        it, whilst he determines to deny it, and does deny it to others, cannot
        possibly be chargeable with any unrighteousness.

      So then it is not of him that willeth,.... This is not a consequence drawn
      by an adversary, showing that if this be the case, it signifies nothing
      for men to will or do, they may even sit still and do nothing, but depend
      on the mercy of God; but this is a conclusion of the apostle's from the
      above cited testimony, inferring from thence, that election, which is what
      he is discoursing of, is "not of him that willeth",
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor of him that runneth: that is, is not owing to the will or works of
        men, to the desires, inclinations, and affections of their minds, or to
        the actions of their lives; these are not the motives, conditions, or
        causes of this act:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but of God that sheweth mercy; in a free sovereign way and manner, which
        he is not obliged to by anything the creature wills or works; he is at
        full liberty, notwithstanding whatever they will or do, to give his
        grace and mercy, when, where, and to whom he pleases; and therefore to
        give it to some, and deny it to others, can never be accounted an act of
        injustice, since he is not bound to give it to any. Some make the it to
        be the blessing of Isaac, which was not of the will of any of the
        parties concerned; not of Isaac who willed it to Esau; nor of Esau who
        willed it to himself, but had it not; nor of the will of the persons who
        had their desires, not of the will of Rebecca, who was desirous of it
        for her son Jacob, nor of the will of Jacob, who desired it for himself,
        though he had it; nor of either of them that ran, not of Esau, who made
        haste to hunt for, and prepare venison for his father, nor of Jacob, who
        ran to the flock, for two kids of the goats; but of God that showed
        mercy to him, who, according to his sovereign will and pleasure, had
        signified before to Rebecca, that "the elder should serve the younger",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023">Gen 25:23</a>, as the apostle
        had mentioned this so lately, it might still be in his thoughts, and he
        may allude to it; but election being what he is discoursing of in the
        context, that is the "it" here designed; and what is true of that, is
        true of salvation in all its parts, and therefore some understand it in
        the large sense of salvation; though by others so qualified and limited,
        as to spoil the glory of the text: some saying that the sense is, it is
        not of him that willeth and runneth wrong, but of the grace and mercy of
        God; but as no man would ever assert, that salvation is of him that
        wills and runs wrong, so the apostle had no occasion to deny it: others
        say, that it is not only of him that wills, and only of him that runs,
        but also of God that shows mercy; making man's will and works joint
        causes with the mercy of God in man's salvation; and besides, as Austin
        (k) long ago observes, according to this sense, the words might as well
        be read, it is not only of God that shows mercy, but of him that
        willeth, and of him that runneth, which no Christian would dare to say:
        the true sense is, that as election, which is the leading step to
        salvation, is not owing at all to the will of men, but to the good
        pleasure and will of God; and not at all to the works of men, that being
        done before them, and they being the fruits and effects of that, but to
        the free love, grace, and good will of God; so salvation in all its
        parts and branches, as redemption, justification, regeneration, calling,
        and conversion, faith, repentance, hope, love, &amp;c. and eternal life,
        is not to be ascribed at all to the will of men, nor at all to the works
        of men, but entirely and alone to the love, grace, and mercy of God
        through Christ.

      For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh,.... , "The Scripture saith", is a
      Talmudic (l) way of speaking, used when any point is proved from
      Scripture; and is of the same signification with , "the merciful God
      says"; and so the sense of it here is, God said to Pharaoh; the testimony
      here cited, stands in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016">Exo 9:16</a>; where it is read
      thus, "for this cause have I raised thee up", or "made thee stand", "for
      to show in thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all
      the earth"; and is produced by the apostle in proof of the other branch of
      predestination, called reprobation, and to vindicate it from the charge of
      unrighteousness: in which may be observed, that the act of raising up of
      Pharaoh is God's act,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        even for this same purpose have I raised thee up; which may be
        understood in every sense that is put upon that phrase, unless that
        which some Jewish (m) writers have annexed to it, namely, that God
        raised Pharaoh from the dead; otherwise, I say, all the rest may well
        enough be thought to be comprised in it; as that God ordained and
        appointed him from eternity, by certain means to this end; that he made
        him to exist in time, or brought him into being; that he raised him to
        the throne, promoted him to that high honour and dignity; that he
        preserved him, and did not cut him off as yet; that he strengthened and
        hardened his heart, irritated, provoked, and stirred him up against his
        people Israel; and suffered him to go all the lengths he did, in his
        obstinacy and rebellion: all which was done,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that I might shew my power in thee; his superior power to him, his
        almighty power in destroying him and his host in the Red sea, when the
        Israelites were saved: and the ultimate end which God had in view in
        this was,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that my name might be declared throughout all the earth; that he himself
        might be glorified, and that the glory of his perfections, particularly
        of his wisdom, power, and justice, might be celebrated throughout the
        world. The sum of it is, that this man was raised up by God in every
        sense, for God to show his power in his destruction, that he might be
        glorified; from whence the apostle deduces the following conclusion.

      Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will,.... These are the express words
      of the former testimony: it follows,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and whom he will he hardeneth; which is the just and natural consequence
        of what is contained in the latter; for if God could, or he did, without
        any injustice, raise up Pharaoh, and harden his heart against him and
        his people, that he might rise up against him and destroy him by his
        power for his own glory, then he may harden any other person, and even
        whom he will: now this hardening of men's hearts may be understood in
        perfect agreement with the justice and holiness of God: men first harden
        their own hearts by sinning, as Pharaoh did; what God does, is by
        leaving them to the hardness of their hearts, denying them that grace
        which only can soften them, and which he is not obliged to give, and
        therefore does them no injustice in withholding it from them; by sending
        them both mercies and judgments, which through the corruption of their
        hearts, are the means of the greater hardening of them; so judgments in
        the case of Pharaoh, and mercies in the case of others; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010">Isa 6:10</a>; by delivering
        them up into the hands of Satan, and to their own lusts, which they
        themselves approve of; and by giving them up to a judicial blindness and
        hardness of heart, as a just punishment for their impieties.
