      What then? are we better than they?.... The apostle returns to what he was
      treating of in the beginning of the chapter, and suggests, that though the
      Jew has the advantage of the Gentile, with respect to some external
      privileges, yet not with regard to their state and condition God-ward, and
      as in his sight; "are we Jews better than they Gentiles?"
      <p></p>
      <p>
        no, in no wise; upon no consideration whatever, neither as men, nor as
        Jews; which is directly opposite to a notion that people have of
        themselves:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "in mankind (they say (r)) there are high degrees, one higher than
        another, and the Israelites , "are above all mankind"; they are the
        head, and the nations of the world are the tail, and are like to a
        serpent, for they come from the filth of the old serpent.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Again, they say (s),</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "worthy are the Israelites, for the holy blessed God hath given to them
        holy souls, from an holy place, "above all the rest of the people", that
        they may do the commandments, and delight in the law.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And elsewhere (t) it is observed on those words (Gen 1:24) "the living
        creature", or "the soul of the living creature", by R. Aba:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "these are the Israelites, for they are the children of the holy blessed
        God, and their holy souls come from him; the souls of the rest of the
        people, from what place are they? says R. Eleazar, from the side of the
        left hand, which is defiled; for they have polluted souls, and therefore
        they are all defiled, and defile whoever comes nigh them:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but they are no better, especially with regard to their estate by
        nature:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for we have before proved; in the preceding chapters, by full instances
        to a demonstration; and if that cannot be thought sufficient, he goes on
        to give more proof in the following "verses":
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that both Jews and Gentiles are under sin; under the power and guilt of
        sin, and a sentence of condemnation for it; which is equally true of the
        Jews, who were no better than the Gentiles, for being Abraham's seed,
        for being circumcised, for having the ceremonial law, and other outward
        privileges; for they were equally born in sin, and by practice sinners,
        as the Gentiles: and this is true of God's elect in all nations, who are
        no better by nature, by birth, than others; as deserving of the wrath of
        God as the rest; no better in their tempers and, dispositions, or in the
        endowments of their minds, or outward circumstances of life; nor better
        qualified to receive and improve the grace of God bestowed on them, than
        others.

      As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one. The several
      passages cited here, and in some following verses, are taken out of the
      Psalms and Isaiah; and are brought to prove, not only that the Jews are no
      better than the Gentiles, being equally corrupt and depraved as they; but
      also to show the corrupt state and condition of mankind in general: and
      the words are not always literally expressed, but the sense is attended
      to, as in this passage; for in the original text of
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001">Psa 14:1</a>, it is, "there is
      none that doth good"; from whence the apostle rightly infers, "there is
      none righteous"; for he that does not do good, is not righteous; and
      therefore if there is none on earth that does good and does not sin, there
      is none righteous upon earth, "no, not one" single person. The Jews
      allegorizing that passage in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#031">Gen 19:31</a>, "there is not a
      man in the earth to come into us", remark (u) on it thus,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Urab qydu vya Nya, "there is not a righteous man in the earth"; and
        there is not a man that rules over his imagination.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        There is none righteous as Adam was, in a state of innocence; for all
        have sinned, and are filled with unrighteousness, and are enemies to
        righteousness; none are righteous by their obedience to the law of
        works; nor are there any righteous in the sight of God, upon the foot of
        their own righteousness, however they may appear in their own eyes, and
        in the sight of others; nor are any inherently righteous, for there is
        none without sin, sanctification is imperfect; nor is it, either in
        whole or in part, a saint's justifying righteousness; indeed there is
        none righteous, no, not one, but those who are justified by the
        righteousness of Christ imputed to them.

      There is none that understandeth,.... This is rightly concluded, from what
      the Psalmist says (Psa 14:2)
      "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men", on all the
      children of men, Jews and Gentiles, "to see if there were any that did
      understand"; and it appears, upon this survey of them, there was not one
      understanding person among them: man thinks himself a very wise and
      understanding creature, though he is born a very ignorant one: true
      indeed, he has not lost by sin the natural faculty of the understanding,
      so as to become like the horse and mule, which are without any; and it
      must be allowed, that natural men have some understanding of things
      natural, civil, and moral; though there is none that understands even
      these, as Adam did: but then they have no understanding of things
      spiritual; no spiritual knowledge of God; no true sense of themselves,
      their sin and misery; nor do they truly know the way of salvation by
      Christ; nor have they any experience of the work of the Spirit of God upon
      their souls; nor any experimental knowledge of the doctrines of the
      Gospel: no man can understand these of himself, by the mere strength of
      reason, and light of nature; nor can even a spiritual man fully understand
      them in this life; in consequence of this account and character of men it
      follows, that
      <p></p>
      <p>
        there is none that seeketh after God; that worships him in Spirit and in
        truth, or prays to him with the Spirit, and with the understanding; who
        seek him chiefly, and in the first place, with their whole hearts,
        earnestly, diligently, and constantly; who seek him in Christ, and under
        the assistance of the Spirit; who seek after the knowledge of God in
        Christ, communion with him through the Mediator, or his honour and
        glory.

      They are all gone out of the way,.... In
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003">Psa 14:3</a>; it is said, "they
      are all gone aside"; as persons in debt: man had a considerable stock of
      righteousness, holiness, knowledge, &amp;c. but he has run through all,
      has contracted large and numerous debts, has been obliged to hide himself,
      has been used as a bankrupt, and turned out of house and home: Christ
      indeed has undertook to pay, and he has paid all the debts of his people;
      and has put them into a better state than ever Adam was in: in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003">Psa 53:3</a>, it is rendered,
      "everyone of them is gone back"; that is, from God; from his commands, and
      from their former state and condition: here the phrase is rendered by the
      apostle, "they are all gone out of the way": that is, out of the way of
      God and his precepts, out of the way of holiness and righteousness, of
      light and life; into their own ways, the ways of sin, Satan, and the world
      of darkness, and of death: so Aben Ezra explains it, "out of the right
      way"; Kimchi and Ben Melech paraphrase it, "out of the good way: and so"
      <p></p>
      <p>
        they are together become unprofitable; the word in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#003">Psa 14:3</a> and
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa053.htm#003">Psa 53:3</a>; is translated,
        "they are become filthy"; which R. Aben Ezra interprets by "they are
        corrupt"; and R. Solomon Jarchi by , "they are turned to corruption";
        the metaphor is taken from stinking flesh, which is tainted and
        corrupted, and so good for nothing, hence here rendered "unprofitable";
        for so men being corrupted by sin, are of no use, service, and advantage
        to God, to men, or to themselves; but, on the contrary, nauseous to God,
        and to all that are good, and hurtful to themselves and others: for
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        there is none that does good, no, not one; and therefore must be
        unprofitable. There is none that can do good in a spiritual manner,
        without the grace of God, strength from Christ, and the assistance of
        the Spirit; and there is not even a spiritual man, that can do good
        perfectly, and without sin.

      Their throat is an open sepulchre,.... The several vices of the
      instruments of speech are here, and in the following verse, exposed: "the
      throat" is said to "be an open sepulchre", as in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009">Psa 5:9</a>, so called, for its
      voracity and insatiableness; both as an instrument of speech, for the
      words of the wicked are devouring ones; and as an instrument of
      swallowing, and so may denote the sinner's eager desire after sin, the
      delight and pleasure he takes in it, the abundance of it he takes in, and
      his insatiable greediness for it; likewise for its filthy stench, the
      communication of evil men being corrupt; and because, as by an open grave,
      persons may fall unawares to their hurt, so the evil communications of
      wicked men, as they corrupt good manners, are dangerous and hurtful: R.
      Aben Ezra explains it by , "immediate destruction", or sudden death:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        with their tongues they have used deceit; which may design the sin of
        flattery, for the words in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#009">Psa 5:9</a>; the place
        referred to, are, "they flatter with their tongue"; either God or men,
        themselves or others, their princes or their neighbour; for there are
        flatterers in things sacred and civil, there are self-flatterers, court
        flatterers, and flattering preachers, and all abominable and
        mischievous; or the phrase may design the sin of lying, either
        politically, officiously, perniciously, and religiously; and in this
        latter way, either with respect to doctrine or practice:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the poison of asps is under their lips; or as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#003">Psa 140:3</a>, "adders' poison
        is under their lips". The asp is but a small creature, and so is the
        tongue (Jam 3:5) but there
        is a world of mischief in it, signified by poison; which, as that, is
        latent and secret, is under it; and as that stupefies and kills
        insensibly, so an evil tongue does, and that in a deadly and incurable
        manner: oftentimes the Jews speak of the evil imagination, or corruption
        of nature entering into persons, and operating in them, "as poison in an
        angry serpent" (w).

      Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. These words are taken from
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa010.htm#007">Psa 10:7</a>, by cursing is
      meant, cursing of God, which is sometimes internal with the heart, and
      sometimes external with the mouth, as here; and of all good men, though
      without cause, and to no purpose with respect to the persons they curse,
      since God has blessed them, and they are blessed, and greatly to their own
      detriment, for, in the issue, their curses will be turned against
      themselves. There is also a cursing of superiors, as parents, masters,
      magistrates, kings, and governors; which is a sore evil, and attended with
      bad consequences; likewise of themselves, and their fellow creatures: and
      "the mouth being full of it", denotes the frequency of the sin; scarce
      anything else comes out of it but cursing; which discovers the sad
      corruption of the heart; "for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
      speaketh", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#034">Mat 12:34</a>. By
      "bitterness" is meant, either sin in general, which is "an evil and bitter
      thing" (Jer 2:19) in its
      nature and effects; or sinful words, such as oaths, curses, imprecations,
      all wrathful and deceitful words.

      Their feet are swift to shed blood. The sins of the heart and mouth are
      before described, and now the sins of action are taken notice of; for "the
      feet" are the instruments of motion and action: and when these are said to
      be "swift to shed blood", it denotes the readiness and eagerness of men,
      to murder innocent creatures; which shows the dreadful malice and hatred
      that is in them. The words are cited from
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007">Isa 59:7</a>, and seem to point
      at the times of Manasseh, who shed so much innocent blood, as to fill
      Jerusalem with it from one end to the other.

      Destruction and misery are in their ways. This passage also is to be found
      in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007">Isa 59:7</a>, and may be
      understood either actively thus: all the ways they take, and methods they
      pursue, are to make their fellow creatures miserable, to ruin and destroy
      them; or passively, that by their sinful ways and vicious course of life,
      they themselves are brought to destruction and misery: the way they are
      walking in is, "the broad way, that leadeth to destruction",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#013">Mat 7:13</a>; the end of it,
      what it issues in, is eternal death, the destruction of the body and soul
      in hell, which will be attended with endless and inexpressible misery.

      And the way of peace have they not known. This is a citation front
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#008">Isa 59:8</a>, and expresses the
      ignorance of mankind, with regard to true peace, and the way unto it: men
      are naturally ignorant of the way of peace with God; of the first step
      which God took towards it; of the council and covenant of peace, in which
      the scheme of it was drawn, and the method fixed; of Christ the
      peacemaker, and of the way in which he has made it; and of the Gospel,
      which reveals and publishes it. They are ignorant of the true way of
      enjoying peace of conscience; they have no true peace of mind, their
      consciences are often tortured; and though they may have a stupid and
      secure peace, yet nothing that is true, real, and solid; for they are
      without the Spirit, whose fruit is peace; and without faith in Christ, by
      which true peace only is enjoyed; nor are they spiritually minded, which
      is life and peace; nor have they any knowledge of the way to have it; they
      are ready to think it must be had by doing something of their own, and not
      that it is to be had only in Christ, in his blood and righteousness. They
      are ignorant of the paths of wisdom, which are peace; peace is enjoyed in
      them, they lead unto it, and issue in it: they know not the way to eternal
      peace; they imagine something done by the creature is the way; and are
      ignorant that Christ is the only way of salvation, the true way to eternal
      life, everlasting peace and happiness: yea, they know not the way of peace
      among men, and one another; nor will they do that which is just and right,
      in order to support and maintain it, but are unjust, deceitful, and
      quarrelsome; they do not study peace, but rather contention, which they
      like and approve of. The Jews talk (x) much of their good nature,
      affability, and condescension, and of their doing this and that, and the
      other thing, , "because of the ways of peace".

        God", is not meant a fear of God's wrath, of hell and damnation; nor a
        fearful distrust of his presence, power, providence, and grace; much
        less an hypocritical fear; but a reverential affection for God, and
        which is peculiar to the children of God, which springs from a sense of
        divine goodness, is attended with holiness of heart and life, is
        consistent with faith, even full assurance of it, and with spiritual joy
        in its highest degree; it stands opposed to pride and haughtiness, and
        is a blessing of the covenant of grace: now this is not to be found in
        unregenerate men, for this springs from grace, and not nature, and is
        only implanted in the heart in conversion; it appears from the whole
        life and conversation of unconverted men, that the fear of God is not in
        their hearts, nor before their eyes.
