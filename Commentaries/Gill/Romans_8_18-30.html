      For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time,.... By "this
      present time" may be meant, the then present age, in which the apostle
      lived; which was an age in which the people of God suffered much, as was
      foretold by Christ, and which was necessary for the confirmation of the
      Gospel; for grace and strength answerable to their trials were given them;
      and the power of God was visibly to be seen in the supporting of them;
      though this was not the only suffering age: wherefore by the present time
      may be understood, the present time of life here on earth; which is a time
      of suffering, and which cannot well be otherwise, considering the world in
      which we are, and the nature of it, the state and condition of our souls,
      and the constitution of our bodies, and the many enemies we have about us;
      but then this present time of life is the only suffering time to the
      saints, for no sooner are they removed from hence, but they are in heaven,
      where neither wicked men nor devils can reach them, where their souls are
      freed from sin and unbelief, from doubts and fears, and everything that is
      distressing; and after the resurrection there will be no more diseases nor
      death in their bodies; and this present time is but a short time, a little
      while, and all sufferings will be at an end; wherefore they
      <p></p>
      <p>
        are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in
        us. The future happiness of the saints is expressed by glory, of which
        the glory of this world is but a faint resemblance; a glory which is
        already given to Christ, and he is entered into the possession of; it is
        already, but as yet it is unseen, but will be "revealed" hereafter, when
        Christ himself shall appear in it; and it will not only be revealed to
        the saints, as the glory of Christ, as Mediator; and it will not only be
        visible upon them, upon their bodies, which will be made like to the
        glorious body of Christ; but it will be revealed in them, and greatly
        lie in the perfection of knowledge and holiness in their souls: now
        between the sufferings of the saints in the present state of things and
        their future happiness, is no comparison, either with respect to quality
        or quantity. Their afflictions are "light" in comparison of the due
        desert of sin, the sufferings of Christ, and the torments of the damaged
        in hell, and when under divine supports; but glory is heavy, it is a
        "weight of glory". The sufferings of the saints are but for a time, but
        their glory is eternal; nor is there any comparison to be made between
        them by way of merit, for there is no manner of proportion between the
        one and the other, nor can the one have any causal influence upon the
        other. This is the judgment of things the apostle made, "I reckon" or "I
        think" which is said, not as his bare opinion, or as in the least
        doubting the truth of what he said; but having deliberately weighed
        things in his mind, and reasoned upon them, came to this conclusion,
        that so it must be. The allusion is either to logicians, who having
        settled the premises draw the conclusion; or to arithmeticians, who,
        having cast up the account, give the sum total. Though, after all, the
        "glory" here spoken of may mean the glorious Gospel of Christ, which was
        more and more to be revealed in the Gentile world, "in" or "by us" the
        apostles, in comparison of which all their sufferings were as nothing.

      For the earnest expectation of the creature,.... Some by the creature
      understand the universe, all created beings animate and inanimate, which
      having suffered much by the sin of man, are introduced by a rhetorical
      figure, as waiting for deliverance and a restoration to their paradisiacal
      estate; but some part of the world is manifestly distinguished from them (Rom 8:23) others think that
      angels are here meant, who being obliged to minister to sinful men, are
      represented as groaning and longing for the time when all the children of
      God shall be brought in, that they may be dismissed from their service;
      but what is said of subjection to vanity, of the bondage of corruption,
      and of their groaning and travailing in pain, can never agree with such
      happy spirits: others suppose that men in general are designed, being by
      sin brought into a state of bondage and corruption, subjected to vanity,
      attended with troubles, and liable to death, and so groan under their
      present miseries for deliverance; but to desire anything of a spiritual
      nature cannot be ascribed to men in general; and besides, as before
      observed, some persons are distinguished from them (Rom 8:23) others have been
      of opinion, that the new creature, or renewed persons, are here intended,
      who being burdened with indwelling sin, groan under it, long for
      deliverance from it, and are waiting for the heavenly glory; but these
      cannot be said to be in a state of bondage to corruption, for they are
      freed from the dominion of sin, and are become the servants of
      righteousness. It is best of all by "the creature" to understand the
      Gentile world. "The creature" here, and "the whole creation" (Rom 8:22) must be the same;
      now the phrase , "the whole creation", or "every creature", as it may be
      rendered, signifies the nations of the world, in distinction to the Jews;
      see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015">Mar 16:15</a>; compared with
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#019">Mat 28:19</a> and answers to
      "the creatures"; by which name the Jews often in their writings call the
      Gentiles, to distinguish them from the Israelites. Take two or three
      instances, as follow,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "let your commerce (say they (g)), &amp;c. be in a peaceable manner, ,
        "with the creatures"; what do "the creatures" say concerning him? such
        an one, blessed be his father who taught him the law, blessed be his
        master who taught him the law; woe , "to the creatures", because they
        learn not the law; such an one who hath learned the law, they observe
        how beautiful are his ways, and how well ordered his works; of him it is
        written, saying, "and said unto me, thou art my servant, O Israel, in
        whom I will be glorified",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#003">Isa 49:3</a>;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        where the creatures and the Israelites are evidently distinguished from
        one another: again (h),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "woe , "to the creatures", who know not, nor have they any regard for
        the service of their Creator; for it is a tradition, (says R. Isaac,)
        that "Bath Kol", or a voice, goes out every day from Mount Horeb, and
        says, woe , "to the creatures", because of the service of their
        Creator.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And a little after,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "if "the creatures", knew the love with which the holy blessed God loves
        Israel, they would roar like young lions to follow after him.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Once more (i),</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "all the prayer , "of the creatures", is only for the earth; Lord let
        the earth be fruitful, Lord let the earth prosper; all the prayer , "of
        the Israelites", is only for the house of the Lord, Lord let the house
        of the sanctuary be built.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Now what "the creature", the Gentile world, is represented as earnestly
        waiting, and wistly looking out for, is
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the manifestation of the sons of God; which is made first at their
        conversion, and afterwards openly and more fully at the appearance of
        Christ in the resurrection morn. There is a manifestation of the sons of
        God, at conversion. They that are the sons of God, are his sons before
        by divine predestination, and through the covenant of grace; as such
        they were given to Christ; and under this character, and as standing in
        this relation, he assumed their nature, and died for them, in order to
        gather them together; and indeed, this previous relation is the ground
        and foundation of the Spirit of Christ being sent down into their
        hearts, to manifest their adoption to them; for before conversion, it is
        not manifested, neither to themselves nor others, but then it is in some
        measure made known. This may in a particular manner be applied to the
        Gentiles, and God's elect among them. They were the sons of God before
        they were manifested as such; they are spoken of in prophecy as in that
        relation; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#011">Isa 45:11</a>;
        and seemed to be designed chiefly, if not altogether, by "the children
        of God scattered abroad", in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051">Joh 11:51</a>. These were not
        known, nor looked upon by the Jews, to be the children of God; but when
        the Gospel came in among them, as the power of God, it manifested them
        to be such: so that where it was formerly said, "ye are not my people",
        there it is said, "ye are the sons of the living God",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#010">Hos 1:10</a>. But the full
        manifestation of the sons of God will be in their glorification at
        Christ's second coming; when they shall be openly taken into God's
        family, and shall be owned by Christ in this relation, before angels and
        men; they will appear in themselves otherwise than now they do; they
        will be put into the possession of the inheritance they are adopted to,
        and will have that honour and dignity which belong to their character
        actually conferred on them; so that they shall appear, not only to
        themselves, but to all the world, to be what they are: now this, in the
        whole compass of it, the Gentiles might be said to be in earnest
        expectation of, and waiting for. They may be said, in some sense, to
        expect and wait for the manifestation of the Son of God himself, the
        Messiah, who is called "the desire of all nations" (Hag 2:7) for it was
        promised, that "to him should the gathering" (Gen 49:10) or, as some
        read it, "the expectation of the people", or "nations be": they also
        waited for his law, his doctrine, the everlasting Gospel (Isa 42:4) and when that
        was come among them, and became the power of God to the salvation of
        many of them, this raised in them an earnest expectation of many, of
        multitudes of the sons of God being manifested among them, according to
        several prophecies of the Old Testament, which largely speak of this
        matter; and they continue to wait for the bringing in of the fulness of
        them in the latter day, and for the ultimate glory, which all the sons
        of God, whether Jews or Gentiles, shall enjoy together.

      For the creature was made subject to vanity,.... This designs the vanity
      and emptiness of the minds of the Gentiles, who were without God and
      Christ, and the Holy Spirit, without the law and Gospel, and grace of God;
      also the vain conceits they had of themselves, of their wisdom, knowledge,
      learning, and eloquence; likewise their vain philosophy, particularly
      their gross idolatry, their polytheism, or worshipping of many gods;
      together with their divers lusts and vices, to which they were addicted,
      to such a degree, that they might be truly said to be made subject
      thereunto, being under the government of these things, slaves unto them,
      and in such subjection, as that they could not deliver themselves from it;
      though it is said,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.
        Though they were willingly vain, yet they were not willingly made
        subject to vanity; they willingly went into idolatrous and other evil
        practices, but the devil made them subject, or slaves unto them; he led
        them captive at his will, and powerfully worked in them, by divine
        permission, so that they became vassals to him, and to their lusts; for
        he seems to be designed, "by him who hath subjected the same", and not
        Adam, by whom sin entered into the world.

      </p>
      Because the creature itself also,.... The phrase in hope, which stands in
      our version, at the end of the preceding verse, should be placed in the
      beginning of this, and be read in connection with
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019">Rom 8:19</a> being a
      parenthesis, thus: "the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for
      the manifestation of the sons of God, in hope that the creature itself
      also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption"; and so it is
      placed in some copies, and in the Syriac version: that is, "the Gentiles"
      earnestly wait and expect a larger number of converts among them, in hopes
      that ere long the whole Gentile world will be freed from
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the bondage of corruption, under which it at present groaned; by which
        is meant, the bondage they were in, not only to their sinful lusts, but
        to Satan the god of this world; and particularly to their idols, by
        which they corrupted themselves, and to which they were enslaved: they
        hope for a deliverance from hence,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        into the glorious liberty of the children of God; which designs either
        the liberty of grace the children of God have here; and which consists
        in a freedom from the dominion of sin and Satan, from the law and
        bondage of it, in the free use of Gospel ordinances, in liberty of
        access to God, and a freedom from the fear of death, and a glorious
        liberty it is; or the liberty of glory the saints shall enjoy in the
        other world, which will lies in a freedom from the prison of the flesh,
        from the body of sin and death, from all sorrows and afflictions, from
        all reproaches and persecutions, from the temptations of Satan, from
        doubts, fears, and unbelief, and in the full vision of God through
        Christ, and in a free conversation with angels and saints.

      For we know that the whole creation groaneth,.... As a woman with child,
      ready to bring forth: for it is added,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and travaileth in pain together until now; regeneration is owing to the
        grace of God, which is compared to "seed", of which men are born again;
        the means of conveying it is the Gospel, and ministers are the
        instruments of begetting souls to Christ, and who travail in birth till
        Christ be formed in them: now the Gospel being carried by the apostles
        into the Gentile world, and being succeeded there, it was like a woman
        big with child, ready to bring forth many sons to God; for as it was
        prophesied, so it came to pass, that "more are the children of the
        desolate, than the children of the married wife",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001">Isa 54:1</a>; and these births
        were attended with pain. The apostles preached the word with much
        contention, and the Gentiles received it in much affliction, though with
        the joy of the Holy Ghost; as a woman rejoices when a man child is
        brought forth, though the birth has been attended with pain and labour.
        This was an united groan, and travail of all the converted Gentiles in
        the several parts of the world, together with the ministers of the
        Gospel, earnestly desiring more instances of conversion among them; and
        this vehement desire had appeared "until now", from the first time of
        the preaching of the Gospel among the Gentiles, to the writing of this
        epistle; and supposes, that though there were many spiritual births,
        there were more to come; as there has been, and will be more abundantly,
        in the latter day: and moreover, this painful labour, and these united
        groans for spiritual births, the apostles were well acquainted with, and
        therefore could say, "we know", &amp;c. by their preaching among them,
        in whom they could easily observe, and do in their writings take notice,
        how eagerly desirous they were of having the Gospel preached unto them.

      And not only they, but ourselves also,.... Not only they Gentiles, but we
      Jews likewise:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which have the firstfruits of the Spirit: meaning either the apostles,
        who were all Jews, and who most of them received the extraordinary gifts
        of the Spirit on the day of "Pentecost", which was the day of the
        firstfruits,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num028.htm#026">Num 28:26</a>; and to which
        there seems to be an allusion here; or else the Jewish converts in
        general: to the Jews the promises of the Messiah were made; to them he
        first came; the Gospel was first preached unto them, and some of them
        first believed in Christ; they had the grace of God communicated to them
        in conversion, which they received as the firstfruits, with respect to
        an after increase; or in regard to glory, like the firstfruits, grace is
        of the same kind with glory, and is a pledge and earnest of it; saints
        judge by grace the firstfruits, what glory is, and therefore long after
        it; now of these persons thus described it is said,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        even we ourselves groan within ourselves; their groans were inward from
        their hearts, not hypocritical or were among themselves, common to them
        all; and that not merely on their own account, the corruptions of their
        hearts, the sufferings they endured for the sake of the Gospel, and in a
        longing expectation for the heavenly glory, but also for the conversion
        of the Gentiles, for which they incessantly laboured, and prayed night
        and day;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. Adoption
        is explained by the redemption of the body; and by the one may be known
        what the other means: by "the redemption of our body" is not meant the
        redemption of God's elect, body and soul, by the blood and death of
        Christ, which was already finished; and which the saints, who had
        received the firstfruits, were partakers of in themselves, and therefore
        could not be said to be waiting for it: but it designs either the
        redemption of the natural body, by the resurrection from the dead; when
        the bodies of the saints will be delivered from that mortality,
        corruption, weakness, and dishonour, under which they lie in the grave;
        when they will be refined and spiritualized, and freed from everything
        which makes them an incumbrance, and an uneasiness to their souls or
        spirits now; or else the redemption of the mystical body the church, of
        which the Gentiles make a considerable part, and is to be understood of
        a deliverance of the church, from the distresses and persecutions it
        then laboured under; or rather of a making up of the body, the church,
        by a redemption or deliverance of that part of it, which lay among the
        Gentiles, from that vanity and bondage of corruption, to which it was
        subject, into the manifestation and glorious liberty of the sons of God:
        and then by "adoption" is meant, the special grace of adoption,
        manifested to the Gentiles in their effectual calling; which the Jews
        who had received the firstfruits of the Spirit were waiting for, and had
        good reason to expect, from many prophecies in the writings of the Old
        Testament; and to which they were the more encouraged, by many
        appearances of the grace and power of God, attending the ministry of the
        Gospel among them; and which adoption will be more fully manifested in
        the resurrection morn; wherefore also the inheritance, which the whole
        mystical body the church will then enter upon the possession of, may
        well be called "the adoption", because the saints are adopted to it;
        adoption gives them the title to it, none but adopted ones will enjoy
        it; and their enjoyment of it will be the full manifestation and
        completion of the grace of adoption; this saints are waiting for, both
        for themselves and others, and it is worth waiting for; for it is "an
        inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, which fades not away, reserved in
        the heavens" (Pe1 1:4) and there is good
        ground to wait for it; it is a bequest of their heavenly Father, who has
        adopted them; it is a gift of his free grace; it is already in the hands
        of Christ, with whom they are co-heirs; and they have already the
        Spirit, as the earnest of it.

      For we are saved by hope,.... We who have received the firstfruits, who
      were in a lost perishing condition, and by nature no better than others,
      than the Gentiles, are saved by sin and wrath to come by Christ, with a
      spiritual and everlasting salvation. They were already saved in the
      preparations and purposes of God; in the covenant of grace; in the arms
      and hands of Christ, through his purchase; and as considered in him; and
      with respect to the inchoation and application of salvation, in effectual
      calling, and their right unto it by the righteousness of Christ; and with
      regard to the certainty of it, in faith and hope: the manner in which they
      are said to be saved, is "by", or "in hope"; not that hope is the cause of
      salvation, but the means by which souls are brought to the enjoyment of
      it; salvation, or glory, is the object of it:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but hope that is seen, is not hope; for what a man seeth why doth he yet
        hope for? in the former clause, "hope" signifies the grace itself, but
        here the object of it; which is represented as unseen, not yet fully
        enjoyed, something future, and to be hoped for; as the resurrection of
        the dead, which is the object of hope, and is unseen, and even
        incredible to carnal reason, and is to come, and good foundation there
        is in divine revelation, to hope for it; and the hope of it is of great
        use to the saints, whilst in this world of trouble: eternal glory and
        happiness is also the object of the hope of believers; it is said to be
        the hope of their calling, which they are called by grace to; the hope
        of righteousness, which the righteousness of Christ is the ground and
        foundation of; and that blessed hope, the sum of their happiness; and
        hope laid up for them in heaven, where it is safe and secure; all which
        is unseen, and yet to come; but good reason there is to hope for it,
        since the Scriptures of truth so clearly express it; and the person,
        blood, and righteousness of Christ, lay such a solid foundation for hope
        of it: the Alexandrian copy reads, "why doth he yet wait for?" and so
        the Ethiopic version, with which agrees the Syriac version, reading the
        whole, "for if we see it, why should we wait for it?"

      But if we hope for that we see not,.... Whether it be the hour of death,
      or the second coming of Christ, or the resurrection of the dead, and
      eternal glory; all which are unseen by us, and to be hoped for:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        then do we with patience wait for it; as that which is certain and real,
        as something valuable, which will be satisfying, and be received with
        the utmost joy. This supposes, that the persons who wait for it believe
        it, and their interest in it, at least hope they have one; that they
        have a valuable esteem and affection for it; that they are not in a
        state of perfection and happiness; and that they sit loose by the things
        of this world, and are ready to part with the one, and grasp the other:
        the manner of their waiting is "with patience"; a grace, of which God is
        the efficient, Christ is the exemplar, and the word the means; and which
        is of great use under afflictions from the hand of God, under the
        reproaches and persecutions of men, under desertions and want of answers
        in prayer, under the temptations of Satan, and in the expectation of the
        heavenly glory.

      Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities,.... The Spirit of God
      which dwells in us, by whom we are led, who is the spirit of adoption to
      us, who has witnessed to our spirits, that we are the children of God,
      whose firstfruits we have received, over and above, and besides what he
      has done for us, "also helpeth our infirmities"; whilst we are groaning
      within ourselves, both for ourselves and for others, and are waiting
      patiently for what we are hoping for. The people of God, all of them, more
      or less, have their infirmities in this life. They are not indeed weak and
      infirm, in such sense as unregenerate persons are, who have no spiritual
      strength, are ignorant of their weakness, do not go to Christ for
      strength, nor derive any from him, and hence can perform nothing that is
      spiritually good: nor are they all alike infirm; some are weaker in faith,
      knowledge, and experience, than others; some are of more weak and
      scrupulous consciences than others be: some are more easily drawn aside
      through corruption and temptation than others are; some have weaker gifts,
      particularly in prayer, than others have, yet all have their infirmities;
      not only bodily afflictions, persecutions of men, and temptations of
      Satan, but internal corruptions, and weakness to oppose them, and to
      discharge their duty to God and man; and also have their infirmities in
      the exercise of grace, and in the performance of the work of prayer;
      though they are not left to sink under them, but are helped by "the
      Spirit": by whom is meant, not any tutelar angel, or the human soul, or
      the gift of the Spirit in prayer, but the Holy Spirit of God himself; who,
      as the word here used signifies, "helps together", with hope and patience,
      graces which he has implanted, and which he invigorates and draws forth
      into act and exercise; or with the saints labouring under their burdens;
      or with the Father and the Son, who also are helpers of the saints: and
      this helping of them implies, that their infirmities and burdens are such
      as they must sink under, unless they are helped; and which is done by the
      Spirit, by bringing to remembrance, and applying the precious promises of
      the Gospel, by shedding abroad the love of God in their hearts, by acting
      the part of a comforter to them, by putting strength into them, and by
      assisting them in prayer to God:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for we know not what we should pray for as we ought. The children of God
        are not ignorant of the object of prayer, that it is God, and not a
        creature, God, as the God of nature, providence, and grace, God in the
        persons of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, and with a
        view to his glorious perfections: nor of the way of coming to God in
        prayer, through Christ; nor of the manner of performing it in faith,
        with fervency, sincerity, reverence, humility, and submission; nor who
        they should pray for, for themselves, for all men, even enemies,
        particularly for the saints, and ministers of the Gospel; nor of many
        other things respecting prayer, as that it is both their duty and
        privilege; their own inability, and the need of the assistance of the
        Spirit in it; but what they are ignorant of is chiefly the matter of
        prayer: indeed the whole Bible is an instruction in general to this
        work, so is the prayer Christ taught his disciples, and the several
        prayers of saints recorded in the Scriptures; the promises of God, and
        their own wants and necessities, may, and do, greatly direct them; as
        for instance, when under a sense of sin, to pray for a discovery of
        pardoning grace; when under darkness and desertions, for the light of
        God's countenance; when under a sense of weakness of grace, and the
        strength of corruptions, for fresh supplies of grace and strength, for
        communion with God in ordinances, for more grace here, and glory
        hereafter; but what of all things they seem to be, at least at some
        times, at a loss about, is what to pray for with respect to things
        temporal, such as riches, honour, friends, &amp;c. to have present
        afflictions removed, or temptations cease; and too often it is, that
        they pray with greater importunity for lesser things, than for things of
        more importance; and more from an intemperate zeal, and with a view to
        self, than for the glory of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but the Spirit itself maketh intercession, for us, with groanings which
        cannot be uttered; not the spirit of a man; or the gift of the Spirit in
        man; or a man endued with an extraordinary gift of the Spirit; but the
        Holy Ghost himself, who makes intercession for the saints: not in such
        sense as Christ does; for he intercedes not with the Father, but with
        them, with their spirits; not in heaven, but in their hearts; and not
        for sinners, but for saints: nor in the manner as Christ does, not by
        vocal prayer, as he when on earth; nor by being the medium, or way of
        access to God; nor by presenting the prayers of saints, and the blood
        and sacrifice of Christ to God, as Christ does in heaven; nor as the
        saints make intercession for one another, and for other persons: but he
        intercedes for them, by making them to intercede; he indites their
        prayers for them, not in a book, but in their hearts; he shows them
        their need, what their wants are; he stirs them up to prayer, he
        supplies them with arguments, puts words into their mouths, enlarges
        their hearts, gives strength of faith in prayer, and all the ardour and
        fervency of it; he enables them to come to God as their Father; and
        gives them liberty and boldness in his presence, which requires an heart
        sprinkled from an evil conscience, faith in the blood and righteousness
        of Christ, and a view of God, as a God of peace, grace, and mercy: and
        this intercession he makes, "with groanings which, cannot be uttered";
        not that the Spirit of God groans, but he stirs up groans in the saints;
        which suppose a burden on them, and their sense of it: and these are
        said to be "unutterable"; saints, under his influence, praying silently,
        without a voice, as Moses and Hannah did (Sa1 1:13) and yet most
        ardently and fervently; or as not being able to express fully what they
        conceive in their minds, how great their burdens are, and their sense of
        their wants.

      And he that searcheth the hearts,.... This is peculiar to God, and a
      "periphrasis" of him; angels, neither good nor bad, can search into the
      hearts of men; one man cannot know the heart of another, nor any man fully
      know his own; this is the prerogative of God: and
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit; not the spirit of men, but of
        God: that affectionate desire and meaning of the Spirit of God, in the
        unalterable groans of the saints; he knows the wise meaning there is in
        them, for so may signify, and is opposed to the carnal mind, or wisdom
        of the flesh, which desires foolish things. The searcher of hearts knows
        this, not barely by his omniscience, but he regards it, approves of it,
        attends, and gives an answer to it; which is no small encouragement to
        pray, though it be but with sighs and groans unutterable; since the
        omniscient God understands, and respects such kind of prayer: and the
        reason is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>because he, the Spirit of God,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God; the
        persons for whom he intercedes are saints: to whom Christ is made
        sanctification; who are called to be saints; are sanctified by the
        Spirit of God, and walk after him: now such are the objects of God's
        delight, they are chosen by him, preserved in Christ, and have his
        righteousness imputed to them; to these he has made known his Gospel,
        has given his grace, and will at last the inheritance; so that
        intercession made for such will certainly be regarded: it may be
        rendered, "he maketh intercession for holy things according to God"; for
        spiritual blessings, divine favours, things that belong to God; or
        divine things, which are agreeably to his nature and will: and since it
        is the Holy Spirit that makes intercession, and the persons are holy for
        whom he makes it, and this is made for holy things, and all according to
        the will of God, which the Spirit of God must fully know, saints may be
        confident of the prevalence and success of such intercession.

      And we know that all things work together for good,.... There is a
      temporal good, and a spiritual good, and an eternal one. Temporal good is
      what the men of the world are seeking after, and generally have the
      greatest share of, and the saints the least; and yet they have as much as
      is needful for them, and what they have, they have with a blessing; and
      even sometimes afflictions work for the temporal good of God's children:
      spiritual good lies in a lively exercise of grace and a conformity of the
      soul to God; and is what the men of the world least regard, and the saints
      most; and sometimes afflictions issue in this sort of good, as they do
      also in eternal good, for they work for us an exceeding weight of glory:
      by "all things" may be meant, all beings good and bad: all good beings
      eternal or created: eternal, as Jehovah the Father, all his perfections,
      purposes, promises, provisions, and performances; Jehovah the Son, as the
      mighty God, and as Mediator, all that he is in himself, all that he has in
      himself, all that he has done, or is doing, all his titles, characters,
      and relations; Jehovah the Spirit, in his person, offices, and operations;
      these all have worked together in the council of peace, in the covenant of
      grace, and in redemption; and they do work together in sanctification, and
      so they will in glorification, and that for the good of the saints: all
      created ones, as good angels, good magistrates, good ministers of the
      Gospel: all evil beings, as devils, persecuting magistrates, heretics, and
      false teachers: all things, good and bad: all good things, outward peace
      and prosperity, external gifts, the ministry of the word, the
      administration of ordinances, church censures, admonitions, and
      excommunications; all evil things, sin the evil of evils: original sin, or
      the fall of Adam, which contains all other sins in it, was attended with
      aggravating circumstances, and followed with dismal consequences, yet has
      been overruled for good; hereby a Saviour became necessary, who was sent,
      came, and wrought out salvation; has brought in a better righteousness
      than Adam lost; entitled his people to a better life than his was, and
      makes them partakers of the riches both of grace and glory: actual sin,
      inward or outward; indwelling sin; which is made use of, when discovered,
      to abate pride, to lead to an entire dependence on Christ, to teach saints
      to be less censorious, to depend on the power and grace of God to keep
      them, and to wean them from this world, and to make them desirous of
      another, where they shall be free from it; outward sins, of others, or
      their own; the sins of others, of wicked men, which observed, raise an
      indignation in the saints against sin, and a concern for God's glory, and
      to look into their own hearts and ways, and admire the grace of God to
      them, that this is not their case; of good men, which are recorded, and
      may be observed, not for example and encouragement in sin, but for
      admonition, and to encourage faith and hope under a sense of it; of their
      own, for humiliation, which issues in weakening the power of sin in
      themselves, and the strengthening of the graces of others: but from all
      this it does not follow, that God is the author of sin, only that he
      overrules it to wise and gracious purposes; nor should any take
      encouragement to sin, to do evil that good may come; nor is sin itself a
      real good; nor is it to be said that it does no hurt; for though it cannot
      hinder the everlasting salvation of God's people, it does a great deal of
      hurt to their peace and comfort; and that it is made to work in any form
      or shape for good, is not owing to its own nature and influence, which is
      malignant enough, but to the unbounded power and unsearchable wisdom of
      God: all evils or afflictions, spiritual and temporal, work together for
      good; all spiritual ones, such as the temptations of Satan, which are made
      useful for humiliation, for the trial of grace, to show us our weakness,
      our need of Christ, and to conform us to him, and also to excite to prayer
      and watchfulness; the hidings of God's face, which make his presence the
      more prized when enjoyed, and the more desirable. Temporal afflictions,
      afflictions in body, name, or estate, nay even death itself, all work
      together for the good of God's people. The Jews tell us of one Nahum, the
      man Gamzu, who, they say, was (k) so called, because of everything that
      happened to him he used to say, , "Gam zu letobah", "this is also for
      good": and they give instances of several misfortunes which befell him,
      upon which account he used these words, and how they proved in the issue
      to his advantage: agreeably to this is the advice given by them,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "for ever (say they (l)) let a man be used to say, all that the Lord
        does, , "he does for good".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Now that all things do work together for good, the saints "know", and
        are firmly persuaded of; both from the word and promises of God, and
        from the instances of Jacob, Joseph, Job, and others, and also from
        their own experience: and it is to be observed, that it is not said that
        all things "have" worked together, and so they may again, or that they
        "shall" work together, but all things work together for good; they "now"
        work together, they are always working together, whether it can be
        observed or not: prosperity and adversity, whether in things temporal or
        spiritual, work "together", and make an intricate woven work in
        providence and grace; which will be viewed with admiration another day:
        one copy reads, "God works together", or "causes all things to work
        together for good"; and so the Ethiopic version, "we know that God helps
        them that love him, to every good thing": and to this agrees the Syriac
        version, "we know that to them that love God, he in everything helps
        them to good"; and certain it is, that God is the efficient cause, that
        makes all things work together for his people's good. The persons to
        whom all things work together for good, are described as such
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that love God; a character, which does not agree with all the sons and
        daughters of Adam: love to God is not naturally in men; it is wrought in
        the soul in regeneration, and is an evidence of it; it grows up with
        faith, which works by it; without it, a profession of religion is vain;
        and where it is once wrought, it lasts for ever; it ought to be
        superlative and universal, constant, warm and ardent, hearty and
        sincere: such who have it, show it by a desire to be like to God, and
        therefore imitate him, by making his glory the supreme end of their
        actions; by being careful not to offend him; by delighting in his
        presence, in his people, word, ordinances, ways, and worship; and by
        undervaluing the world, and all things in it, in comparison of him; who
        is to be loved for the perfections of his being, the characters and
        relations he stands in and bears to his people, and on account of the
        love with which he has loved them, and which is indeed the spring and
        source of theirs. They are further described, as such
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who are the called according to his purpose. The called of God and of
        Jesus Christ; not to any office, or by the external ministry of the word
        only, but by special grace; from darkness to light, from bondage to
        liberty, from the company of sinful men to fellowship with Christ, from
        a trust in their own righteousness to a dependence on his, to grace
        here, and glory hereafter; which is done according to the purpose of
        God: the persons called are fixed upon by God; none are called but whom
        God purposed to call; those who are called can assign no other reason of
        it than the will of God; and no other reason but that can be given why
        others are not called; the time when, the place where, the means whereby
        persons are called, are all settled and determined by the will, and
        according to the purpose of God.

      For whom he did foreknow,.... The foreknowledge of God here, does not
      intend his prescience of all things future; by which he foreknows and
      foretells things to come, and which distinguishes him from all other gods;
      and is so called, not with respect to himself, with whom all things are
      present, but with respect to us, and which is eternal, universal, certain,
      and infallible; for in this sense he foreknows all men, and if this was
      the meaning here, then all men would be predestinated, conformed to the
      image of Christ, called by grace, justified and glorified; whereas they
      are a special people, whom God has foreknown: nor is this foreknowledge to
      be understood of any provision or foresight of the good works, holiness,
      faith, and perseverance of men therein, upon which God predestinates them
      to happiness; since this would make something out of God, and not his good
      pleasure, the cause of predestination; which was done before, and without
      any consideration of good or evil, and is entirely owing to the free grace
      of God, and is the ground and foundation of good works, faith, holiness,
      and perseverance in them: but this regards the everlasting love of God to
      his own people, his delight in them, and approbation of them; in this
      sense he knew them, he foreknew them from everlasting, affectionately
      loved them, and took infinite delight and pleasure in them; and this is
      the foundation of their predestination and election, of their conformity
      to Christ, of their calling, justification, and glorification: for these
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; having
        perfect, distinct, special knowledge of them, joined with love to them,
        he predetermined, or fore-appointed them in his eternal mind, in his
        everlasting and unchangeable purposes and decrees to this end,
        conformity to the image of Christ; which is not to be understood of the
        Spirit of Christ: God's elect indeed are chosen to be holy, and through
        sanctification of the Spirit, but are never said to be conformed, made
        like to the Spirit, nor is the Spirit ever called the image of Christ;
        but this designs either likeness to Christ as the Son of God, or
        conformity to him in his human nature. There is indeed a great disparity
        between the sonship of Christ, and of the saints; he is the eternal and
        natural Son of God, he is the one and only begotten Son, they are
        adopted ones, yet in some things there is a likeness; as he is the Son
        of God, so are they the sons of God, though not in the same sense; as he
        is a beloved Son, so are they; as he is the firstborn with respect them,
        they are the firstborn with respect to angels; as he has an inheritance,
        so have they; moreover, he has a very great concern in their sonship;
        the predestination of them to it is by him; the blessing itself is
        founded on union to him, on their conjugal relation to him, and his
        assumption of their nature; it comes to them through his redemption, and
        is actually bestowed on them by him; and this conformity to Christ as
        sons, will mere fully appear hereafter, when they shall be like him, and
        see him as he is: or this may be understood of the saints' conformity to
        Christ in his human nature, both here and hereafter: here in holiness;
        the image of God was in in his first creation, this is defaced by sin;
        and in regeneration, the image of Christ is stamped, his grace is
        wrought in them, his Spirit is put into them, to enable them to walk in
        him, and after him: this will be complete hereafter, and will consist in
        perfect holiness, being freed from the very being, as well as the power
        and guilt of sin; in perfect knowledge of everything that will tend to
        their happiness; and in glory like to Christ, both in soul and body:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that he might be the firstborn among many brethren; the persons among
        whom Christ is the firstborn are described by their relation,
        "brethren"; to one another, being related to the same Father,
        regenerated by the same grace, taken into the same family, and heirs of
        the same glory; and to Christ, which relation, as brethren to him, is
        not merely founded on his incarnation, but in their adoption; and which
        is evidenced by their regeneration, and doing the will of his Father; an
        which relation he owns, and is not ashamed of: they are also described
        by their number, "many"; for though they are but few, when compared with
        the world; yet they are many, a large number, considered by themselves;
        and among these, Christ is the "firstborn"; he is the firstborn of God,
        the begotten of the Father, he is the first begotten, and as such he is
        the only begotten; he is the firstborn of Mary, she had none before him,
        and he is the only one that ever was born in the manner he was; he is
        the first begotten from the dead, his resurrection is called a
        begetting, and he was the first in time that rose from the dead by his
        own power, and to an immortal life, and the first in causality and
        dignity. Christ is the firstborn with respect to all creatures in
        general; he was begotten of the Father before all creatures were; he is
        the first cause of them all, the governor, basis, and support of them:
        and he is the firstborn with respect to the saints; who are of the same
        nature with him, are made partakers of the divine nature, are sons in
        the same family, though not in the same class of sonship: moreover, this
        character may regard not so much birth as privilege which belongs to
        Christ as Mediator; who, as the firstborn had, has the blessing, the
        government, the priesthood, and the inheritance; all which is owing to,
        and is one end of divine predestination. The Cabalistic (m) writers
        among the Jews give the name of "firstborn" to the second Sephira,
        number, or person, "Wisdom", which answers to the Son of God.

      Moreover, whom he did predestinate,.... Not to sufferings, which are not
      expressed nor designed, but to grace and glory after mentioned. This
      predestination is of particular persons, who, in consequence of it, are
      called, justified, and glorified; it is the effect of divine grace, and
      entirely owing to it; it is the source of all the other blessings of
      grace, and is therefore placed at the head of them, and secures them all:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        them he also called; not to afflictions: many may be called to
        afflictions, and endure them, who are neither justified nor glorified;
        besides, the people of God, though they meet with many afflictions,
        between their call to eternal glory, and their enjoyment of it, yet they
        are not so much called to afflictions, as to patience under them: their
        call is of grace, by special grace, to peculiar blessings of grace, and
        to a kingdom and glory; and this their calling is secured by
        predestination, and connected with glorification: and whom he called,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        them he also justified; the meaning of which is, not that he approved of
        them as sincere and faithful, on account of their faith and patience in
        sufferings; for neither of their sufferings, nor of their faith and
        patience in them, is there the least mention in the passage; nor can any
        instance be produced of the use of the word "justified" in this epistle,
        or elsewhere in this sense: but the meaning is, that such persons whom
        God predestinates and calls, he makes them righteous by the imputation
        of the righteousness of his Son unto them; which is unto all, and upon
        all them that believe; by which they are justified before God, and in
        their own consciences, from all sin, and so secured from all wrath and
        condemnation; wherefore glorification stands inseparably connected with
        it:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and whom he justified, them he also glorified; which is not meant of
        being made glorious under sufferings; nor of being made glorious by the
        extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; for the word is never used in this
        sense, nor is God ever said to glorify his people in this way; and the
        apostle is speaking of the saints in general, and not of particular
        ones: if this was the sense, none would be predestinated, called, and
        justified, but such who have the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; and
        none would have the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, but such persons;
        whereas many have had these, and yet no interest in the grace of God,
        and everlasting happiness: but eternal glory is here meant, which is
        what the apostle had been speaking of in the context; is what the elect
        are predestinated and called unto; and which their justification gives
        them a right and title to; and will consist in a likeness to Christ, in
        communion with him, in an everlasting vision of him, and in a freedom
        from all that is evil, and in an enjoyment of all that is good; and so
        the great end of predestinating grace will be answered in them mentioned
        in the foregoing verse: now this glorification may be said to be already
        done, with respect to that part of God's elect, who are in heaven,
        inheriting the promises; and is in some sense true also of that part of
        them which is on earth, who are called and justified; being made
        glorious within by the grace of Christ, and arrayed and adorned with the
        glorious robe of his righteousness; by the one they have a meetness, and
        by the other a right to eternal glory; of which this grace they have
        received is the beginning, pledge, and earnest: besides, they are
        already glorified in Christ, their head and representative, and in the
        view of God, and with respect to the certainty of it, it being prepared
        and made ready for them, is in the hands of Christ for them, and is
        insured to their faith and hope. It is an observation of a Jewish writer
        (n),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that a thing , "which is decreed to be", is spoken of in the past
        tense:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        this is the Scripture style concerning things decreed, and such is the
        glorification of all God's elect.
