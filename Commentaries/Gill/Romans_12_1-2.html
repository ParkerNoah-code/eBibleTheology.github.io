      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        that ye present your bodies; not barely that part of them commonly so
        called, for this is not to be understood of a mere presentation of the
        body in public worship: for though this ought to be, yet not without the
        heart engaged therein, otherwise bodily exercise will be of no avail;
        nor of a bare abstinence from grosser sins done in the body, and against
        it, and which defile and dishonour it; much less of a maceration, and
        keeping under the body, by watchings, fasting, &amp;c. and still less of
        an offering of the body at death in a way of martyrdom, though this
        ought to be cheerfully complied with when called for: but by their
        bodies are meant, themselves, their whole souls and bodies, all the
        powers and faculties of their souls, and members of their bodies; and
        the presenting of them, designs a devoting of them, with all readiness
        and willingness, to the service of God for his honour and glory, without
        putting any confidence in, or placing any dependence upon them; which
        would be sacrificing to their own net, and burning incense to their
        drag; it includes the whole of their service, conversation, and
        religion, internal and external. So the Jews (k) say,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "worthy is the portion of the righteous, who offer every day this
        offering before the Lord; and what is it? , "their bodies and their
        souls", which they offer before him.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The allusion is to the rite of sacrificing, to the bringing of the slain
        beast, and laying it on the altar, and there presenting and offering it
        to the Lord. Under the Gospel dispensation all believers are priests;
        and the sacrifices they bring are not the bodies of slain beasts, but
        their own bodies, their whole selves; and these
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a living sacrifice, in opposition to the bodies of slain beasts offered
        under the legal dispensation, and to the dead works of such as are
        destitute of faith in Christ, and to the lifeless performances of the
        saints themselves at certain times; and designs such a presentation of
        themselves in the performance of religious duties, as springs from a
        principle of life under the quickening influences of the Spirit of God,
        with faith and fervency; though without any view to obtain life hereby,
        for that is only by the offering up of the body of Christ once for all.
        Another epithet of this sacrifice of our bodies to God is
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        holy, in allusion to the sacrifices under the law, which were separated
        from common use, and devoted to God, and were not to have the least spot
        and blemish in them; and regards men sanctified by the Spirit of God,
        and whose actions flow from a principle of holiness, and are performed
        under the influence of the Holy Spirit; and such sacrifices as are both
        living and holy, cannot but be
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        acceptable to God through the mediation of his Son, by whom, as the
        persons, the souls and bodies of his people, so their spiritual
        sacrifices, whether of prayer or praise, are only acceptable to him:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which is your reasonable service; it is agreeably to reason, and
        especially as sanctified, that men who have their beings from God, and
        are upheld in them by him, and are followed with the bounties of
        Providence; and especially who are made new creatures, and are blessed
        by him with all spiritual blessings in Christ, that they should give up
        themselves to him, and cheerfully serve him in their day and generation;
        such service is also agreeably to the Scriptures of truth, the standard
        of filth and practice, and contain and enforce nothing but what is
        highly reasonable to be complied with; it is such service as lies not in
        the slaying of irrational creatures, but in the presenting of men endued
        with rational powers unto God; and is of a spiritual nature, performed
        by spiritual men, under the influence of the Spirit of God: and is
        suitable to the nature and perfections of God, and stands opposed to the
        corporeal and carnal service of the Jews.

      And be not conformed to this world,.... By this world is meant, either the
      Mosaic dispensation, and Jewish church state, so called in opposition to ,
      "the world to come", the Gospel dispensation; in which there were a
      worldly sanctuary, and the rites and ceremonies of which are styled the
      rudiments and elements of the world; to which believers in the present
      state are by no means to conform, there being sacrifices and ordinances of
      another nature, it is the will of God they should observe and attend unto:
      or else the men of the world are designed, carnal and unregenerate men,
      among whom they formerly had their conversation, from among whom they were
      chosen, called, and separated, and who lie and live in wickedness, and
      therefore should not be conformed unto them: which is to be understood,
      not in a civil sense of conformity to them in garb and apparel, provided
      that pride and luxury are guarded against, and decency and sobriety
      observed, and the different abilities of persons and stations in life are
      attended to; or to any other civil usages and customs which are not
      contrary to natural and revealed religion; but of a conformity in a moral
      sense to the evil manners of men, to walk vainly, as other Gentiles do, to
      go into the same excess of riot with them; for this is contrary both to
      the principle and doctrine of grace, which teach men to deny ungodliness
      and worldly lusts: and of a compliance with the men of the world in a
      religious sense, by joining with them in acts of idolatry, superstition,
      and will worship, and in anything that is contrary to the order,
      ordinances, and truths of the Gospel.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind; which regards not
        the first work of conversion and renovation; for in this sense these
        persons were transformed, metamorphosed, changed, and renewed already;
        but the after progress and carrying on the work of renovation, the
        renewing of them day by day in the spirit of their minds; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#023">Eph 4:23</a>; which believers
        should be desirous of, and pray for, and make use of those means which
        the Spirit of God owns for this purpose, attending to the spiritual
        exercises of religion, as reading, meditation, prayer, conference, the
        ministration of the word and ordinances, which is the reverse of
        conformity to the world: and the end to be attained hereby is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of
        God; by which is meant not the secret will of God, which cannot be
        searched into, proved, and known, till time and facts discover it: but
        the revealed will of God, both in the law, as in the hands of Christ,
        which contains nothing but what is good; and which when done in faith,
        from a principle of love, and to the glory of God, is acceptable through
        Christ; and is perfect as a law of liberty, and rule of walk and
        conversation; and which is to be proved and approved of by all the
        saints, who delight in it after the inward man: and also that which is
        contained in the Gospel; as that all that the Father had given to Christ
        should be redeemed by him, that these should be sanctified, and
        persevere to the end, and be glorified; all which is the good will of
        God, an acceptable saying to sensible sinners, and such a scheme of
        salvation as is perfect and complete, and needs nothing to be added to
        it; and is, by such who are daily renewed in the spirit of their minds,
        more and more proved, tried, discerned, and approved of, even by all
        such who have their spiritual senses exercised to discern things that
        differ.
