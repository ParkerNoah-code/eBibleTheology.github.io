      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The apostle having, in the preceding chapters, proved that there is no
        justification before God by the works of the law, partly from the
        depraved state and condition that all men are in by nature, both Jews
        and Gentiles; and partly from the nature of the law itself, which
        discovers sin, arraigns men for it, and convicts of it, and pronounces
        guilty before God for it; as also by showing, that it is by another
        righteousness, which he describes, that men are justified in the sight
        of God; proceeds in this to confirm the same by an example; and that
        which he pitches upon is the most appropriate and pertinent he could
        have thought of, namely, that of Abraham, the father of the Jews (Rom 4:1) for in whatsoever
        way he was justified, his sons surely could not imagine but it must be
        the right way, nor should they seek another: now that Abraham was not
        justified by works, he proves
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002">Rom 4:2</a>, from an absurdity
        following upon it, that he would have just reason to glory; whereas no
        man ought to glory before God, but only in the Lord: and by a passage of
        Scripture (Rom 4:3) to
        which he appeals, he makes it clearly appear that he was justified by
        faith, for that says, his faith was counted for righteousness. This case
        of accounting anything to another for righteousness, is illustrated by
        two sorts of persons, who have different things accounted to them, and
        in a different manner; to the worker, the reward is reckoned of debt,
        and not of grace (Rom 4:4)
        but to the believer that works not, his faith, as Abraham's was, is
        counted for righteousness; whence it follows, that not the worker is
        justified by his works, but the believer by the righteousness of faith;
        and this is confirmed by a testimony of David in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001">Psa 32:1</a>, by which the
        apostle proves the imputation of righteousness without works, in which
        the happiness of men consists (Rom 4:6) and shows, that
        this happiness does not belong to circumcised persons only, but to the
        uncircumcised also; and therefore is not by circumcision, but by faith (Rom 4:9) and which he
        proves by observing the time when faith was reckoned to Abraham for
        righteousness; not when he was circumcised, but before (Rom 4:10) the use of which
        circumcision to him was to assure him, that he should be the father of
        uncircumcised Gentiles that believed, to whom righteousness should be
        imputed, as to him when he was uncircumcised (Rom 4:11) who are
        described by their imitation of his faith, which he had, and exercised
        before his circumcision,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012">Rom 4:12</a>. And this leads
        on to a fresh argument, proving justification to be by faith, and not by
        the works of the law, since the promise made to Abraham, and his seed,
        was not through the law, but the righteousness of faith; and
        consequently both his and their justification were not by the one, but
        by the other (Rom 4:13)
        or, if otherwise, both the faithfulness of God, and the faith of his
        people, would be void, and the promise of grace of no effect,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014">Rom 4:14</a>. And this is
        still further argued from the effect of the law working wrath, which, if
        justification was by it, it would never do,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015">Rom 4:15</a>. The wisdom and
        goodness of God in giving faith, and not works, a concern in
        justification, are observed (Rom 4:16) whereby it
        appears to be of free grace, faith only being a recipient, and what
        gives all the glory to God; and also the promise of eternal life through
        justification by free grace becomes sure to all the spiritual seed; who
        are distributed into two sorts, the believing Jews under the legal
        dispensation, and the believing Gentiles, under the Gospel dispensation;
        of both which Abraham was father; which is confirmed by a testimony out
        of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004">Gen 17:4</a>, whose faith
        is described by the object of it, the omnipotent God that quickens the
        dead, and calls things that are not, as though they were (Rom 4:17) and by the
        nature of it (Rom 4:18)
        believing in hope against hope, resting on the promise of God; and by
        the strength of it, being not at all weakened by considering, either his
        own case, or that of his wife's (Rom 4:19) and was so far
        from being staggered through unbelief at these things, that it was
        strong in exercise, thereby glorifying God, the object of it (Rom 4:20) nay, it rose up
        to a plerophory, a full assurance (Rom 4:21) being built upon
        the power of a promising God; hence, as before observed, his faith was
        reckoned to him for righteousness (Rom 4:22) And now in the
        same way that he was justified, all his children, his spiritual seed,
        are justified, whether they be Jews or Gentiles; for what is said
        concerning the imputation of the righteousness of faith to him, does not
        concern him only (Rom 4:23) but all true
        believers also; whose faith is described by the object of it, him that
        raised up Christ from the dead, that is, God the Father (Rom 4:24) who is supposed
        hereby to have been dead, and is represented as the Lord and Saviour of
        his people; and of whom a further account is given (Rom 4:25) as being
        delivered into the hands of men, of justice, and of death, for the sins
        of his people, which he took upon him, and bore, and made satisfaction
        for, and as being raised again for their justification; so that this is
        a benefit owing not to the works of men, but to what Christ has done and
        suffered in the room and stead of his people; which is what the apostle
        meant to bring this point unto; the blessed effects and consequences of
        which he relates in the next chapter.

      What shall we say then,.... The apostle having proved that there is no
      justification by the works of the law; to make this appear more clear and
      evident to the Jews, he instances in the greatest person of their nation,
      and for whom they had the greatest value and esteem,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Abraham, our father; who was not a righteous and good man, but the head
        of the Jewish nation; and, as the Syriac version here styles him, , "the
        head", or "chief of the fathers"; and so the Alexandrian copy, "our
        forefather": and was the first of the circumcision, and is described
        here by his relation to the Jews, "our father"; that is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as pertaining to the flesh; or according to carnal descent, or natural
        generation and relation; for in a spiritual sense, or with respect to
        faith and grace, he was the father of others, even of all that believe,
        whether Jews or Gentiles: now the question put concerning him is, "what
        he, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?" for the phrase, "as
        pertaining to the flesh", may be connected with the word
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        found; and to find anything is by seeking to obtain, and enjoy it: and
        the sense of the whole is, did he find out the way of life,
        righteousness, and salvation by the mere hint of carnal reason? and did
        he obtain these things by his own strength? or were these acquired by
        his circumcision in the flesh, or by any other fleshly privilege he
        enjoyed? or was he justified before God by any services and performances
        of his, of whatsoever kind? There is indeed no express answer returned;
        but it is evident from what follows, that the meaning of the apostle is,
        that it should be understood in the negative.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#002">Romans 4:2</a>

          ></span
        >
      </p>
      For if Abraham were justified by works,.... That Abraham was not, and
      could not be justified by works, is clear from hence, that if this was his
      case,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he hath whereof to glory; which will be allowed him before men, on
        account of his pious life and conversation:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but not before God; who saw all the iniquity of his heart, and was privy
        to all his failings and infirmities: besides, glorying before God in a
        man's own works, is contrary to the scheme and method of God's grace; is
        excluded by the doctrine of faith; nor is there any place for glorying
        before God but in Christ, and his righteousness: if therefore Abraham
        had not that of which he could glory before God, he could not be
        justified by works in his sight: but does not the Apostle James say that
        he was justified by works,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#021">Jam 2:21</a>? To this it may
        be replied, that the two apostles, Paul and James, are not speaking of
        the same thing: Paul speaks of justification before God, James of
        justification before men; Paul speaks of the justification of the
        person, James of the justification of a man's cause, as the truth of his
        faith, or the uprightness of his conduct; Paul speaks of works, as the
        causes of justification, James of them as the effects and evidences of
        faith; Paul had to do with the self-righteous, who trusted in their own
        works for justification, James with Gnostics, who slighted and neglected
        the performance of them. These things considered, they will be found to
        agree.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003">Romans 4:3</a>
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      For what saith the Scripture?.... This answers to "what is that which is
      written" (c)? or what does the Scripture say? which is a way of speaking
      used by the Jews, when anything is proposed, which seems contrary to
      Scripture, as here justification by works does. A testimony from Scripture
      is here produced, proving that Abraham was justified by faith, and not by
      works: the place referred to is
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006">Gen 15:6</a>;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Abraham believed God; the object of his faith and trust were not his
        riches, nor his righteousness, but Jehovah, the Son of God, the second
        person in the Trinity, styled in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001">Gen 15:1</a>, "the Word of the
        Lord", the essential Word of God, and called his "shield", and
        "exceeding great reward"; characters which are very applicable to
        Christ: and this faith of his in the Lord was not a mere assent to the
        promise of God, but a fiducial act of faith in him; and was not merely
        concerned with temporal, but with spiritual things, and particularly
        about Christ the promised seed:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and it was counted to him for righteousness, the meaning of which is
        not, that Abraham imputed righteousness to God, or celebrated his
        righteousness and faithfulness, as some; or that the world reckoned
        Abraham a righteous person, as others; but that God reckoned him
        righteous, or imputed it to him for righteousness: and the question is,
        what the it is which was counted to him for righteousness? and that this
        is to be understood, , "concerning faith", as R. Solomon Jarchi says, is
        out of question; for this is expressly said by the apostle,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009">Rom 4:9</a>. The only one is,
        whether it means the grace of faith by which he believed; or the object
        of faith on which he believed, and with which his faith was conversant:
        not the former, for that is not righteousness, nor accounted so; but is
        distinguished from it, and is that by which a person receives and lays
        hold on righteousness; besides, whatever may be alleged in favour of the
        imputation of Abraham's faith to himself for righteousness, it can never
        be thought to be imputed to others on that account; whereas the very
        selfsame it is imputed to others also; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#024">Rom 4:24</a>; it remains then
        that it was the promised seed, the Messiah, and his righteousness, which
        Abraham, by faith, looked unto, and believed in, that was made unto him
        righteousness by imputation. Now since so great and good a man as
        Abraham was not justified by works, but by faith in the righteousness of
        the Messiah, it follows, that none of his sons, nor any other person
        whatever, ought to seek for, or expect to be justified in any other way.

      </p>
      Now to him that worketh,.... The apostle illustrates the former case by
      two sorts of persons in this and the next verse, who have different things
      accounted to them, and in a different manner. The one is represented as
      working, the other not. By the worker is meant, not one that works from,
      and upon principles of grace. The regenerate man is disposed to work for
      God; the man that has the Spirit of God is capable of working; he that has
      the grace of Christ, and strength from him, can work well; he that
      believes in Christ, works in a right way; he that loves Christ, works
      freely, and from a right principle; and he that has Christ's glory in
      view, works to a right end: but the worker here, is one that works upon
      nature's principles, and with selfish views; one that works in the
      strength of nature, trusting to, and glorying in what he does; seeking
      righteousness by his work, and working for eternal life and salvation. Now
      let it be supposed, that such a worker not only thinks he does, but if it
      could be, really does all the works of the law, yields a perfect obedience
      to it; what
      <p></p>
      <p>is the reward that is, and will be</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        reckoned to him? There is no reward due to the creature's work, though
        ever so perfect, arising front any desert or dignity in itself: there
        may be a reward by promise and compact; God may promise a reward to
        encourage to obedience, as he does in the law, which is not eternal
        life; for that is the free gift of God, and is only brought to light in
        the Gospel; and though heaven is called a reward, yet not of man's
        obedience, but Christ's; but admitting heaven itself to be the reward
        promised to the worker, in what manner must that be reckoned to him?
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not of grace: for grace and works can never agree together; for if the
        reward is reckoned for the man's works, then it is not of grace,
        "otherwise work is no more work",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006">Rom 11:6</a>; and if it is of
        grace, then not for his works, "otherwise grace is no more grace",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#006">Rom 11:6</a>; it remains
        therefore, that if it is reckoned for his works, it must be
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        of debt: it must be his due, as wages are to an hireling. Now this was
        not Abraham's case, which must have been, had he been justified by
        works; he had a reward reckoned to him, and accounted his, which was God
        himself, "I am thy shield, and exceeding, great reward",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#001">Gen 15:1</a>; which must be
        reckoned to him, not of debt, but of grace; wherefore it follows, that
        he was justified, not by works, but by the grace of God imputed to him;
        that which his faith believed in for righteousness. The distinction of a
        reward of grace, and of debt, was known to the Jews; a the one they
        called the other the former (d) they say is "a benefit", which is freely
        of grace bestowed on an undeserving person, or one he is not obliged to;
        the other is what is given, "of debt", in strict justice.

        >
      </p>
      But to him that worketh not,.... Not that the believer does not work at
      all, but not from such principles, and with such views as the other; he
      does not work in order to obtain life and salvation; he does not seek for
      justification by his doings:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly: or that ungodly one:
        particular reference is had to Abraham, who in his state of unregeneracy
        was an ungodly person; as all God's elect are in a state of nature, and
        are such when God justifies them, being without a righteousness of their
        own; wherefore he imputes the righteousness of another, even that of his
        own Son, unto them: and though he justifies the ungodly, he does not
        justify their ungodliness, but them from it; nor will he, nor does he
        leave them to live and die in it; now to him that worketh not, that is
        perfect righteousness; or has no opportunity of working at all; or what
        he does, he does not do, that he might be justified by it; but exercises
        faith on God as justifying persons, who, like himself, are sinners,
        ungodly and destitute of a righteousness:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        his faith is counted for righteousness; not the act, but the object of
        it; which was Abraham's case, and therefore was not justified by works.
        The Vulgate Latin version here adds, "according to the purpose of the
        grace of God".

      </p>
      Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man,.... the apostle
      having instanced in Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, cites some
      passages from David, king of Israel, a person of great note and esteem
      among the Jews, in favour of the doctrine he is establishing; who in a
      very proper and lively manner describes the happiness of such persons:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works. This righteousness
        cannot be the righteousness of the law, or man's obedience to it; for
        that is a righteousness with works, is a man's own, and not imputed; and
        indeed is not a righteousness in the sight of God: nor does man's
        blessedness lie in, or come by it; no man is, or can be instilled by it,
        nor saved by it, or attain to heaven and eternal happiness by the means
        of it; but the righteousness here spoken of is the righteousness of
        Christ, called the righteousness of God; and is better than that of
        angels or men; is complete and perfect; by which the law is honoured,
        and justice is satisfied. This is freely bestowed, and graciously
        "imputed" by God. Just in the same way his righteousness becomes ours,
        as Adam's sin did, which is by imputation; or in the same way that our
        sins became Christ's, his righteousness becomes ours; and as we have no
        righteousness of our own when God justifies us, this must be done by the
        righteousness of another; and that can be done no other way by the
        righteousness of another, than by imputing it to us: and which is done
        "without works"; not without the works of Christ, of which this
        righteousness consists; but without the works of the creature, or any
        consideration of them, which are utterly excluded from justification;
        for if these came into account, it would not be of grace, and boasting
        would not be removed. Now such who have this righteousness thus imputed
        to them, are happy persons; they are justified from all sin, and freed
        from all condemnation; their persons and services are acceptable to God;
        it will be always well with them; they are heirs of glory, and shall
        enjoy it.

      Saying, blessed are they,.... These words are cited from
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#001">Psa 32:1</a>, and contain the
      proof of the happiness of justified persons. In this citation the singular
      number is changed into the plural, to take in all sorts of men, Jews and
      Gentiles, and very agreeably to the sense of the original; for the word
      may be rendered "blessed are they", or, "O the blessednesses"; that is, of
      everyone of them,

        whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered: such whom God
        justifies by imputing the righteousness of his Son to them, he removes
        their iniquities from them, which is meant by their being "forgiven",
        and that "as far as the east is from the west",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#012">Psa 103:12</a>; he casts them
        behind his back (Isa 38:17) and into the
        depths of the sea (Mic 7:19) so that they
        shall never be found more: such whom he clothes with the robe of
        righteousness, and garments of salvation (Isa 61:10) "their sins are
        covered"; from the eye of divine justice, and shall never be seen more,
        or be brought against them to their condemnation, and therefore must be
        happy persons. The (e) Jews tell us, that

        "on the day of atonement Satan comes to accuse Israel, and he
        particularizes their sins, and the holy blessed God he particularizes
        their good works, and takes a pair of balances, and puts their sins
        against their good works, and weighs the one against the other; and when
        the two scales of the balances are alike, Satan goes to bring in other
        sins to overweigh; what does the holy blessed God do? he takes the sins
        out of the scale, and hides them , "under his purple garment"; and when
        Satan comes and finds no iniquity there, as it is said "the iniquity of
        Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020">Jer 50:20</a>; and when Satan
        sees this, he says before him, Lord of the world, "thou hast taken away
        the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa085.htm#002">Psa 85:2</a>. Selah.''

        The purple garment they explain by , "his garment of mercy"; which is
        true of the mercy of God covering the sins of his people, through the
        purple blood of his Son; which is the purple covering of Christ (Sol 3:10) under which the
        saints go safe to glory, and by which blood their crimson and scarlet
        sins are blotted out, so as never to be seen more.

        Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. As he does not
        to those whom he justifies in Christ, and by his righteousness; for the
        sins of such he has imputed to his Son, as their surety; and he has bore
        them, took them away, having made full satisfaction for them; so that
        these persons will never be charged with them: they now appear before
        the throne without fault, and are blameless and irreproveable in the
        sight of God, and therefore must be eternally happy; for he will never
        think of their sins any more to their hurt; he will remember them no
        more; he "will never reckon them to them", but acquit them from them,
        justify and accept them; wherefore they must be secure from wrath and
        condemnation, enjoy much peace and comfort now, and be happy hereafter.
