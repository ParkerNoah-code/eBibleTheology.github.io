      The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. This verse is
      placed by the Syriac at the end of the chapter, and is wanting in the
      Ethiopic version, and in one ancient copy, being, excepting the word all,
      the same as at the end of
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020">Rom 16:20</a>; but inasmuch as
      it is in all other copies, it ought to be repeated and stand here: the
      reason of the repetition may either be, because the former might be
      written by his amanuensis, and this with his own hand, as was usual with
      him in all his epistles, by which they might be known to be his,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#017">Th2 3:17</a>; or the apostle
      having so great an affection for this church, knew not how to take his
      leave of them, but repeats his valediction again and again, as here, and
      in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020">Rom 16:20</a>.
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025">Rom 16:25</a> are placed in some
      copies, at the end of
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#014">Rom 16:14</a>, and omitted here,
      as they are by the Arabic version, which begins thus, "to the only most
      wise God, Jesus Christ": and so considers the following doxology as be,
      longing to Christ, and to him as God, and as the only most wise God.

      Now to him that is of power to stablish you,.... God is here described by
      his power, and the particular instance of it is the establishing of his
      people; that is, in the Gospel, as the Syriac version reads the next
      clause, and in the profession of it, with grace in their hearts, and in
      the exercise of it, and more lively and cheerful discharge of duty; See
      Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#011">Rom 1:11</a>;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to my Gospel; this is the means by which God usually
        establishes his people in faith and holiness; it is, indeed, an act of
        divine power, and which there is reason to hope and believe will be
        exerted; for words which express the power of God to do this, or the
        other thing, generally import willingness to do it, as the word does
        here; but then this is commonly done in the use of means: and that is
        the Gospel, than which nothing has a greater tendency to, and is better
        calculated for, and with a divine blessing always issues in the
        establishment of the saints. The apostle calls the Gospel his, not
        because he was the author of it, or the subject of it; but because he
        was the minister of it; it was that Gospel which he was sent and
        qualified to preach, and did preach fully and faithfully, and which he
        explains by the following clauses:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the preaching of Jesus Christ: being that Gospel which Jesus Christ
        himself preached, for which he was anointed and sent, and which first
        began to be spoken by him in its power and purity, and in such a manner
        as it never was before or since: and of which he also is the subject; it
        treats of his person, offices, righteousness, blood, sacrifice, and
        salvation; and which when preached aright is done in his name, by his
        authority, through gifts, grace, and strength received from him, and
        with a view to his glory: it follows as a further explanation of it,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to the revelation of the mystery; by which is meant, not, as
        some think, only the calling and conversion of the Gentiles through the
        preaching of the Gospel, though what is said of it well agrees with it;
        see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#003">Eph 3:3</a>; nor merely the
        mystery of Christ's incarnation and redemption by him; but the whole
        Gospel, and all the truths of it, which is often in Scripture called a
        "mystery", because the reason of many of its important doctrines does
        not clearly appear to the carnal reason of men; and the "modus" of
        several of them will ever remain inexplicable by us, as the doctrine of
        the Trinity, the sonship of Christ, and his incarnation, the
        resurrection, &amp;c. though the things themselves are most clearly
        revealed, as here "revelation" is ascribed unto them; by which is meant
        not that internal revelation of them, by the Spirit of God to the souls
        of men, though absolutely necessary to the understanding of them in a
        spiritual manner; nor the revelation of them to the apostles by Christ,
        by which, and not by men, they were taught and received; but that
        revelation which they have made of them in the external ministry of the
        word:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which was kept secret since the world began, or "from eternal times":
        from all the ages of the former dispensation, or that have run out from
        the beginning of the world; not that this mystery of the Gospel was
        entirely unknown, nor any hints given of it in those ages; for there
        certainly were, as to our first parents after the fall, to Abraham,
        Moses, David, Isaiah, and others; but it was but obscurely revealed,
        only some dark intimations were given of it; it was exhibited in types,
        shadows, and sacrifices; and, in a comparative sense, was wrapped up in
        darkness and silence, in reference to the more clear discovery and open
        exhibition of it under the Gospel dispensation.

      But now is made manifest,.... In these last days, in which God has spoken
      by his Son, by whom the doctrines of grace are most clearly revealed, and
      fully dispensed; and by his apostles, who were blessed with a clear
      insight into them, and with extraordinary gifts to minister them;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and by the Scriptures of the prophets; or prophetic writings, in which
        these truths are hinted, and by which, being made manifest by Christ and
        his apostles, they are attested and confirmed;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all
        nations for the obedience of faith; that is, it is by the express order
        and command of that God who is from everlasting to everlasting, that the
        mystery of the Gospel is made manifest by the preaching of the apostles
        being witnessed to by the law and prophets in all its doctrines;
        particularly justification by Christ's righteousness, remission of sins
        through his blood, and salvation by his sufferings and death; that this
        should be made known not only in the land of Judea, but to all the
        nations of the world; for this end, that many souls may be brought to
        submit to the righteousness of faith, to embrace the doctrine of faith,
        make a profession of it, be subject to the ordinances of it, live by
        faith on Christ, and also soberly, righteously and godly in this world:
        if this commandment refers, as it seems to do, to the order of Christ to
        his apostles, to preach the Gospel to Jews and Gentiles, to the Jews
        first, and upon their rejection of it, to turn to the Gentiles; for so,
        says the apostle, has the Lord commanded us,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046">Act 13:46</a>; here is a clear
        proof that Christ is God, and that he is the everlasting God.

      </p>
      To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ,.... This may be
      understood of God the Father, who is the only wise God, originally,
      essentially, and infinitely; though not to the exclusion of the Son and
      Spirit; and whose infinite wisdom appears in the works of creation and
      providence, in redemption and salvation by Christ, and in the whole scheme
      of the Gospel so largely commended in the foregoing verses: and the glory
      of all is displayed in, and to be given to him through Christ as Mediator;
      as the glory of his power and wisdom, particularly mentioned, who is the
      wisdom of God and the power of God; and the glory of the Gospel, of which
      Christ is the sum and substance; and the glory of salvation by him, and
      indeed of all his perfections; which is most illustriously manifested in
      it, in the contrivance, impetration, and application of it; and this glory
      is to be ascribed to him
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for ever, throughout the endless ages of eternity, as it will be by
        angels and men; to which the apostle sets his
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Amen, as wishing that so it might be, and as firmly believing that so it
        will be: the subscription of the epistle runs thus, "written to the
        Romans from Corinthus", and sent "by Phebe, servant of the church at
        Cenchrea": which though it is not in every copy, nor are the
        subscriptions at the end of the epistles always to be depended upon; yet
        this seems to be a right and true one, both with respect to the place
        from whence, and the person by whom it was sent, as well as with respect
        to the persons to whom it is inscribed, of which there is no doubt.
