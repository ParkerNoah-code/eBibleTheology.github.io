      Now we know that what things soever the law saith,.... By "the law" is
      meant, not the law of nature, nor the civil law of nations, nor the
      ceremonial law of the Jews, nor barely the five books of Moses, nor the
      book of Psalms, of the Prophets, or the writings of the whole Old
      Testament; but the moral law, as it appears in the whole word of God,
      which every man is bound to observe, of which all are transgressors, by
      which is the knowledge of sin, which no man can be justified by, and which
      Christ was made under, and came to fulfil. This law is represented as a
      person speaking, and saying many things, some of which are here mentioned;
      so, , "the law says" so and so, is an usual phrase with Jewish writers
      (y). The persons it speaks to, are
      <p></p>
      <p>
        them that are under the law; the Jews were in a peculiar sense under it,
        as it was given to them by Moses; all mankind are under it, as to the
        matter of it; they are under obligation to obedience to it, and, through
        disobedience, come under its sentence of condemnation. The elect of God
        themselves were, and are in some sense under it; not indeed as a
        covenant of works, or as in the hands of Moses, nor as a yoke of
        bondage; nor are they obliged to seek for justification by it, and are
        entirely delivered from the curse and condemnation of it by Christ. They
        were under it, and that as a covenant of works, as in Adam, the federal
        head and representative of all mankind; and came under its sentence of
        condemnation and death, for his sin, and their own actual
        transgressions; which is consistent with the everlasting love of God to
        them in Christ, the covenant of grace made with them in him, as their
        head and surety, and their justification by him: and they are now under
        it, as in the hands of Christ; and look upon themselves as obliged, by
        the love of Christ, to yield a cheerful obedience to it: here it means
        such as are transgressors of the law, and so under obligation to
        punishment, without any regard to Jew or Gentile, or any distinction God
        has made in his own breast: and the things it says to such are, it
        charges them with sin, and convicts them of it, both of its pollution
        and guilt: so
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that every mouth may be stopped; and have nothing to say of the purity
        of their nature, which appears to be so sadly stained; nor of their
        works of righteousness, which are so few, and so very imperfect. The law
        makes such a representation of things to them, that their mouths are
        stopped from glorying in themselves, and in their works, which are far
        from being adequate to the demands of the law; and from complaining
        against the righteous judgment of God, should he proceed against them in
        the most rigorous manner:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and all the world may become guilty before God; Jews and Gentiles; all
        the individuals of mankind are guilty before God, and will be found to
        be so, sooner or later: some read it, "subject to God", and understand
        it of a subjection to his grace, being brought to see their need of it,
        and of salvation by it; but this is not the case of all the world,
        rather signifies a subjection to that justice, vengeance, and wrath of
        God, to which all men are liable in their own persons; since they are
        all found guilty by the law, and will appear to be so, and therefore can
        never be justified by their obedience to it; which is what the apostle
        is aiming at in all he here says, as appears from what follows; all
        which "we know" to be true, and are fully assured of, who know the
        nature and spirituality of the law, and to whom it has come with light
        and power.

      Therefore by the deeds of the law,.... Hence it most clearly appears, that
      there can be no justification before God by the law, since it stops the
      mouths of men, and pronounces them guilty: by "the deeds of the law" are
      meant, works done in obedience to it, as performed by sinful men, which
      are very imperfect; not as performed by Adam in innocence or by Christ in
      our nature whose works were perfect; but as performed by sinful men and of
      themselves, and not as performed in and by Christ for them who is the
      fulfilling end of the law for righteousness to all believers: now by such
      works as these whether wrought before or after conversion, with or without
      the strength and grace of Christ,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: that is, no one person:
        "flesh" designs men, and men as corrupt and carnal, in opposition to
        God, who is a Spirit pure and holy; and may have respect to the vain
        opinion of Jews and Gentiles, who were vainly puffed up in their fleshly
        mind; the one on account of their wisdom and learning, the other on
        account of their righteousness; and includes all the individuals of
        human nature:, the word "justified", does not signify being made
        righteous by the infusion of righteousness, for the infusion of a
        righteousness, or holiness, is sanctification, which is a work of the
        Spirit of God, is internal, and imperfect, and so not justifying; but it
        is a forensic word, or legal term, and stands opposed to a being
        condemned; and signifies to be acquitted, discharged, and made righteous
        in a legal sense, which can never be done by an imperfect obedience to
        the law: men may be justified hereby in their own sight, and in the
        sight of others, but not in "his sight"; in the sight of God, who is
        omniscient, and sees not as man seeth; who is pure, holy, and righteous,
        and whose judgment is according to truth: this is said in direct
        contradiction to the Jews (z), who say,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"a man is not justified for ever, but by the words of the law:''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but in his sight none can be justified, but by the perfect obedience and
        righteousness of Christ. The reason for it is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for by the law is the knowledge of sin; it discovers to a man, by the
        light of the Spirit of God, and as under his influence, and attended
        with his power, the sins both of his heart and life; and so he is
        convinced by it as a transgressor and finds himself guilty, and liable
        to condemnation and death; wherefore he can never hope for and expect
        justification by it. The Jews ascribe such an use as this to the law,
        which they suppose it performs in a very gentle manner;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "he that rises in the night (say they (a)), and studies in the law, ,
        "the law makes known to him his sin", but not in a way of judgment, but
        as a mother makes known to her son in tender language:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but this is generally done in a rougher way, for the law works wrath.
