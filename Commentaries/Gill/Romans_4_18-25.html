      Who against hope believed in hope,.... Abraham believed the promise of
      God,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that he might become the father of many nations, being assisted by a
        supernatural aid: "in hope"; of the fulfilment of it by the grace and
        power of God: "against hope": against all visible, rational grounds of
        hope; Sarah's womb and his own body being dead, but inasmuch as God had
        said it, he believed:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to that which is spoken, so shall thy seed be; his faith
        rested upon the word of God, which showed the nature of it, and that it
        was of the right kind.
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      And being not weak in faith,.... Abraham was not weak in the exercise of
      his faith, on the promise of God; nor was his faith weakened about the
      accomplishment of it, neither by the length of time after the promise was
      made, nor by the seeming insuperable difficulties of nature which attended
      it; for
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he considered not his own body now dead. The Alexandrian copy reads
        without the negative, "he considered his own body now dead", and so the
        Syriac version: which makes his faith the greater, that though he did
        consider his case, yet his faith was not weakened: the phrase, "his body
        now dead", is an "euphemism" of the "merebrum virile", which by the
        Jews, when unfit for generation, is called , "merebrum emortuum" (t):
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        when he was about an hundred years old; not being quite an hundred years
        of age, wanting a year or thereabout:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb; how unfit she was to conceive
        and bear children: now though he might consider these things in his
        mind, yet they did not dwell upon his mind, nor he upon them; at least
        he did not consider them, so as to distrust the divine promise.
      </p>

      He staggered not at the promise of God,.... There is no reason to stagger
      at, or hesitate about any of the promises of God, since they are made by
      him that cannot lie; his faithfulness is engaged to perform them; with him
      all things are possible; every promise is in Christ, yea and amen, and
      never did any fail; and yet so it is, that some of God's children,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through unbelief, do stagger at the promises of God; thinking either
        that they are too great for them, or demur upon them through
        difficulties which attend them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>but so did not Abraham, he</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        was strong in faith; nothing moved him, no difficulties discouraged him,
        he made no demur upon the promise, nor had the least hesitation in his
        mind about the accomplishment of it; but was fully assured that so it
        would be, as God had said; and thus he was
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        giving glory to God; ascribing to him the glory of his veracity,
        faithfulness, power, grace, and goodness, as all such who are strong in
        faith do; such persons bring the most glory to God, and are the most
        comfortable in their own souls. This phrase, , "to be strong" or
        strengthened, or strengthen themselves "in faith", is to be met with in
        Jewish writings (u), and is particularly used of the patriarchs,
        Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; all the tribes of Israel are not said to be ,
        "strong in their faith"; only the tribe of Levi, when Moses stood in the
        gate and said, "who is on the Lord's side, let him come unto me" (Exo 32:26) whoever is ,
        "strong in his faith" (w); and there were none in all Israel but the
        tribe of Levi, who were "strong in their faith".
      </p>

      </p>
      And being fully persuaded,.... He had not only faith, a strong faith, but
      full assurance of faith:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that what he God had promised; though it was so long ago, and there were
        so many difficulties in the way;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>he was able, being the Lord God Almighty,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to perform; so his faith rested upon the power of God, with whom nothing
        is impossible.
      </p>
      <p align="center">

          ></span
        >
      </p>
      And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. Not because his
      faith was strong, and he had a full assurance of it, but because it was
      right, resting on the promise of God, and relying upon his power and
      faithfulness to perform it; for though the righteousness of faith is not
      imputed to any sort of believers, not to mere nominal ones, yet to all
      such as have true faith, though it may be but weak; for faith, as to
      nature, kind, and object, though not as to degree, is the same in all true
      believers, and the same righteousness is imputed to one as to another.

      Now it was not written for his sake alone,.... This was not left on the
      sacred records (Gen 15:6)
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that it was imputed to him; purely on his account, merely for his sake,
        as an encomium of his faith, and an honourable testimony to it, and for
        the encouragement of it; though this was doing him a very great honour,
        and was one design of it.
      </p>

      </p>
      But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed,.... What was written in the
      books of the Old Testament, was not written merely on account of them who
      are the subjects thereof, but for the use, learning, instruction and
      profit of saints under the New Testament dispensation; and particularly
      this concerning the pulsation of Abraham's faith for righteousness, or of
      the imputation of the righteousness of faith unto him for justification;
      which was not Abraham's faith, but that "righteousness" which his faith
      looked to, and laid hold on: see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#012">Rom 4:12</a>; for Abraham's
      faith itself could never be reckoned for righteousness to another, nor
      indeed was it to himself; but such as believe as Abraham did, they have
      the same righteousness imputed to them as he had; and truly of the same
      kind is the faith of Abraham, who believed in "God that quickeneth the
      dead", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017">Rom 4:17</a>; and that of
      ours:
      <p></p>
      <p>if, or "seeing"</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; which
        descriptive of the faith of New Testament believers, and of the object
        of it; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#009">Rom 10:9</a>; and
        which object of faith is further described in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025">Rom 4:25</a>.

      Who was delivered for our offences,.... Christ was delivered into the
      hands of men, and into the hands of justice, and unto death; and he was
      delivered by men, by Judas, to the chief priests, and by them to Pilate,
      and by Pilate to the Jews and Roman soldiers to be put to death; and he
      was also delivered up by his Father into the hands of justice and death,
      according to his determinate counsel and foreknowledge; but not without
      his own free consent, who voluntarily laid down his life, and gave himself
      a ransom for his people: he was delivered to death, not for any offences
      of his own, for he committed none; nor for the offences of angels, for
      these were not spared; nor for the offences, of all men, since all will
      not be saved; but for the offences of all God's elect: he was delivered
      for these, as the causes of his death, and as the end for which he died;
      namely, to make reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for them;
      which shows the love of the Father in delivering him up, and the grace and
      condescension of the Son in being willing to be delivered up on such an
      account: the nature and end of Christ's death may be learnt from hence,
      that he died not merely as a martyr, or as an example; nor only for the
      good, but in the room and stead of his people: we may also learn from
      hence the nature of sin, the strictness of justice, the obligations we lie
      under to Christ, and how many favours and blessings we may expect from God
      through him: who also
      <p></p>
      <p>
        was raised again for our justification; he was raised again from the
        dead by his Father, to whom this is often ascribed; and by himself, by
        his own power, which proves him to be the mighty God; and this was done
        not only that he might live an immortal and glorious life in our nature,
        having finished the work he undertook and came about, but for "our
        justification". He died in the room and stead of his people, and by
        dying made satisfaction for their sins; he rose again as their head and
        representative, and was legally discharged, acquitted, and justified,
        and they in him. Christ's resurrection did not procure the justification
        of his people, that was done by his obedience and death; but was for the
        testification of it, that it might fully appear that sin was atoned for,
        and an everlasting righteousness was brought in; and for the application
        of it, or that Christ might live and see his righteousness imputed, and
        applied to all those for whom he had wrought it out.
