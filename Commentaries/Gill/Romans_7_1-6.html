      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The Apostle, in this chapter, discourses concerning the freedom of
        justified and regenerated persons from the law, and concerning the
        nature, use, and excellency of it; in which he removes several
        objections to it, and gives an account from his own experience of the
        struggle and combat there is between flesh and spirit in a regenerate
        person; and which shows, that though believers are justified from sin,
        yet still sin remains in them, and is the complaint of their souls.
        Whereas he had in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014">Rom 6:14</a>, of the preceding
        chapter, asserted that believers are not under the law, but under grace:
        he knew that this would be matter of offence to the believing Jews, who
        still retained an high opinion of the law; wherefore he takes it up in
        the beginning of this chapter, and explains his meaning, and shows in
        what sense justified ones are delivered from it; and first observes a
        known maxim, which everyone, especially such as know anything of the
        nature of laws, must allow of; that the law has power over a man as long
        as he lives, and no longer,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#001">Rom 7:1</a>, and then
        particularly instances in the law of marriage,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#002">Rom 7:2</a>, which is in force
        as long as both parties live and no longer: during the husband's life
        the wife is bound, but when dead she is loosed, and which is further
        explained, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#003">Rom 7:3</a>, that
        should she marry another while her husband is alive, she would be an
        adulteress; but he being dead, should she marry, she is liable to no
        such imputation: this the apostle accommodates,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004">Rom 7:4</a>, to the case of
        the law, and the saints' deliverance from it, in which he asserts that
        they are dead to the law, and that to them, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006">Rom 7:6</a>, by the body of
        Christ; and therefore the law could have no dominion over them, as is
        the case of all laws when men are dead; and so they might be lawfully
        married to another, to bring forth fruit to God, according to the
        particular law of marriage. This is illustrated by the different state
        and condition of God's elect, before and after conversion; whilst in an
        unconverted state the law irritates indwelling sin, and the lusts of it,
        and by the members of the body operates to the bringing forth the deadly
        fruit of sin, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005">Rom 7:5</a>, but
        when delivered from the irritating power of the law, that being dead in
        consequence of the sufferings and death of Christ, they are both in a
        capacity, and under an obligation to serve the Lord, in a new and
        spiritual manner, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006">Rom 7:6</a>,
        and whereas he had said that the motions of sin are stirred up by the
        law, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005">Rom 7:5</a>, he saw that
        an objection might be raised against the law, as if that was sinful;
        this he removes by expressing his abhorrence of such a thought, by
        pointing out the law as that which makes known sin, and by the
        experience he himself had of it, making known indwelling sin to him,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007">Rom 7:7</a>, when he goes on
        to give an account of the workings of corrupt nature in him, under the
        prohibition of the law; how it was with him before it entered into his
        conscience, and how it was with him afterwards; that before he thought
        himself alive, and in a fair way to eternal life; but afterwards, as sin
        appeared to him more vigorous than ever, he found himself a dead man,
        and dead to all hope of life by the law, being killed by it, or rather
        by sin which worked by it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008">Rom 7:8</a>, and therefore he
        vindicates the law as holy, just, and good,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#012">Rom 7:12</a>, and answers an
        objection that might be formed from what he had said concerning the
        effect the law had upon him, as if it was made death unto him; whereas
        the office it did was to show him the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
        which, and not the law, was the cause of death,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013">Rom 7:13</a>, for to it with
        other saints he bears this testimony, that it is spiritual, though in
        comparison of it he was carnal and sold under sin,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014">Rom 7:14</a>, and from
        henceforward to the end of the chapter, he gives an account of the force
        and power of indwelling sin in him, and the conflict there was in him
        between grace and corruption: he had knowledge of that which is good,
        approved of it, and yet did it not, hated sin and yet committed it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015">Rom 7:15</a>, but however, his
        desire after that which was good, and his approbation of it, showed that
        he agreed to this, that the law was good,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#016">Rom 7:16</a>, nor was his
        commission of sin to be imputed to his renewed self, but to indwelling
        corruption, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#017">Rom 7:17</a>, the
        fleshly part in him, in which was no good thing,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018">Rom 7:18</a>, he found he had
        a will to that which is good, but not power to perform it; which was
        abundantly evident by his practice, seeing what he would he did not, and
        what he would not he did.
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019">Rom 7:19</a>, from whence he
        concludes again, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#020">Rom 7:20</a>,
        as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#017">Rom 7:17</a>, that the
        evil he did was to be reckoned not to his spiritual, or renewed self,
        but to his corrupt nature; which he found, as a law that had power to
        command and to cause to obey, always at hand, close by him when he was
        desirous of doing good,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#021">Rom 7:21</a>, and yet amidst
        all these workings of sin in him, he found a real delight and pleasure
        in the holy law of God, as he was renewed in the spirit of his mind,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#022">Rom 7:22</a>, upon the whole
        he perceived there were two contrary principles in him, which militated
        one against the other, and sometimes so it was, that through the
        strength of corrupt nature in him, he was made a captive to the law of
        sin and death, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023">Rom 7:23</a>,
        which fetched from him a doleful lamentation and complaint, as if his
        case was desperate, and there was no deliverance for him,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024">Rom 7:24</a>, and yet upon a
        view of his great Redeemer and Saviour, Jesus Christ, he takes heart,
        and thanks God that there was, and would be a deliverance for him
        through Christ, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025">Rom 7:25</a>,
        and then closes the account which stood thus in his experience, and does
        in the experience of every regenerate man; that with his renewed mind he
        served the holy law of God from a principle of grace, and with his
        fleshly and carnal part the law of sin.

      Know ye not, brethren,.... The apostle having asserted,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#014">Rom 6:14</a>, that the believing
      Romans were "not under the law"; which he knew would be displeasing to
      many, and excepted to by them, especially the Jews that were among them,
      who though they believed in Christ, yet were zealous of the law, takes it
      up again, and explains and defends it. That they were the Jewish converts
      at Rome he here particularly addresses, appears partly from his calling
      them "brethren", for they were so according to the flesh, as well as in a
      spiritual relation, and this he rather mentions to soften their
      resentments, and conciliate their minds to him; and partly from the words
      included in a parenthesis,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for I speak to them that know the law; not the law of nature, but the
        law of Moses, as the Jews did, being trained up in the knowledge of it;
        to these he appeals, saying, "know ye not", for the truth of a principle
        or maxim he afterwards improves, which they could not be ignorant of,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he, or "it",</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        liveth; for the word "liveth" may refer either to man or to the law. The
        law may be said to live, when it is in full force, and to be dead, when
        it is abrogated and disannulled; now whilst it lives, or is in force, it
        has dominion over a man; it can require and command obedience of him,
        and in case of disobedience can condemn him, and inflict punishment on
        him: and this power it has also as long as the man lives who is under
        it, but when he is dead it has no more dominion over him; then "the
        servant is free from his master",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#019">Job 3:19</a>; that is, from
        the law of his master; and children are free from the law of their
        parents, the wife from the law of her husband, and subjects from the law
        of their prince. This is so clear a point that none can doubt of it. The
        Jews have a saying (d), that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "when a man is dead, he becomes , free from the law, and from the
        commands.''
      </p>
      <p></p>

      </p>
      For the woman which hath an husband,.... The former general rule is here
      illustrated by a particular instance and example in the law of marriage; a
      woman that is married to a man,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        is bound by the law to her husband; to live with him, in subjection and
        obedience to him,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        so long as he liveth; except in the cases of adultery,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#009">Mat 19:9</a>, and desertion,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#015">Co1 7:15</a>, by which the
        bond of marriage is loosed, and for which a divorce or separation may be
        made, which are equal to death:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband;
        the bond of marriage is dissolved, the law of it is abolished, and she
        is at entire liberty to marry whom she will,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#039">Co1 7:39</a>.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#003">Romans 7:3</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="margnote"
          ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"
            ><a name="an_003">rom 7:3</a></font
          ></span
        >
      </p>
      So then if while her husband liveth,.... True indeed it is, that whilst
      her husband is alive, if
      <p></p>
      <p>
        she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; she
        will be noted and accounted of as such everybody, except in the above
        mentioned cases:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but if her husband be dead; then there can be no exception to her
        marriage:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        she is free from the law; of marriage, by which she was before bound:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        so that she is no adulteress; nor will any reckon her such; she is clear
        from any such imputation:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        though she be married to another man; hence it appears that second
        marriages are lawful.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004">Romans 7:4</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="margnote"

          ></span
        >
      </p>
      Wherefore, my brethren, ye also,.... Here the apostle accommodates the
      foregoing instance and example to the case in hand, showing, that the
      saints were not under the law, the power and dominion of it; since that,
      as when a man is dead, the woman is loosed from that law by which she was
      bound whilst he lived, that she may lawfully marry another man, and bear
      children to him without the imputation of adultery; so believers being
      dead to the law, and the law dead to them, which is all one, they are
      loosed from it, and may be, and are lawfully married to Christ, that they
      may bring forth the genuine fruits of good works, not in order to obtain
      righteousness and life by them, but for the honour and glory of God; in
      which account may be observed, an assertion that the saints and children
      of God
      <p></p>
      <p>
        are become dead to the law, and that to them, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#006">Rom 7:6</a>, and can have no
        more power over them than a law can have over dead persons, or a dead
        abrogated law can have over living ones. They are represented as "dead
        to sin", and "dead with Christ",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002">Rom 6:2</a>; and here, "dead
        to the law", as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#019">Gal 2:19</a>, and consequently
        cannot be under it; are out of the reach of its power and government,
        since that only has dominion over a man as long as be lives the law is
        dead to them; it has no power over them, to threaten and terrify them
        into obedience to it; nor even rigorously to exact it, or command it in
        a compulsory way; nor is there any need of all this, since believers
        delight in it after the inward man, and serve it with their minds freely
        and willingly; the love of Christ, and not the terrors of the law,
        constrains them to yield a cheerful obedience to it; it has no power to
        charge and accuse them, curse or condemn them, or minister death unto
        them, no, not a corporeal one, as a penal evil, and much less an eternal
        one. And the way and means by which they become dead to the law, and
        that to them is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by the body of Christ; not by Christ, as the body or substance of the
        ceremonial law; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017">Col 2:17</a>; since that is
        not singly designed, but the whole law of Moses; but by "the body of
        Christ", is either meant Christ himself,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#010">Heb 10:10</a>, or rather the
        human nature of Christ,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#005">Heb 10:5</a>, in which the law
        meets with every thing it can require and demand, as holiness of nature,
        which is the saints' sanctification in Christ; obedience of life, which
        is their righteousness; and sufferings of death, which is the penalty
        the law enjoins, whereby full expiation of sin is made, complete pardon
        is procured, and eternal redemption obtained; so that the law has
        nothing more to demand; its mouth is stopped, it is not in its power to
        curse and damn believers, they are dead to that, and that to them: the
        reason why the law is become so to them, and they to that, is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that ye should be married to another; or "that ye should be to another",
        or "be another's"; that is, that ye should appear to be so in a just and
        legal way; for they were another's, they were Christ's before by the
        Father's gift, and were secretly married to him in the everlasting
        covenant, before he assumed their nature, and in the body of his flesh
        bore their sins, satisfied law and justice, paid their debts, and so
        freed them from the power of the law, its curse and condemnation, or any
        obligation to punishment; all which was done in consequence of his
        interest in them, and their marriage relation to him; but here respect
        is had to their open marriage to him in time, the day of their espousals
        in conversion; to make way for which, the law, their former husband,
        must be dead, and they dead to that, that so their marriage to Christ
        might appear lawful and justifiable; who is very fitly described by him,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who is raised from the dead; and is a living husband, and will ever
        continue so, will never die more; and therefore as the saints can never
        be loosed from the marriage bond of union between Christ and them, so
        they can never be loosed from the law of this husband; wherefore though
        they are dead to the law as a covenant of works, and as ministered by
        Moses, and are free from any obligation to it, as so considered, yet
        they are "under the law to Christ",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#021">Co1 9:21</a>; under
        obligation, by the ties of love, to obedience to it, and shall never be
        loosed from it. The end of being dead to the law, and of being married
        to Christ, is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that we should bring forth fruit unto God. The allusion is to children
        being called "the fruit of the womb",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003">Psa 127:3</a>, and here
        designs good works, the fruits of righteousness, which are brought forth
        by persons espoused to Christ, under the influence of the Spirit and
        grace of God; and they are "unto God", that is, for the honour and glory
        of God; meaning either Christ the husband of believers, who is God over
        all blessed for ever; or God the Father, to whose praise and glory they
        are by Christ; and which is a reason and argument which strongly excites
        and encourages the saints to the performance of them: and let it be
        observed, that as children begotten and born in lawful marriage are only
        true and legitimate, and all before marriage are spurious and
        illegitimate; so such works only are the true and genuine fruits of
        righteousness, which are in consequence of a marriage relation to
        Christ; are done in faith, spring from love, and are directed to the
        glory of God; and all others, which are done before marriage to Christ,
        and without faith in him, are like spurious and illegitimate children.

      For when we were in the flesh,.... This respects not their being under the
      legal dispensation, the Mosaic economy; which lay greatly in meats and
      drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, such as regarded the
      flesh chiefly; so their meats and drinks concerned the body; their
      ablutions and washings sanctified to the purifying of the flesh; their
      circumcision was outward in the flesh; the several rituals of the law
      consisted in outward things, though typical of internal and spiritual
      ones; hence those that trusted in them trusted in the flesh: but to be "in
      the flesh" stands opposed,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008">Rom 7:8</a>; to a being "in the
      spirit"; whereas there were many under that legal and carnal dispensation
      who were in the spirit, and had the Spirit of God, as David and others;
      besides, the apostle must be thought to use the phrase in such a sense, as
      to include all the persons he is speaking of and writing to, who were both
      Jews and Gentiles, for of such the church at Rome consisted; and the sense
      is this, "for when we", Jews and Gentiles, who are now believers in
      Christ, "were" formerly, before our conversion to, and faith in Christ,
      "in the flesh", that is, in a corrupt, carnal, and unregenerate state and
      condition; in which sense the word "flesh" is frequently used in the next
      chapter: now not all such who have flesh, sin, or corrupt nature in them,
      must be reckoned to be in the flesh, for there is a difference between
      flesh being in persons, from which none are free in this life, and their
      being in the flesh; nor all such who commit sin, or do carnal things at
      times, for there is not a just man that doth good and sinneth not; but
      such who are as they were born, without any alteration made in them by the
      Spirit and grace of God; who have nothing but flesh in them, no fear of
      God, nor love to and faith in Christ, nor any experience of the work of
      the Spirit of God upon their souls; no true sight and sense of sin, nor
      any spiritual knowledge of salvation by Christ; in whom flesh is the
      governing principle, whose minds and principles are carnal, and their
      conversation wholly so; yea, persons may be in the flesh, in an
      unregenerate state, who may abstain from the grosser immoralities of life,
      and even make a profession of religion: now such these had been the
      apostle is speaking of and to, and tells how it was with them when in this
      state;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the motions of sins which were by the law, did work in our members to
        bring forth fruit unto death: by "the motions of sin" are meant, the
        evil passions and affections of the mind, the lusts of the heart, sinful
        desires, evil thoughts, the imaginations of the thoughts of the heart,
        the first motions of the mind to sin: these "were by the law"; not as
        the efficient cause of them, that neither produces nor encourages them;
        it is holy, just, and good, requires truth in the inward parts, and not
        only forbids the outward acts of sin, but even covetous desires, and
        lustful thoughts: no, these inward motions of sin arise from a corrupt
        heart and nature; are encouraged and cherished by the old man that
        dwells there; and men are enticed by Satan to a compliance with them.
        Some think that the meaning of the phrase is, that these secret lusts of
        the heart are made known by the law, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007">Rom 7:7</a>, so they are, but
        not whilst a man is in the flesh, or in an unregenerate state, but when
        he comes to be wrought upon powerfully by the Spirit of God, who makes
        use of the law to such a purpose: but the true sense of it is, that
        these motions of sin are irritated, provoked, and increased, through the
        law's prohibition of them; which is not to be charged as a fault on the
        law, but to be imputed to the depravity and corruption of man; who is
        like to one in a burning fever, very desirous of drink, who the more it
        is forbid, the more eager is he of it; or like a mighty torrent of
        water, which rises, rages, flows, and overflows, the more any methods
        are taken to stop its current; or like a filthy dunghill, which when the
        sun strikes powerfully on it, it exhales and draws out its filthy
        stench; which nauseous smell is not to be imputed to the pure rays of
        the sun, but to the filthiness of the dunghill: these motions of sin are
        said to "work in our members"; in the members of our bodies, which these
        sinful affections of the soul make use of to put them into action, and
        so they bring forth fruit; very evil fruit indeed, for nothing else can
        be expected from such an evil tree as the corrupt nature of man is: and
        this fruit is "unto death": deadly fruit, worthy of death, and would
        issue in eternal death, if grace did not prevent: the rise, beginning,
        motion, progress, and issue of sin, are most exactly and beautifully
        described, agreeably to this account here, by the Apostle James,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013">Jam 1:13</a>.

      But now we are delivered from the law,.... From the ministration of it, by
      Moses; from it, as a covenant of works; from its rigorous exaction; from
      its curse and condemnation, all this by Christ; and from its being an
      irritating, provoking law to sin, through the corruption of nature, by the
      Spirit and grace of Christ; but not from obedience to it, as in the hands
      of Christ. The Vulgate Latin version, and some copies read, "from the law
      of death"; and the Ethiopic version renders it, "we are loosed from the
      law, and are delivered from the former doctrine"; the doctrine of the
      legal dispensation.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        That being dead; not sin, but the law: in what sense believers are dead
        to the law, and that to them; see Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#004">Rom 7:4</a>.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Wherein we were held: as a woman is by the law to her husband, or as
        persons guilty, who are detained prisoners; so we were "kept under the
        law, shut up unto the faith", as in a prison,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#023">Gal 3:23</a>; Now the saints
        deliverance from the law through the abrogation of it, that losing its
        former life, vigour, power, and dominion, is not that they may live a
        loose licentious life and conversation, but that they
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        should serve the Lord their God without slavish fear, and with a godly
        one, acceptably, in righteousness and holiness, all the days of their
        lives; and their Lord and Master Jesus Christ, who is King of saints,
        lawgiver in his church, and whose commandments are to be observed from a
        principle of love, in faith, and to his glory; yea, even the law itself,
        as held forth by him, as the apostle says in the close of this chapter,
        "with the mind I myself serve the law of God",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025">Rom 7:25</a>, the manner in
        which this service is to be, and is performed, is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in newness of Spirit; under the influences of the Spirit of God, the
        author of renovation, of the new creature, or new man created in us, in
        righteousness and true holiness; and from a new heart, and new Spirit,
        and new principles of life, light, love, and grace, formed in the soul;
        and by walking in "newness of life",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004">Rom 6:4</a>, or by a new life,
        walk, and conversation:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and not in the oldness of the letter; not in the outward observance of
        the law of Moses, which is the "letter"; not indulging the old man, or
        walking after the dictates of corrupt nature; nor behaving according to
        the old former course of living: on the whole it may be observed, that a
        believer without the law, being delivered from it, that being dead to
        him, and he to that, lives a better life and conversation under the
        influence of the Spirit of God, than one that is under the law, and the
        works of it, destitute of the grace of God; the one brings forth "fruit
        unto death",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005">Rom 7:5</a>, the other serves
        the Lord, "in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter".
