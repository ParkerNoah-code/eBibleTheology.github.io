      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter contains the inscription of the epistle, and salutation,
        the preface to it, and the grand proposition of justification by faith,
        so much enlarged on afterwards; and that this could not be by the law of
        nature, and the works of it among the Gentiles, is demonstrated by a
        detail of their horrible wickedness, impiety, and unrighteousness. In
        the inscription an account is given of the author of the epistle, who is
        described in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#001">Rom 1:1</a> by his name Paul:
        by his relation to Christ, a servant of his; and by his office, an
        apostle, whose business and concern were with the Gospel; to which he
        was separated. This Gospel is commended from the author of it, who is
        God himself; and from the antiquity of it (Rom 1:2) being as ancient
        as the writings of the prophets; and from the subject of it, being the
        Lord Jesus Christ; who is described by his relation to God, his Son, by
        his dominion over the saints, their Lord, by both his natures, human and
        divine; his human nature, as being of the seed of David, his divine
        nature, being the Son of God (Rom 1:4) which is declared
        by the power he is possessed of, by the Spirit of holiness that is in
        him, by his resurrection from the dead, and by the apostles receiving
        from him grace to fit them for their office, and by the office itself:
        the end of which was to make some among all nations obedient to him (Rom 1:5) among whom were
        the saints at Rome, who were called by him, and after his name (Rom 1:6) which introduces
        the account of the persons to whom this epistle is written, who are
        described (Rom 1:7) by the
        place of their abode, Rome; by their interest in the love of God; and by
        the effect, fruit, and evidence of it, their effectual calling; and then
        follows the apostle's usual salutation, as in all his epistles, in which
        he wishes grace and peace for them, from God the Father, and from
        Christ. The preface begins
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#008">Rom 1:8</a>, in which are a
        thanksgiving to God, through Christ, for all the saints at Rome,
        particularly on account of their faith, for which they were everywhere
        so famous; an appeal to God (Rom 1:9) for the truth of
        his incessant prayers for them, and particularly (Rom 1:10) that this was a
        request he made, that if it was the will of God, he might have a speedy
        and prosperous journey to, them; an expression of strong affection to
        them, and of his great desire to see them (Rom 1:11) his end in which
        was partly for their sakes, to communicate spiritual things to them for
        their establishment, and partly for his own comfort, and the increase of
        the mutual faith of both (Rom 1:12) also a
        vindication of himself (Rom 1:13) showing, that it
        was not any fault of his, or any neglect of them by him, that he had not
        been with them as yet, but some things hindered him, in the execution of
        his purpose to come to them; to which he was moved, partly by the hope
        of having fruit among them, as among others, and partly through the
        obligation that lay upon him by virtue of his office, to preach the
        Gospel to all sorts of men (Rom 1:14) he expresses his
        willingness and readiness to preach the Gospel to them at Rome, as soon
        as an opportunity would offer (Rom 1:15) which was his
        work and office, what he delighted in, was closely attached to, and by
        no means ashamed of (Rom 1:16) partly because
        of the nature of it, it was the Gospel, good news and true: and partly
        because of the author and subject of it, Christ; as also because of the
        efficacy of it in the salvation of Jews and Gentiles; and likewise
        because of a principal doctrine revealed in it (Rom 1:17) the doctrine of
        justification by faith, in the righteousness of Christ, confirmed and
        illustrated by a passage out of
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004">Hab 2:4</a>, and which he
        particularly mentions, because he intended to dwell upon it in this
        epistle: and in order to show that the Gentiles could not be justified
        in the sight of God by their obedience to the law, and the light of
        nature, he observes, that they were the objects of the wrath of God (Rom 1:18) and that very
        justly, because they sinned knowingly; they had some knowledge of the
        truth, but they would not profess it: and that they had such knowledge
        of it, he proves from the author of it, God, who showed it to them (Rom 1:19) and from the
        means of it, by which they must, and did arrive to some degree of it,
        namely, the works of creation,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020">Rom 1:20</a>. The apostle goes
        on to expose the ingratitude of them, the vanity of their minds, the
        pride and folly of their hearts (Rom 1:21) the gross
        idolatry they were guilty of (Rom 1:23) for which
        idolatry they were given up to their own hearts' lusts, to commit the
        foulest and most scandalous iniquities, even to commit sodomitical
        practices, and unnatural lusts, both men and women,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#024">Rom 1:24</a>. And so far were
        they from having a righteousness to justify them before God, that they
        were titled with all unrighteousness; and a large list of the vilest
        sins, being committed by them, is given; and a catalogue of the worst of
        sinners, as among them,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#029">Rom 1:29</a>. All which are
        aggravated by their knowledge of the will of God, through the light of
        nature, that these things were contrary to it, and were deserving of
        death; and yet they both did them, and were delighted with those that
        committed them also: the inference which he leaves to be deduced from
        hence, and which may easily be deduced, is, that therefore there can be
        no justification of such persons in the sight of God by their own works.

      Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ,.... The name of the author of this
      epistle is Paul, who formerly was called Saul. Some think his name was
      changed upon his own conversion; others, upon the conversion of the Roman
      deputy Sergius Paulus,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#007">Act 13:7</a>; others, that he
      was so called from the littleness of his stature; but rather it should
      seem that he had two names, which was usual with the Jews; one by which
      they went among the Gentiles, and another by they were called in their own
      land; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#009">Act 13:9</a>.
      "A servant of Jesus Christ"; not a servant of sin, nor of Satan, nor of
      man, nor of Moses and his law, nor of the traditions of the elders, but of
      Jesus Christ; and not by creation only, but by redemption, and by powerful
      efficacious grace in conversion; which is no ways contrary to true
      liberty; nor a disgraceful, but a most honourable character; and which
      chiefly regards him as a minister of the Gospel:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        called to be an apostle: an apostle was one that was immediately sent by
        Christ, and had his authority and doctrine directly from him, and had a
        power of working miracles from him, in confirmation of the truth of his
        mission, authority, and doctrine; all which were to be found in the
        author of this epistle, who did not thrust himself into this office, or
        take this honour to himself, of which he always judged himself unworthy,
        but was "called" to it according to the will, and by the grace of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        separated unto the Gospel of God. This may regard either God's eternal
        purpose concerning him, his preordination of him from eternity to be a
        preacher of the Gospel, to which he was separated from his mother's
        womb,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015">Gal 1:15</a>; or the
        separation of him to that work made by the order of the Spirit of God,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002">Act 13:2</a>. The phrase used
        is either in allusion to the priests and Levites, who were separated
        from their brethren the children of Israel, to their sacred employments;
        or rather to the apostle's having been "a Pharisee", which signifies
        "one separated", as he was now; only with this difference, before he was
        separated to the law, but now "to the Gospel", to preach and defend it,
        which he did with all faithfulness and integrity; the excellency of
        which Gospel is signified by its being called "the Gospel of God": he is
        the author of it; his grace is the subject of it; and he it is who
        commits it to men, qualifies them for the preaching of it, and succeeds
        them in it.

      </p>
      Which he had promised afore,.... The Gospel is here further commended from
      the antiquity it: it was no novel doctrine, an upstart notion, but what
      God had conceived in his own breast from eternity. This mystery was hid in
      him from the beginning of the world, and was ordained before the world
      was; in time God was pleased to make it known to the sons of men; he
      "promised" it, he spoke of it, and declared it
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by his prophets, Isaiah and others, "afore" the Apostle Paul was called
        forth to be a preacher of it; which promise, or promises of it, lie
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in the Holy Scriptures; the books of the Old Testament, so called from
        the author, matter, and usefulness of them. The apostle speaks in the
        language of his nation, for the Jews frequently call the Bible,
        writings, Holy Ones; "for", say they, , "all the Scriptures are holy"
        (c), and style them, , "Scriptures of holiness", or holy Scriptures (d).

      Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord,.... These words are in
      connection with "the Gospel of God" (Rom 1:1) and express the
      subject matter of it, the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord; for Christ,
      as the Son of God, the Saviour of sinners, the only Mediator between God
      and men, who is Lord both of the dead and living, is the sum and substance
      of the Gospel: he is here described by his relation to God, his Son, of
      the same nature with him, equal to him, and distinct from him; by his
      usual names, "Jesus Christ", the one signifying a "Saviour", the other
      "anointed", and both, that he was anointed of God to be the Saviour of his
      people; and by his dominion over the saints our Lord, not merely by
      creation, but by redemption and grace, and happy is the person that can
      claim interest in him, as is here done; and by the distinction of natures
      in him:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; this
        respects Christ in his human nature, who was made flesh, and of a woman;
        and shows his existence before his incarnation, and the immediate power
        and hand of God in it; and which was done, not by transmutation of him
        into flesh, but by an assumption of human nature into union with his
        divine person: he is said to be made "of the seed of David"; this points
        out the family from whence he sprung; designs the posterity of David,
        particularly Mary; has regard to the promise made to David, which God
        fulfilled; and shows the royal descent of Christ: it is added,
        "according to the flesh"; that is, according to his human nature; which
        phrase does not denote the corruption, but the truth of that nature; and
        supposes that he had another nature, otherwise there would have been no
        need of this limiting and restrictive clause.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004">Romans 1:4</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="margnote"

            ><a name="an_004">rom 1:4</a></font
          ></span
        >
      </p>
      And declared to be the Son of God,.... Not made as he is said to be
      before, when his incarnation is spoken of; nor did he begin to be the Son
      of God, when he was made of the seed of David, but he, the Son of God, who
      existed as such, from everlasting, was manifested in the flesh, or human
      nature: and this his divine sonship, and proper deity, are declared and
      made evident,
      <p></p>
      <p>with, or "by"</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        his power; which has appeared in the creation of all things out of
        nothing; in upholding all things in their beings; in the government of
        the world, and works of Providence; in the miracles he wrought; in his
        performing the great work of redemption; in the success of his Gospel,
        to the conversion of sinners; and in the preservation of his churches
        and people: here it seems chiefly to regard the power of Christ in
        raising the dead, since it follows, and which is to be connected with
        this clause,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by the resurrection from the dead; and designs either the resurrection
        of others, as of Lazarus, and some other persons, in his lifetime, and
        of some at his resurrection, and of all at the last day: or the
        resurrection of his own body, which dying he had power to raise up
        again, and did; and which declared him to be, or clearly made it appear
        that he was the Son of God, a divine person, truly and properly God: and
        this was done
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to the Spirit of holiness; which may be understood of the Holy
        Spirit, the third person in the Trinity, who is holy in himself, and the
        author of holiness in the saints; and who is the declarer of Christ's
        sonship, partly by bearing a testimony to it in the word, and in the
        hearts of believers, and chiefly by being concerned in the resurrection
        of the body of Christ from the dead; or else by the Spirit of holiness
        may be meant the divine nature of Christ, which, as it is holy, so by it
        Christ offered himself to God, and by it was quickened, or made alive,
        when he had been put to death in the flesh; and which must be a clear
        and strong proof of his being truly the Son of God.

      By whom we have received grace and apostleship,.... That is, either by the
      Holy Spirit, from whom all grace and gifts come, qualifying for the
      discharge of any office; or by the Lord Jesus Christ, who is full of grace
      and truth, has received gifts for, and gives them to men to fit them for
      whatsoever service he is pleased to call them to. By "grace and
      apostleship" may be meant, either one and the same thing, the favour and
      honour of being the apostles of Christ; or different things, and the one
      in order to the other. Grace may design special saving grace in calling,
      justification, pardon, and adoption, and sanctification, which was
      received in common with other saints, and is absolutely necessary to an
      apostle, and to any ordinary minister of the word; or the doctrine of
      grace, which they received from Christ, and dispensed to others; or rather
      the gifts of grace, and the various measures thereof, which they received
      from their ascended Lord and King, by which they were furnished for
      apostleship, that is, the work and office of apostles; to which they were
      called by Christ, and from whom they received a commission to execute it.
      The apostle takes in others sides himself, and says, "we have received";
      partly for the sake of modesty, and partly to keep up his equal title with
      others to this office; and since this is had in a way of receiving, which
      supposes giving, and excludes boasting, it obliges to make use of all
      grace and gifts to the glory of Christ, by whom they are received. The end
      for which they received such an office, and grace to fit them for it, was,
      "for obedience to the faith"; that men might be brought by the ministry of
      the word to obey the faith, Christ the object of faith; to submit to his
      righteousness, and the way of salvation by him, and to be subject to his
      ordinances or to obey the doctrine of faith, which is not barely to hear
      it, and notionally receive it, but to embrace it heartily by faith, and
      retain it, in opposition to a disbelief and contempt of it; and which is
      the end and design of the Gospel ministration to bring persons to,
      Moreover, by
      <p></p>
      <p>
        obedience to the faith, or "obedience of faith", as it may be rendered,
        may be meant the grace of faith, attended with evangelical obedience;
        for obedience, rightly performed, is only that which is by faith, and
        springs from it. Now grace and apostleship were received, in order to be
        exercised
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        among all nations; not in Judea only, to which the first commission of
        apostleship was limited, but in all the nations of the world, as the
        commission renewed by Christ after his resurrection ordered; and that
        some among all nations of the earth might, by the power of divine grace
        accompanying the word, be brought to faith and obedience: and all this,
        the qualifications for the office, the due exercise of it in all the
        world, and the success that attended it, were
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for his name; for the honour and glory of Christ, in whose name they
        went, and which they bore and carried among the Gentiles, out of whom he
        was pleased "to take a people for his name",

      Among whom are ye also,.... The Romans, though they were the chief, were
      among the nations of the world to whom the apostles were sent; and since
      Paul was called to be an apostle, and had, as others, grace and
      apostleship, and particularly the apostleship of the uncircumcision, or
      was ordained a teacher of the Gentiles, more especially he was an apostle
      to them, and as such was to be regarded by them. This seems to point out
      what they were originally; they were among all nations which lay in
      darkness; and were without Christ and hope, and God in the world; but now,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the called of Jesus Christ. The calling here spoken of is not to an
        office, or a mere external one by the ministry of the word, but an
        internal special call by the grace of God; and which is irresistible,
        efficacious, and unchangeable, and is an high, holy, and heavenly one;
        by it persons are called out of darkness into light, out of bondage into
        liberty, out of the world, from the company of the men of it, and the
        sinful pleasures thereof, to fellowship with Christ and his saints, and
        off a dependence on themselves, and their own righteousness, to the
        grace and righteousness of Christ, and to eternal glory. The persons so
        called are the elect of God, who are secured in Christ, and redeemed by
        him, and who has a concern with the Father and Spirit in the calling of
        them: hence they are styled, "the called of Jesus Christ"; they are
        called by him, and after his name; he has an interest in them; as they
        were before his chosen and redeemed ones, they are now his called ones;
        as Jacob and Israel of old were named of God, "my called",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#012">Isa 48:12</a>; so these were
        named Christ's called ones; and who by calling came to be partakers of
        him and of his grace.

      To all that be in Rome,.... These words contain both the inscription of
      the epistle, and the apostle's usual salutation, as in all his epistles,
      The inscription of it is not to the Roman emperor; nor to the Roman
      senate, nor to all the inhabitants in Rome; but to all the saints there,
      whether rich or poor, bond or free, male or female, Jew or Gentile,
      without any distinction, being all one in Christ Jesus: and these are
      described as
      <p></p>
      <p>
        beloved of God; not for any loveliness there was in them, nor because of
        any love in them to God, nor on account of their obedience and
        righteousness; but through the free favour and sovereign will and
        pleasure of God, who loved them before he called them, even from
        eternity, and will love them to eternity; which love of his is the
        source and spring of all the blessings of grace, and, among the rest, of
        the effectual calling: hence this character is set before the following
        one,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        called to be saints; not born so, nor become so through their own power,
        but were so by calling grace, as a fruit of everlasting love; men are
        first beloved of the Lord, and then called to be his saints. The
        salutation follows; the things wished for in it are,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        grace to you, and peace: by "grace" is not meant ministerial gifts,
        which are not common to all the saints; nor the Gospel, which was at
        Rome already; nor the love and favour of God, which these persons were
        sharers in, as appears from their above characters; nor the principle of
        grace, which was now formed there in their effectual calling; but an
        increase of grace, as to its degrees, acts, and exercise; every grace is
        imperfect in this respect, and those who have the most stand in need of
        more; there is such a thing as growing in grace, which is very
        desirable, and may be expected from God, who is able to make all grace
        to abound, and has promised to give more: by "peace" is meant, peace
        with God through Christ; peace in their own consciences, and with one
        another; all manner of prosperity inward and outward here, and eternal
        happiness hereafter. The persons from whom these are desired are,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; God the Father of Christ is
        spoken of as our Father, which is by adoption; partly to engage fear and
        reverence of him at his throne; and partly to encourage freedom and
        boldness there, and an expectation of receiving every blessing of grace
        from him: "the Lord Jesus Christ" is mentioned, as being the person
        through whom, and for whose sake, all the blessings of grace and peace
        are communicated to us; and being put upon a level with the Father in
        these petitions, shows him to be equal with him, and so truly and
        properly God. "Grace" may be thought to be particularly wished for from
        the Father, though not exclusive of Christ, since he is the God of all
        grace, who has treasured up a fulness of it in his Son. And "peace" may
        be considered as desired to be had from Christ, though not exclusive of
        the Father; since the covenant of peace was made with him, the
        chastisement of peace was laid on him, and he has made peace by the
        blood of his cross, and is the giver of it to his people.

      First, I thank my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all,.... After the
      inscription and salutation, follows a thanksgiving, which begins the
      epistle: it is usual with the apostle in all his epistles to make requests
      for the churches, with thanksgivings for mercies; his view in it was, to
      glorify God, to testify his affection to the saints, and to show that all
      they had must be referred to the grace of God. The object of thanksgiving
      is God not merely as a creator and preserver, but as a Father, the Father
      of Christ, and our Father in Christ; as the one God, and our God, Father,
      Son, and Spirit. The apostle styles him, my God; which distinguishes him
      from all others, points out his particular interest in him, expresses his
      knowledge of him and faith in him, and demonstrates that what he did now,
      he did in faith. The person through whom thanks are given is Jesus Christ.
      There is no coming to God but through Christ, nor is any sacrifice either
      of prayer or praise acceptable without him, and since all we have come
      through him, it is but reasonable that thanks for them should be returned
      by and through him; the persons for whom this thanksgiving is made were
      all the Romans, all the saints at Rome, the members of the church there,
      of whatsoever rank and degree, and in whatsoever, state and condition; the
      thing for which the apostle was thankful for particularly was, not that
      their city was mistress of the whole world, and their fame for power,
      wealth, and grandeur, was spread abroad far and near; but, says he,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world; which shows
        that faith is a grace of great account: God has put an honour upon it,
        by making it the receiver of all his gifts, and that gives glory to God,
        and without it nothing is acceptable to him; it answers many excellent
        uses and purposes in experience; it is that by which saints live upon
        Christ in this world, and look to the glories of another. This also
        shows that the saints at Rome did not hide their faith in their breasts,
        but declared it to others; a public profession both of the grace and
        doctrine of faith is to be made, and constantly held; both are to be
        shown forth to others, by deeds as well as words; which greatly redounds
        to the honour of such churches, causes joy in other churches, and in all
        the ministers of the Gospel, and is the occasion of many thanksgivings
        to God.
