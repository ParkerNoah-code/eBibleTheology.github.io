      What then? shall we sin,.... Does it follow from hence, that therefore we
      may sin, and go on and continue in it,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        because we are not under the law, but under grace? here the apostle
        meets with an objection of the adversary, saying, that if men are not
        under the law, and are free from all obligation to it, then they may
        live as they list; nor can they be chargeable with sin, or that be
        objected to them; since where there is no law, there is no
        transgression, and sin is not imputed where there is no law; and if they
        are under grace, or in the love and favour of God, from which there is
        no separation, then they cannot be damned, do what they will: but this
        objection proceeds upon a mistaken sense of the phrase, "under the law";
        for believers, though they are not under the law as the ministry of
        Moses, yet they are under it, as it is in the hands of Christ; and
        though not under its curse, yet under obligation to obedience to it,
        from principles of love and grace; and a transgression of it is sin in
        them, as in others; and which is taken notice of by God, and visited
        with stripes in a: fatherly way, though his loving kindness is not
        removed: and to argue from the unchangeableness of God's grace, or the
        doctrines of it, as encouraging licentiousness, is greatly to abuse the
        grace of God, and manifestly betrays such persons to be ignorant of it
        and its influence; since nothing more powerfully engages to a love of
        holiness, and hatred of sin; wherefore the apostle, answers to this
        objection in his usual way,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>God forbid; signifying his abhorrence of everything of this kind.</p>

      </p>
      Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves,.... The apostle goes on
      with his answer to the above objection, by making use of an argument from
      the nature of servants and their obedience, a thing well known to
      everyone, and which none could be ignorant of; which he delivers by way of
      distribution, that such who yield themselves
      <p></p>
      <p>
        servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin
        unto death, or obedience unto righteousness: such who obey sin, are the
        servants of sin; they are at the beck and command of sin; they give up
        themselves to the service of it with delight and diligence, and are
        perfect drudges to it: this is a very unhappy situation; their service
        is very unreasonable; and they are rendered incapable of serving God,
        for no man can serve two masters; they are hereby brought into the
        drudgery of the devil; into a state of bondage, out of which nothing but
        grace can extricate them; into a very mean and contemptible condition,
        and even a deplorable one; for if grace prevent not, they will have the
        wages of sin paid them, which is death, for their obedience is "of sin
        unto death"; which will lie in an eternal separation from Father, Son,
        and Spirit, in a sense of divine wrath, and in the company of devils and
        damned spirits: now this is added, to show the malignant nature and just
        demerit of sin, and to deter and dissuade persons from the service of
        it: on the other hand, such as obey the Lord, are the servants "of
        obedience unto righteousness": but why is not this obedience, which is
        the obedience of faith to the Gospel, of Christ, and of the new man to
        God or Christ, said to be "unto life", as the antithesis seems to
        require? because though death is the fruit of sin, yet life is not the
        fruit of obedience, but the fruit of obedience is righteousness; by
        which is meant, nor a justifying one before God, but righteousness
        before men; or a course of living soberly and righteously, which is the
        effect of being under grace; and hence it appears, that true believers
        can make no such ill use of their privilege, as is suggested in the
        objection.

      </p>
      But God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin,.... Not that the
      apostle must be thought to give thanks to God for that these persons had
      been the servants of sin, than which nothing is more disagreeable to God,
      or caused more shame to themselves; but that inasmuch as they had been in
      the drudgery and service of sin, they were now freed from it. Just as if a
      person, that has been a slave for some time in Algiers, should bless God,
      or be thankful to the instrument of his deliverance, that whereas he had
      been in such slavery, he is now redeemed from it: wherefore it is added,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
        delivered you. By "the form of doctrine", is meant the Gospel, which is
        the "doctrine" of the Scriptures, of Christ and his apostles, and is
        sound and according to godliness; and is a "form", or contains a summary
        and compendium of truths, and is a pattern or exemplar, according to
        which ministers are to preach, and people to hear and receive. So the
        word which is the same with here, is used by the Jewish (y) writers for
        a form, copy, pattern, or exemplar of any sort of writings This form of
        doctrine is "a Cabala", but not like that of the Jews' oral law, or form
        of traditions (z), handed down, as they say, from one man, and set of
        men, to another; but this is delivered from the Father to Christ, from
        Christ to his apostles, and by them to the saints; and "into which they
        were delivered", as it may be rendered, as into a mould; and so received
        the impression of it, and were evangelized by it: so such are who have a
        spirit of Gospel liberty, in opposition to a spirit of bondage; who live
        by faith on Christ, and not by the works of the law; who derive their
        comfort from him, and not from anything done by them; whose repentance
        and obedience are influenced by the grace of God, and who are zealous of
        good works, without any dependence on them. This form of doctrine was
        "obeyed" by them; by which is meant, not a mere obedience to the
        ordinances of the Gospel; nor a bare hearing of the doctrines of it, and
        giving an assent unto them; but an embracing of them by faith for
        themselves, so as to lay hold on Christ in them, submit to his
        righteousness therein revealed, and be willing to be saved by him, and
        him alone, in his own way; and this is the obedience of faith: the
        reason why faith is expressed by obedience is, because faith receives
        truth upon the veracity of God, and not upon the dictates of carnal
        reason; and is always more or less attended with external obedience to
        the will of God; and that is rightly performed only by faith. And this
        obedience did not lie in words, or proceed on mercenary views, and in an
        hypocritical way; but was "from the heart"; and was real and sincere:
        and good reason there is why a hearty, cheerful, and voluntary obedience
        should be yielded to t he Gospel; since it is from God; Christ is the
        substance of it; it is truth, and the word of our salvation. The
        Alexandrian copy reads, "from a pure heart"; and the Arabic version,
        "from the sincerity of your heart"; and the Ethiopic version, "with your
        whole heart".

      Being then made free from sin,.... Not from a sinful nature; nor from a
      corrupt heart; nor from vain thoughts; nor from sinful words; nor from
      sinful actions altogether; but from the damning power of sin: sin brought
      all men under a sentence of condemnation; Christ has bore the execution of
      this sentence in himself for his people; hence, as considered in him, they
      are free from it; and such as are born again have passed from death to
      life, and shall never enter into condemnation: likewise, such persons are
      free from the guilt of sin; men are in a legal sense arraigned for sin,
      accused of it, and being convicted, are pronounced guilty before God; and
      awakened souls have a sense of it in themselves; but the blood of Christ
      sprinkled on their consciences frees them from it; though fresh sins
      committed bring fresh guilt, which requires the continual application of
      the blood of Jesus for pardon and cleansing: but what is chiefly designed
      here is freedom from the servitude of sin, as appears from the context.
      Now God's elect are not released voluntarily by their former masters; nor
      is their freedom obtained by their own power and will; but it is of God,
      Father, Son, and Spirit; and the Gospel is generally the means of it, and
      happy are those persons who are blessed with it! They are rid of a bad
      master; are freed from the worst of bondage; will be no more servants, as
      before; are delivered from the power, and out of the kingdom of darkness;
      are heirs of heaven, and shall enjoy the glorious liberty of the children
      of God: and for the time present are
      <p></p>
      <p>
        become the servants of righteousness; servants to God, whose Gospel they
        obey; servants to Christ, whose righteousness they submit to; and
        servants to the law of righteousness, as held forth by Christ; they give
        up themselves to a course and life of righteousness, in which there are
        true honour, peace, and pleasure.

      I speak after the manner of men,.... This refers either to what the
      apostle had said already concerning service and liberty, things which were
      known among men, and easy to be understood; or to the following
      exhortation: what he was about to say, he delivered in a manner suited to
      their understandings, and was "that which was human"; not angelic, or what
      required the power, purity, and perfection of angels; or what was
      unreasonable or impossible, but what was their reasonable service, as men;
      and might be done through the grace of God, in the strength of Christ, and
      by the assistance of the Spirit: and though he might have insisted upon it
      with good reason, that they ought to be more diligent and industrious in
      the service of God than they had been in the service of sin; yet
      <p></p>
      <p>
        because of the infirmity of their flesh, considering that they had
        flesh, or corrupt nature, and were attended with weakness in knowledge,
        faith, and obedience; he only pressed this upon them, that in like
        manner as they had been servants to sin, they would be servants to
        righteousness:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness, and to
        iniquity unto iniquity; what they yielded to the service of sin were
        their "members"; by which, as before, may be meant, either the powers
        and faculties of their souls, or the parts and members of their bodies,
        or both; and particularly the latter, as the eyes and ears, the tongue,
        the mouth, the hands, and feet, which are all employed by a natural man
        in the drudgery of sin: these are yielded to sin under the form and
        character of "servants"; and as such are governed, directed, and ordered
        to fulfil this and the other lust, which is done willingly and readily:
        these members are "yielded", presented, and given up cheerfully to this
        slavery; which is both scandalous and unrighteous: it is "to
        uncleanness"; which designs all sorts of pollution and filthiness, both
        of flesh and spirit: "and to iniquity"; everything that is contrary to
        the law, all unrighteousness and ungodliness; and it is added, "unto
        iniquity"; which may design all sorts of sin, a progress in it, adding
        continually to it; which shows them to have been thorough hearty
        servants of sin. Now what the apostle exhorts to, and requires of them,
        is, that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        even so now they would yield their members servants to righteousness
        unto holiness; that is, let the same members that have been employed in
        the service of sin, be made use of in the service of righteousness: let
        your eyes be employed in looking and diligently searching into the
        Scriptures of truth; your ears in hearing the Gospel preached; your
        lips, mouth, and tongue, in expressing the praises of God, for what he
        has done for you; your hands in distributing to the interest of
        religion, and the necessities of the saints; and your feet in hastening
        to attend on public worship, and observe the testimonies of the Lord:
        let them be employed under the same form and character as servants,
        waiting upon the Lord, ready to fulfil his will; and in the same manner,
        freely, willingly, and cheerfully, and that constantly and universally,
        in all acts of righteousness and holiness.

      </p>
      For when ye were the servants of sin,.... This is an argument used, or a
      reason given, why regenerate persons should be diligent in the service of
      righteousness; because when they were employed in the drudgery of sin,
      they
      <p></p>
      <p>
        were free from righteousness; they had no righteousness, nor were they
        desirous of any; yea, averse to it, threw off the yoke of the law of
        righteousness, and lived in a very unrighteous manner: hence may be
        observed what is the free will of man in an unregenerate state; not free
        to, but "from" righteousness; free enough to evil, but from all that is
        good; and also what obligation lies upon believers, who are delivered
        from the bondage of corruption, and the servitude of sin, to a life and
        service of righteousness; inasmuch as they were before free from it, and
        unconcerned about it, but are now made by the grace of God free to it,
        they ought therefore cheerfully to pursue it, and neglect no opportunity
        of performing it.

      </p>
      What fruit had ye then in those things?.... That is, what profit,
      pleasure, satisfaction, or comfort, had ye in the commission of sin? Sin
      yields no real profit to the servants of it. If a man, by sinful
      practices, could amass together the riches of the Indies, or gain the
      whole world, yet if his soul is lost thereby, what advantage would it be
      to him? he would be infinitely the loser by it; nor would all his wealth
      and riches profit him in the day of God's wrath and righteous judgment:
      nor is there any true pleasure in sin; persons may imagine within
      themselves they enjoy a real pleasure whilst they are serving divers
      lusts; but this is but imaginary, it is not real; and this imaginary
      pleasure is but for a season; it issues in bitterness and death: nor is
      there any satisfaction in it; when men have endeavoured to gratify their
      carnal lusts and sensual appetites in every way that can be devised, they
      still remain as they were; nor can they reflect with real satisfaction,
      and without some slinging remorse, upon the methods they have pursued to
      gain it: nor is there any true honour in sin, nothing but what is
      scandalous and disgraceful to human nature; shame, sooner or later, is the
      fruit of sin:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whereof ye are now ashamed; some men may be indeed for the present so
        hardened as not to blush and be ashamed at the commission of the vilest
        sins; such are they who have no sense of sin, have no fear of God, or
        regard to men; and so sin openly, and without any guise, glory in it,
        and make their boast of it: but when persons are wrought upon by the
        Spirit of God, they are ashamed of sin; which might be exemplified in
        the case of Adam and Eve, of Ephraim, of the prodigal son, and of the
        poor publican; the reason is, because light is struck into their hearts;
        and this makes manifest the odious and detestable nature of sin; sin is
        hereby seen in its own proper colours, as exceeding sinful, loathsome,
        and abominable: besides, the grace and goodness of God are discovered in
        the forgiveness of it; and the glory of God's purity and holiness, and
        the beauty and loveliness of Christ, are discerned by such persons; all
        which have a tendency to make them ashamed of sin, out of love with it,
        and to abhor it: and a good thing it is to be brought to be ashamed of
        sin here; for such who are not ashamed of it here, shall be brought to
        everlasting shame and confusion hereafter. Nay, this is not all; not
        only shame will be the fruit of sin, but it will also issue in death:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for the, end of those things is death: the profit, the reward, and wages
        of them is death: sin not only brings a spiritual or moral death on
        persons, on all the powers and faculties of their souls, and is followed
        with a corporeal death; but if grace prevent not, it will end in an
        eternal one; for however right and good the ways of sin may seem to the
        carnal mind, "the end thereof are the ways of death" (#Pr 14:12 16:25).

      But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,.... In what
      sense regenerate persons are free from sin, and are become the servants of
      God, has been observed already; the consequence of which is, that such
      have their
      <p></p>
      <p>
        fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life: holiness is a fruit
        of freedom from the bondage of sin, and of serving God; holiness begun
        in regeneration, calling, and conversion, is a fruit of the Spirit; a
        course of living righteously is a fruit of holiness, as a principle
        implanted; a gradual increase in holiness is carried on by the Spirit of
        God in a course of righteousness; and a course of righteousness, from a
        principle of grace, issues in perfect holiness; "without which no man
        shall see the Lord"
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#014">Heb 12:14</a>: here it seems
        to design, that holiness is fruit, or that which is gain and profit to
        persons, in opposition to sin, in which there is no profit: it is not
        indeed profitable to God in point of merit; yet holiness, as a principle
        of grace, is profitable to the saints in point of meetness for glory;
        and holiness, as it denotes an external course of life, is useful and
        profitable on many accounts; hereby God is glorified, the doctrine of
        Christ is adorned, religion is honoured and recommended, our own credit,
        reputation, and peace, are preserved, and our neighbour's good promoted.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And the end is everlasting life: as sin issues, if grace prevent not, in
        everlasting death; holiness issues in eternal life, not by way of merit,
        but of free gift.

      For the wages of sin is death,.... By sin, is meant every sin, original
      sin, actual sin, every kind of sin, lesser and greater: the "death" which
      sin deserves, is a corporeal death; which is not owing to the original
      nature and constitution of men; nor merely to the divine appointment; but
      to sin, and the decree of God, on account of it; which is inflicted on
      Christless sinners, as a punishment for sin, though not on believers as
      such, because Christ has took away the sting and curse of it: a death of
      diseases and afflictions also follows upon sin, as its proper demerit;
      which are properly punishments to wicked men, and are occasioned by sin in
      believers: there is a death of the soul, which comes by sin, which lies in
      an alienation from God, in a loss of the image of God, and in a servitude
      to sin; and there is an eternal death, the just wages of sin, which lies
      in a separation of soul and body from God, and in a sense of divine wrath
      to all eternity; and which is here meant, as is clear from its antithesis,
      "eternal life", in the next clause. Now this is "the wages" of sin; sin
      does in its own nature produce it, and excludes from life; it is the
      natural issue of it; sin is committed against an infinite God, and
      righteously deserves such a death; it is its just wages by law. The Greek
      word signifies soldiers' wages; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#014">Luk 3:14</a> and in
      <p></p>

        "At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his nation, and spent much
        of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of his nation and gave
        them wages,'' (1 Maccabees 14:32)

        Sin is represented as a king, a mighty monarch, a tyrannical prince;
        sinners are his subjects and vassals, his servants and soldiers, who
        fight under him, and for him, and all the wages they must expect from
        him is death. So the word is interpreted in the Glossary, , "soldiers'
        wages"; and so it is used by the Jewish writers, being adopted into
        their language; of a king, they say (a), that he should not multiply to
        himself gold and silver more than to pay which they (b) interpret by ,
        "the hire of armies", or the wages of soldiers for a whole year, who go
        in and out with him all the year; so that it denotes wages due, and paid
        after a campaign is ended, and service is over; and, as here used,
        suggests, that when men have been all their days in the service of sin,
        and have fought under the banners of it, the wages they will earn, and
        the reward that will be given them, will be death: and it is frequently
        observed by the Jewish doctors (c), that , "there is no death without
        sin": sin is the cause of death, and death the fruit and effect of sin:

        but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        These words, at first sight, look as if the sense of them was, that
        eternal life is the gift of God through Christ, which is a great and
        glorious truth of the Gospel; but their standing in opposition to the
        preceding words require another sense, namely, that God's gift of grace
        issues in eternal life, through Christ: wherefore by "the gift of God"
        is not meant eternal life, but either the gift of a justifying
        righteousness, or the grace of God in regeneration and sanctification,
        or both, which issue in eternal life; the one is the saints' right and
        title, the other their meetness for it: so that as death is the wages of
        sin, and is what that issues in, and brings unto, eternal life is the
        effect of grace, or what the grace of God in justifying and sanctifying
        his people issues in; even a life free from all sorrow and imperfection;
        a life of the utmost perfection and pleasure, and which will last for
        ever: and as the grace of God, which justifies and sanctifies them, is
        "through Christ", so is the eternal life itself which it brings unto:
        this is in Christ, comes through his righteousness, sufferings, and
        death; is bestowed by him, and will greatly consist in the enjoyment of
        him. All grace is the gift of God, and is freely given, or otherwise it
        would not be grace; particularly the justifying righteousness of Christ
        is the gift of God; and the rather this may be meant here, since the
        apostle had been treating of it so largely before, and had so often, in
        the preceding chapter, called it the gift of righteousness, the free
        gift, and gift by grace, and justification by it, the justification of
        life, because it entitles to eternal life, as here: it may be said to
        issue in it; for between justification and glorification there is a sure
        and close connection; they that are justified by the righteousness of
        Christ, are certainly glorified, or enjoy eternal life; and though this
        may be principally intended here, yet is not to be understood to the
        exclusion of other gifts of grace, which have the same connection and
        issue: thus, for instance, faith is the gift of God, and not of a man's
        self, and he that has it, has eternal life, and shall, Or ever possess
        it; repentance is a free grace gift, it is a grant from the Lord, and it
        is unto life and salvation; and on whomsoever the grace of God is
        bestowed, so as to believe in Christ for righteousness, and truly repent
        of sin, these shall partake of eternal glory. It may be observed, that
        there is a just proportion between sin, and the wages of it, yet there
        is none between eternal life, and the obedience of men; and therefore
        though the apostle had been pressing so much obedience to God, and to
        righteousness, he does not make eternal life to be the fruit and effect
        of obedience, but of the gift of the grace of God.
