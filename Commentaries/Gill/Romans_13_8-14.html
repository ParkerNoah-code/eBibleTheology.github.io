      Owe no man anything,.... From the payment of dues to magistrates the
      apostle proceeds to a general exhortation to discharge all sorts of debts;
      as not to owe the civil magistrate any thing, but render to him his dues,
      so to owe nothing to any other man, but make good all obligations
      whatever, as of a civil, so of a natural kind. There are debts arising
      from the natural and civil relations subsisting among men, which should be
      discharged; as of the husband to the wife, the wife to the husband;
      parents to their children, children to their parents; masters to their
      servants, servants to their masters; one brother, friend, and neighbour,
      to another. Moreover, pecuniary debts may be here intended, such as are
      come into by borrowing, buying, commerce, and contracts; which though they
      cannot be avoided in carrying on worldly business, yet men ought to make
      conscience of paying them as soon as they are able: many an honest man may
      be in debt, and by one providence or another be disabled from payment,
      which is a grief of mind to him; but for men industriously to run into
      debt, and take no care to pay, but live upon the property and substance of
      others, is scandalous to them as men, and greatly unbecoming professors of
      religion, and brings great reproach upon the Gospel of Christ.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But to love one another. This is the only debt never to be wholly
        discharged; for though it should be always paying, yet ought always to
        be looked upon as owing. Saints ought to love one another as such; to
        this they are obliged by the new commandment of Christ, by the love of
        God, and Christ unto them, by the relations they stand in to one
        another, as the children of God, brethren, and members of the same body;
        and which is necessary to keep them and the churches of Christ together,
        it being the bond of perfectness by which they are knit to one another;
        and for their comfort and honour, as well as to show the truth and
        reality of their profession. This debt should be always paying; saints
        should be continually serving one another in love, praying for each
        other, bearing one another's burdens, forbearing each other, and doing
        all good offices in things temporal and spiritual that lie in their
        power, and yet always owing; the obligation to it always remains.
        Christ's commandment is a new one, always new, and will never be
        antiquated; his and his Father's love always continue, and the relations
        believers stand in to each other are ever the same; and therefore love
        will be always paying, and always owing in heaven to all eternity. But
        what the apostle seems chiefly to respect, is love to one another as
        men, love to one another, to the neighbour, as the following verses
        show. Love is a debt we owe to every man, as a man, being all made of
        one blood, and in the image of God; so that not only such as are of the
        same family, live in the same neighbourhood, and belong to the same
        nation, but even all the individuals of mankind, yea, our very enemies
        are to share in our love; and as we have an opportunity and ability, are
        to show it by doing them good.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law; that is, not who
        loves some one particular person, but every other person besides
        himself, even his neighbour, in the largest sense of the word, including
        all mankind, and that as himself; such an one has fulfilled the law, the
        law of the decalogue; that part of it particularly which relates to the
        neighbour; the second table of the law, as the next verse shows: though
        since there is no true love of our neighbour without the love of God,
        nor no true love of God without the love of our neighbour; and since
        these two involve each other, and include the whole law, it may be
        understood of fulfilling every part of it, that is, of doing it; for
        fulfilling the law means doing it, or acting according to it; and so far
        as a man loves, so far he fulfils, that is, does it: but this is not,
        nor can it be done perfectly, which is evident, partly from the
        impotency of man, who is weak and without strength, yea, dead in sin,
        and unable to do any thing of himself; and partly from the extensiveness
        of the law, which reaches to the thoughts and desires of the heart, as
        well as to words and actions; as also from the imperfection of love, for
        neither love to God, nor love to one another, either as men or
        Christians, is perfect; and consequently the fulfilling of the law by it
        is not perfect: hence this passage yields nothing in favour of the
        doctrine of justification by works; since the best works are imperfect,
        even those that spring from love, for love itself is imperfect; and are
        not done as they are, in a man's own strength, and without the Spirit
        and grace of God. Christ only has fulfilled the law perfectly, both as
        to parts and degrees; and to him only should we look for a justifying
        righteousness.

      </p>
      For this, thou shalt not commit adultery,.... The apostle here reckons up
      the several laws of the second table, with this view, that it might appear
      that so far as a man loves his neighbour, whether more near or distantly
      related, he fulfils the law, or acts according to it. He omits the first
      of these, the fifth commandment, either because he had urged this before,
      so far as it may be thought to regard magistrates; or because, according
      to the division of the Jews, who reckon five commands to each table, this
      belonged to the first: and he puts the seventh before the sixth, which is
      of no great moment; the order of things being frequently changed in the
      Scripture, and which is often done by Jewish writers, in alleging and
      citing passages of Scripture; and with whom this is a maxim, , "that there
      is no first nor last in the law" (c); that is, it is of no importance
      which stands first or last in it: it follows,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        thou shall not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false
        witness, thou shalt not covet; which are the sixth, eighth, ninth, and
        tenth commands of the decalogue (Exo 20:13)
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and if there be any other commandment; of God, respecting the neighbour,
        either in the decalogue, as there was the fifth (Exo 20:12) or elsewhere,
        the apostle repeating this by memory:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, thou shall love thy
        neighbour as thyself; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018">Lev 19:18</a>; this is the
        summary and epitome of them; so Christ reduces the laws of the first
        table to the head of love to God, and those of the second to the head of
        love to the neighbour (Mat 22:37) as the apostle
        does here, and in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014">Gal 5:14</a>, and the Apostle
        James, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008">Jam 2:8</a>.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      Love worketh no ill to his neighbour,.... That is, the man that truly
      loves his neighbour, will contrive no ill against him, nor do any to him;
      he will not injure his person, nor defile his bed, nor deprive or defraud
      him of his substance; or do hurt to his character, bear false testimony
      against him, or covet with an evil covetousness anything that is his; but,
      on the contrary, will do him all the good he is capable of:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        therefore love is the fulfilling of the law: so far as a man loves his
        neighbour, he acts agreeably to the law, and the particular precepts of
        it above mentioned: what the apostle says of love to the neighbour, the
        Jews frequently say of love to God;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "he that loveth God (they say (d)) , "hath fulfilled the decalogue",
        both above and below.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And again (e),</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "there is no service like the love of God, R. Abba saith it is , "the
        sum of the law"; for the ten words of the law , "are herein
        comprehended", or "fulfilled":''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and elsewhere (f) they observe,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"that , "the whole law is comprehended", or fulfilled "in love".''</p>

      And that knowing the time,.... That it is day and not night, the Gospel
      day, the day of salvation; in which the grace of God shines forth, like
      the sun in its meridian glory; life and immortality are brought to light,
      righteousness and salvation are revealed; and so a time not for sloth and
      sleep, but business; in which the saints should active in the exercise of
      grace, and discharge, of duty; owing no man anything but the debt of love;
      and that the dawn of grace, and day of spiritual light had broke in upon
      their souls, and dispelled the darkness of sin, ignorance and unbelief;
      that the darkness was past, and the true light shined, and the sun of
      righteousness was risen on them: all which they full well knew and were
      conscious of, and therefore should observe,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that now it is high time for us to awake out of sleep; since sleep is
        for the night, and not the day; the Alexandrian copy reads, "for you".
        This is to be understood, not of the dead sleep of sin, in which
        unconverted persons are, to be awoke out of which is a work of divine
        power; but of the carnal security and drowsy frame of spirit which
        sometimes attend the churches and children of God, the wise as well as
        the foolish virgins; and lies in grace being dormant in, the soul; in a
        backwardness to duty, and a slothfulness in the performance of it; in
        resting in the outward duties of religion; in lukewarmness about the
        cause of Christ; in an unconcernedness about sins of omission and
        commission; and in a willingness to continue in such a sluggish frame:
        all which arise from a body of sin and death, and an over anxious care
        for the things of the world; from a weariness in spiritual exercises,
        and an abstinence from spiritual company and ordinances and from outward
        peace and liberty: such a frame of spirit, when, it prevails and becomes
        general is of bad consequence to the churches of Christ; the spirit of
        discerning, care and diligence in receiving members, are in a great
        measure lost, and so they are filled with hypocrites and heretics;
        Christ absents himself from them; leanness of soul is brought upon them;
        and they are in danger of being surprised with the midnight cry: the
        methods God takes to awaken his people out of such a sleep are various;
        sometimes in a more gentle way, by the discoveries his love, which
        causes the lips of those that are asleep to speak; sometimes by severe
        reproofs in the ministry of the word; and sometimes by sharp
        persecutions in providence; and at last it will be done by the midnight
        cry: the argument, showing the reasonableness of awaking out of sleep,
        and that it was high time to do so, follows,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed; by which is
        meant, not temporal salvation, or a deliverance from the persecution the
        saints endured in Judea, from their own countrymen, by the departure of
        them from Jerusalem, a little before its destruction, by the destruction
        of that city, and the peaceful times of Vespasian; but a spiritual and
        eternal salvation: not Christ the author of it, who was come to effect
        it; nor that itself, as obtained, which was now done, finished, and
        completed; nor the application of it to their souls, which also had been
        made; but the consummate enjoyment of it in heaven, the salvation of
        their souls at death, and both of soul and body at the resurrection;
        consisting in a freedom from every evil, and in a full possession of all
        that is good and glorious: this is brought nearer to the saints, to
        their sight and view, as their faith grows and increases; and they are
        nearer the enjoyment of that than when they first believed; and which is
        a strong reason why a sluggish, slothful frame should not be indulged;
        what, sleep, and heaven so near at hand! just at their Father's house,
        ready to enter into the joy of their Lord, into his everlasting kingdom
        and glory, and yet asleep!

      The night is far spent,.... Not of Jewish darkness, which was gone, and
      was succeeded by the Gospel day; nor of former ignorance in Gentilism and
      unregeneracy, for that was past, and the true light shined; much less of
      security in the latter day, which was not yet come on; rather of
      persecution and distress for Christ's sake; but it is best of all to
      understand it of the present time of life; so it is called by the Jews
      (g), , "this world is like to the night": and which, in the best of
      saints, is attended with imperfection and darkness, errors and mistakes,
      in principle and practice, in doctrine and conversation; however, it is
      far spent, and in a little time will be over:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the day is at hand; not the Gospel day, for that was already come; nor
        the day of grace, and spiritual light and comfort to their souls, for
        that also had taken place; nor the latter day glory, which then was at a
        distance; rather the approaching day of deliverance from present
        persecutions; but it is much better to understand it of the everlasting
        day of glory, which to particular persons was then, and now is at hand;
        a little while, and the night of darkness, affliction, and
        disconsolation will be over, and the day of glory will succeed, when
        there will be no more night, no more darkness, no more doubts, fears,
        and unbelief; but one continued series of light, joy, and comfort, and
        an uninterrupted communion with Father, Son, and Spirit; and which is
        another reason why the saints should not indulge themselves in sleep,
        but be active, since the halcyon days are at hand, as well as a reason
        why they should attend to the following exhortations:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        let us therefore cast off the works of darkness; as the apostle had made
        use of the metaphors of night and day, and of sleep, and awaking out of
        sleep, and rising in the morning to business, so he continues the same;
        and here alludes to persons throwing off their bed clothes, and covering
        of the night, and putting on proper raiment for the day. By "works of
        darkness" are meant evil works, which are opposite to the light; to God,
        who is light itself; to Christ, the light of the world; to the word of
        God, both law and Gospel, which is a light to our paths; to both the
        light of nature, and the light of grace: and which spring from the
        darkness of the mind, and are encouraged to by the god of this world,
        and by his angels, the rulers of the darkness of it; and which are
        generally done in the dark, and are such as will not bear the light;
        and, if grace prevent not, will end in outer darkness, in blackness of
        darkness, reserved by the justice of God, as the punishment of them.
        "Casting them off" expresses a dislike of them, a displicency with them,
        and an abstinence from them. Some copies read, "the armour of darkness",
        which agrees with what follows:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and let us put on the armour of light; the whole armour of God, the use
        of which lies in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty;
        particularly good works are designed here, which though they are not the
        believer's clothing, his robe of justifying righteousness, they are both
        his ornament and his armour; by which he adorns the doctrine of Christ,
        and defends his own character and principles against the charges find
        calumnies of then: these being performed aright, spring from the light
        of grace in a regenerate man, and are such as will bear the light to be
        seen of men; and are the lights which are to shine before men, that they
        beholding them, may glorify God; so virtue was by Antisthenes (h),
        called , "armour which cannot be taken away": the allusion is thought to
        be to the bright and glittering armour of the Romans; the Alexandrian
        copy reads, "the words of light".

      Let us walk honestly as in the day,.... Being under the day of the Gospel
      dispensation, and the day of grace having dawned, and the daystar of
      spiritual light and knowledge being risen in our hearts, and we being
      exposed to the view of all men in broad daylight, ought not to lie down
      and sleep, but to arise and be active, and walk decently with the armour
      of light on us, as becomes the Gospel of Christ; not naked and unclothed,
      which would expose us and the Gospel to shame and contempt:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not in rioting; the Syriac and Arabic versions read, "in singing", or
        "songs"; meaning lewd ones, sung at riotous feasts and banquets, made
        not for refreshment, but for pleasure and debauchery, what the Romans
        (i) call "comessations"; feasts after supper in the night season, and
        design all sorts of nocturnal revels: "Comus", the word here used, is
        with the Heathens the god of feasts, perhaps the same with "Chemosh",
        the god of the Moabites,

      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not in chambering; in unlawful copulations, fornication, adultery, and
        all the defilements of the bed:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and wantonness; lasciviousness, unnatural lusts, as sodomy, &amp;c.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not in strife and envying; contention and quarrels, which are usually
        the consequences of luxury and uncleanness.

      But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ,.... As a man puts on his clothes when
      he rises in the morning: the righteousness of Christ is compared to a
      garment, it is the best robe, it is fine linen, clean and white, and
      change of raiment; which being put on by the Father's gracious act of
      imputation, covers the sins and deformities of his people, defends them
      from divine justice, secures them from wrath to come, and renders them
      beautiful and acceptable in his sight: which righteousness being revealed
      from faith to faith, is received by faith, and made use of as a proper
      dress to appear in before God; and may be daily said to be put on by the
      believer, as often as he makes use of it, and pleads it with God as his
      justifying righteousness, which should be continually: moreover, to put on
      Christ, and which indeed seems to be the true sense of the phrase here, is
      not only to exercise faith on him as the Lord our righteousness, and to
      make a profession of his name, but to imitate him in the exercise of grace
      and discharge of duty; to walk as he walked, and as we have him for an
      example, in love, meekness, patience, humility, and holiness:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and make not provision for the flesh; the body: not but that due care is
        to be taken of it, both for food and clothing; and for its health, and
        the continuance and preservation of it by all lawful methods; but not so
        as
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to fulfil the lusts thereof; to indulge and gratify them, by luxury and
        uncleanness: it is a saying of Hillell (k), "he that increases flesh,
        increases worms"; the sense his commentators (l) give of it is, that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "he that increases by eating and drinking, until he becomes fat and
        fleshy, increases for himself worms in the grave:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the design of the sentence is, that voluptuous men, who care for nothing
        else but the flesh, should consider, that ere long they will be a repast
        for worms: we should not provide, or be caterers for the flesh; and, by
        pampering it, stir up and satisfy its corrupt inclinations and desires.
