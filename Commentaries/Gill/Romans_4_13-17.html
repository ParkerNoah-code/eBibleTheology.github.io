      For the promise that he should be heir of the world,.... This promise is
      thought by some to refer to that of his being "the father of many
      nations",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004">Gen 17:4</a>; by whom the
      Gentiles are particularly meant, who are sometimes called "the world", and
      "the whole world", or the elect of God, the believing part of the world;
      whether among Jews or Gentiles, who sometimes go by the name of "the
      world" in Scripture: but to this it may be objected, that the promise here
      spoken of is made to Abraham's seed, as well as to himself; by which is
      meant not the Messiah, who is indeed heir of the world, and all things in
      it, but all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles; as appears from
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016">Rom 4:16</a>; and therefore
      cannot be both heirs and inheritance too. Others think the land of Canaan
      is designed, and by a synecdoche, a part of the world is put for the whole
      world; but that land is never so called, and, besides, the promise of it
      belonged to those of the law, and to them only, contrary to what the
      apostle argues, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014">Rom 4:14</a>.
      Others therefore consider Canaan as a type of heaven, which Abraham and
      his spiritual seed are heirs of by promise. But rather, by "the world"
      here, is meant, both this world and that which is to come; Abraham and all
      believers are the "heirs" of this world, and of all things in it; "all
      things" are theirs, and, among the rest, the world, Christ being theirs,
      and they being Christ's; he is heir of all things, and they are joint
      heirs with him; and how little soever they may enjoy of it now, the time
      is coming, when they, by virtue of their right, "shall inherit the earth";
      see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#009">Psa 37:9</a>; and now they
      have as much of it as is necessary, and with a blessing, and which the
      Jews call their "world". It is a saying in their Talmud (o), , "thou shall
      see thy world" in thy lifetime; which the gloss explains, "thou shalt
      find", or enjoy all thy necessities, or what is needful for thee; and of
      Abraham they say (p), that
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "he was the foundation of the world, and that for his sake the world was
        created;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and introduce God saying of him thus (q).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "as I am the only one in my world, so he is the only one, "in his
        world".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And as he and all the saints are heirs of this world, so of the world to
        come, the future salvation, the inheritance incorruptible, undefiled,
        never fading, and reserved in the heavens; for they are heirs of God
        himself, and shall inherit all things: now this large and comprehensive
        promise, which takes in the things of time and eternity,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        was not to Abraham, or to his seed through the law: not through the law
        of circumcision, or on the score of their obedience to that, for this
        promise was made before that was enjoined; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#002">Gen 12:2</a>; nor through the
        law of Moses, which was not as yet given; nor through the law of nature,
        nor by any righteousness of the law;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but through the righteousness of faith: by virtue of which they have
        "all things that pertain to life and godliness",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#003">Pe2 1:3</a>; and have "the
        promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008">Ti1 4:8</a>; enjoy with a
        blessing what they now have, and have a right and title to the heavenly
        glory.
      </p>

      For if they which are of the law be heirs,.... That is, if the Jews who
      are under the law, and are seeking for righteousness and life by the works
      of it, should, on the account of their obedience to it, be heirs of the
      grace of life and of glory,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        faith is made void; for if the right to the inheritance is by the works
        of the law, there is no room for faith; that can be of no use or
        service;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the promise made of none effect: if salvation is by works, it is to
        no purpose for God to promise, or men to believe; for the thing promised
        depends not upon God's promise, but upon man's obedience to the law; and
        if that is not perfectly observed, as it cannot possibly be, then the
        promise of God stands for nothing, and is in course made void. The
        apostle here argues from the absurdities which follow upon the doctrine
        of justification by works, as he does from the different effects of the
        law, in the following verse.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#015">Romans 4:15</a>

      </p>
      Because the law worketh wrath,.... Not the wrath of man, though that is
      sometimes stirred up through the prohibitions of the law, to which the
      carnal mind of man is enmity, but the wrath of God the law is so far from
      justifying sinners, that it curses and condemns them; and when it comes
      into the heart and is let into the conscience of a sinner, it fills with
      terrible apprehensions of the wrath of God, and a fearful looking for of
      his judgment and fiery indignation:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for where no law is, there is no transgression; (r); a sort of a
        proverbial expression: had the law of Moses not been given, there was
        the law of nature which sin is a transgression of; but the law of Moses
        was added for the better discovery and detection of sin, which would not
        have been so manifest without it, and which may be the apostle's sense;
        that where there is no law, there is no knowledge of any transgression;
        and so the Ethiopic version reads the words, "if the law had not come,
        there would have been none who would have known sin"; but the law is
        come, and there is a law by which is the knowledge of sin, and therefore
        no man can be justified by it; since that convinces him of sin, and
        fills him with a sense of divine wrath on account of it.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace,.... Meaning either the
      promise of being heir of the world, or the inheritance itself, or adoption
      which gives heirship, or remission of Sin, or the blessing of
      justification, either and all of these are of faith; not as the cause or
      condition of them, but as the means of God's fixing and appointing to be
      the recipient of all and each of them: which is done, "that it might be by
      grace"; appear to be of the free grace and favour of God, as each of these
      blessings are: forasmuch as every blessing is received by faith, it is
      manifest it must be by grace; since faith itself is a gift of God's grace,
      and lies purely in receiving favours at the hand of God, to whom it gives
      all the glory of them: and this is done with a further view,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed. The promise of the
        above blessings, particularly of the inheritance which is made in the
        covenant of grace, ordered in all things and sure, and which could not
        be disannulled by the law that came after it; this being by faith and of
        grace, and not of works, nor at all depending upon them, becomes sure to
        all believers, to all Abraham's spiritual seed:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not to that only which is of the law; to the Jews, who are said to be of
        the law, in distinction to the Gentiles who were without it; and designs
        such of them as were believers in Christ, and to whom the Gospel was the
        power of God unto salvation; to these the promise was, and was sure, and
        not to them only:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; to the Gentiles, who
        though they are not by natural descent from Abraham, yet are of the same
        faith with him, and so are his seed in a spiritual sense:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who is the father of us all; whether Jews or Gentiles, who are Christ's,
        and so Abraham's spiritual seed, and heirs of eternal life, according to
        the free promise of grace.

      </p>
      As it is written I have made thee a father of many nations,.... The
      passage referred to, is in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004">Gen 17:4</a>; which proves him
      to be a father not of the Jews only, since they cannot be called "many
      nations", but of the Gentiles also; and which must be understood in a
      spiritual sense, for Abraham was the father of them,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        before him whom he believed, even God; that is, he was so, either in the
        sight of God, who sees not as man sees; in his account, he was the
        father of many nations, long before he really in fact was; or "over
        against" or "like unto him", as the word may signify: as God was the
        Father of many nations, so was Abraham, though not in such a sense as he
        is; and as God is the Father of us all that believe, so was Abraham;
        there is some little likeness and resemblance in this between them,
        though not sameness. The object of his faith is described as he,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who quickeneth the dead: meaning either the dead body of Abraham and
        Sarah's womb; or Isaac, who was given up for dead; or the Gentiles, who
        were dead in trespasses and sins; or rather the dead bodies of men at
        the last day, a work which none but the almighty God can effect; the
        consideration of which is sufficient to engage faith in the promises of
        God, and a dependence on him for the fulfilment or them: and who stands
        further described as he, who
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        calleth those things which be not, as though they were; so he called
        Abraham the father of many nations, when he was not in fact, as if he
        really was; and the Gentiles his seed and offspring, before they were;
        and when he comes effectually to call them by his grace, they are
        represented as "things which are not", whom he called, "to bring to
        nought things that are",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#028">Co1 1:28</a>; they were not
        his people, nor his children, and he called them so, and by his grace
        made them so, and made them appear to be so; for as in creation so in
        regeneration, God calls and brings that into being which before was not:
        and the phrase seems to be an allusion to the creation of all things out
        of nothing; and it is a Rabbinical one, for so the Jews speaking of the
        creation say (s).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Nya la arwq, "he calls to that which is not", and it is excluded; (i.e.
        all things are excluded out of it, as a chicken out of an egg;) and to
        that which is, and it is established, and to the world, and it is
        stretched out.''
