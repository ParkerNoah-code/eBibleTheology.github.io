      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The Apostle having clearly stated, and fully proved the doctrine of
        justification by the righteousness of faith, proceeds to observe the
        comfortable fruits and effects of this great blessing, known and enjoyed
        by the believer; as also the source and spring of it, the love of God,
        which appears in the death of Christ, in the room and stead of his
        people, which is the foundation on which it stands; and likewise gives
        an illustration of this benefit, by comparing the two heads, Adam and
        Christ, together. The first fruit and effect of justification, as a
        benefit perceived and enjoyed by faith, is peace with God through
        Christ,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001">Rom 5:1</a>. The next is
        access through the Mediator to the throne of grace, where justified ones
        stand with a holy boldness and confidence, and the third is a cheerful
        hope of eternal glory,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#002">Rom 5:2</a>, yea, such not
        only have joy in the hope of what is to come, but glory even in present
        afflictions; which prevents an objection that might be made to the above
        mentioned fruits and effects of justification, taken from the
        tribulations which saints are exercised with: and what occasions
        glorying even in these, is the sanctified use, or happy produce of
        afflictions, these being the means of exercising and increasing
        patience; by means of which a larger experience of divine things is
        gained; and through that, hope is confirmed, and all influenced by a
        plenteous discovery of the love of God to the soul, by the Spirit,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004">Rom 5:4</a>, an instance of
        which love is given,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#006">Rom 5:6</a>, in Christ's dying
        for men; which love is enhanced by the character and condition of the
        persons for whom Christ died, being ungodly, and without strength; and
        by the time of it, being due time: then follows a further illustration
        of this love, by comparing it with what instances of love are to be
        found among men, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#007">Rom 5:7</a>,
        by which it appears to be unparalleled; since scarcely for a righteous
        man, peradventure for a good man, one would die, yet no man dies for the
        ungodly, as Christ did: hence as his, so his Father's love is highly
        commended, by giving him up to death for persons while in such a state
        and condition, and under such a character,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008">Rom 5:8</a>, and justification
        now springing from this love, and being founded on the death of Christ,
        hence follow a security from wrath to come,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#009">Rom 5:9</a>, a certainty of
        salvation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</a>, which
        is strongly argued from the different characters those Christ died for
        bear, before and after reconciliation, and from the death to the life of
        Christ, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</a>, and also
        a rejoicing and glorying: in God through Christ, full expiation being
        made by his blood for sin, and this received by faith,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011">Rom 5:11</a>, and then the
        apostle proceeds to compare the two heads, Adam and Christ, together;
        the design of which is to show the largeness and freeness of the love
        and grace of God; how righteousness for justification comes by Christ;
        and how the persons, before described as sinners and ungodly, came to be
        in such a condition; and that is through the sin of the first man, in
        whom they all were, and in whom they all sinned and died,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012">Rom 5:12</a>, wherefore there
        must be a law before the law of Moses, or there could have been no sin,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#013">Rom 5:13</a>, but that sin was
        in being, and was reckoned and imputed to the posterity of Adam, is
        clear from this single instance, death's power even over infants, from
        the times of Adam to Moses,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014">Rom 5:14</a> who therefore
        must be a public head, representing all his posterity; so that they were
        involved in the guilt of his sin, which brought death upon them; and in
        this he was a type of Christ, as is asserted in the same verse; that so
        as Adam was but one, and by one sin of his conveyed death to all his
        seed; so Christ, the Mediator, is but one, and by his one obedience
        conveys righteousness and, life to all his seed: and yet in some things
        there is a dissimilitude; sin and death, through the first man, are
        conveyed in a natural way to his offspring, but righteousness and life
        from Christ in a way of grace,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015">Rom 5:15</a>, It was one
        offence of Adam's, which brought condemnation and death upon all his
        posterity; but the righteousness of Christ is not only a justification
        of his seed from that one offence, but from all others,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#016">Rom 5:16</a>, the one is unto
        death, the other unto life; and greater is the efficacy in the one to
        quicken, than in the other to kill,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017">Rom 5:17</a>, where a
        repetition is made of what is said in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015">Rom 5:15</a>, with an
        explanation, and the similitude between the two heads is clearly
        expressed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#018">Rom 5:18</a>, where
        condemnation on account of the sin of Adam, and justification through
        the righteousness of Christ, are opposed to each other; and both as
        extending to the whole of their several respective offspring,
        condemnation through Adam's offence to all his natural seed, and
        justification of life through Christ's righteousness to all his
        spiritual seed; which is still more fitly and clearly expressed in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#019">Rom 5:19</a>, where the way
        and manner in which the one become sinners, and the other righteous, is
        plainly directed to; that it is, by the imputation of Adam's
        disobedience to the one, and by the imputation of Christ's righteousness
        to the other: in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020">Rom 5:20</a>,
        an objection is obviated, which might be formed thus; if justification
        is by the grace of God, and through the obedience and righteousness of
        Christ, then the law is of no use; what purpose does that serve? what
        occasion was there for its entrance? The apostle replies, that though
        justification is not by it, yet a good end is answered by its entrance;
        for hereby sin is more known to be what it is, both original and actual;
        and the grace of God appears more abundant in justification from it, and
        in the pardon of it; and this grace is further illustrated in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021">Rom 5:21</a>, by comparing sin
        and grace together, and the different effects of their empire over the
        sons of men; the one reigning unto death, the other reigning through
        righteousness to eternal life by Christ.

      </p>
      Therefore being justified by faith,.... Not that faith is at the first of
      our justification; for that is a sentence which passed in the mind of God
      from all eternity, and which passed on Christ, and on all the elect
      considered in him, when he rose from the dead; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025">Rom 4:25</a>; nor is it the
      chief, or has it the chief place in justification; it is not the efficient
      cause of it, it is God that justifies, and not faith; it is not the moving
      cause of it, that is the free grace of God; it is not the matter of it,
      that is the righteousness of Christ: we are not justified by faith, either
      as God's work in us, for, as such, it is a part of sanctification; nor as
      our work or act, as exercised by us, for then we should be justified by
      works, by something of our own, and have whereof to glory; but we are
      justified by faith objectively and relatively, as that relates to the
      object Christ, and his righteousness; or as it is a means of our
      knowledge, and perception of our justification by Christ's righteousness,
      and of our enjoying the comfort of it; and so we come to
      <p></p>
      <p>
        have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. The apostle having
        set the doctrine of justification in a clear light, and fully proved
        that it is not by the works of men, but by the righteousness of God; and
        having mentioned the several causes of it, proceeds to consider its
        effects, among which, peace with God stands in the first place; and is
        so called, to distinguish it from peace with men, which persons, though
        justified by faith in Christ's righteousness, may not have; but are
        sure, having a sense of this, to find peace with God, even with him
        against whom they have sinned, whose law they have transgressed, and
        whose justice they have affronted; reconciliation for sin being made,
        and a justifying righteousness brought in, and this imputed and applied
        to them, they have that "peace of God", that tranquillity and serenity
        of mind, the same with "peace with God" here, "which passes all
        understanding", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007">Phi 4:7</a>;
        and is better experienced than expressed: and this is all through our
        Lord Jesus Christ; it springs from his atoning sacrifice, and precious
        blood, by which he has made peace; and is communicated through the
        imputation of his righteousness, and the application of his blood; and
        is only felt and enjoyed in a way of believing, by looking to him as the
        Lord our righteousness.

      </p>
      By whom also we have access by faith,.... The access here spoken of is not
      to the blessing of justification; for though that is a grace which we have
      access to by Christ, and come at the knowledge of by faith, and enjoy the
      comfort of through it; and is a grace in which persons stand, and from
      which they shall never fall, and lays a solid foundation for rejoicing in
      hope of eternal glory; yet this sense would make the apostle guilty of a
      great tautology; and besides, he is not speaking of that blessing itself,
      but of its effects; and here of one distinct from "peace with God", before
      mentioned, as the word also manifestly shows: nor does it design any other
      blessing of grace, as pardon, adoption, sanctification, &amp;c. and an
      access thereunto; not unto the free grace, favour, and good will of God,
      the source of all blessings; but to the throne of grace, which may be
      called
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that grace, because of its name, for God, as the God of all grace, sits
        upon it; it is an high favour to be admitted to it; it is grace persons
        come thither for, and which they may expect to find there: and
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>in, or "at"</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which we stand; which denotes boldness, courage, and intrepidity, and a
        freedom from a servile fear and bashful spirit, and a continued constant
        attendance at it; all which is consistent with reverence, humility, and
        submission to the will of God. Now access to the throne of grace, and
        standing at that, are "by" Christ. There is no access to God in our own
        name and righteousness, and upon the foot of our own works. Christ is
        the only way of access to God, and acceptance with him; he is the
        Mediator between God and us; he introduces into his Father's presence,
        gives audience at his throne, and renders both persons and services
        acceptable unto him: and this access is also "by faith"; and that both
        in God the Father, as our covenant God and Father; in faith of interest
        in his love and favour; believing his power and faithfulness, his
        fulness and sufficiency, and that he is a God hearing and answering
        prayer: and also in the Lord Jesus Christ; in his person for acceptance;
        in his righteousness for justification; in his blood for pardon; and in
        his fulness for every supply: and such as have access to the throne of
        grace by faith in Christ, being comfortably persuaded of their
        justification before God, through his righteousness imputed to them, can
        and do
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        rejoice in hope of the glory of God; which is another effect of
        justification by faith: by the "glory of God"; which is another effect
        of justification by faith: by the "glory of God", is not meant the
        essential glory of God; nor that which we ought to seek in all that we
        are concerned, and which we are to ascribe unto him on the account of
        his perfections and works; but that everlasting glory and happiness
        which he has prepared for his people, has promised to them, and has
        called them to by Christ, and will bestow upon them; of which he has
        given them a good hope through grace; and in the hope and believing
        views of which they can, and do rejoice, even amidst a variety of
        afflictions and tribulations in this world. The Vulgate Latin version
        reads, "in hope of the glory of the children of God"; eternal glory
        being proper to them.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003">Romans 5:3</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="margnote"

            ><a name="an_003">rom 5:3</a></font
          ></span
        >
      </p>
      And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also,.... The tribulations
      of the saints are many and various, through the hatred of the world, the
      temptations of Satan, their own corruptions; and are the will of their
      heavenly Father; what Christ has foretold, and they expect; and here
      particularly design such as are for Christ's sake, which being supported
      under, and carried through, they glory in: not that these are desirable in
      themselves, and to the flesh; but they glory in them as they are for
      Christ's sake, and in a good cause; as they are trials of grace, and of
      use for the exercise of it: and as they are in the exercise of grace,
      amidst these tribulations, and are comforted under them, and are helped to
      have regard to the heavenly glory. The ground of which glorying is, that
      these afflictions are the means of promoting patience, experience, and
      hope:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        knowing this, that tribulation worketh patience; patience is a grace, of
        which God is the author; it is one of the fruits of the Spirit; the word
        of God is the means of its being first implanted; and afflictions are
        the means of promoting it, when they are sanctified; otherwise they
        produce impatience, murmurings, and repinings; there is great need of
        patience under them; and, by divine grace, they are the matter and
        occasion of exercising, and so of increasing it.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#004">Romans 5:4</a>

          ></span
        >
      </p>
      And patience experience,.... As tribulations tend to exercise and increase
      patience, so patience being exercised and increased, enlarges the saints'
      stock and fund of experience; of the love and grace of God communicated to
      them at such seasons; of his faithfulness in fulfilling his promises; of
      his power in supporting them; and of their own frailty and weakness; and
      so are taught humility, thankfulness, and resignation to the will of God:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and experience, hope; hope is a gift of God's grace, and is implanted in
        regeneration, but abounds, increases, and becomes more strong and lively
        by experience of the love, grace, mercy, power, and faithfulness of God.

          ></span
        >
      </p>
      And hope maketh not ashamed,.... As a vain hope does, things not answering
      to expectation, it deceives, and is lost; but the grace of hope is of such
      a nature, as that it never fails deceives, or disappoints: it neither
      makes ashamed, nor have persons that have any reason to be ashamed of it;
      neither of the grace itself, which is a good one; nor of the ground and
      foundation of it, the person and righteousness of Christ; nor of the
      object of it, eternal glory:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost,
        which is given unto us. By "the love of God" is meant, not that love by
        which we love God, for hope does not depend upon, nor is it supported by
        our love and obedience to God; but the love of God to us, of which some
        instances are given in the following verses: us is said "to be shed
        abroad in our hearts"; which denotes the plenty and abundance of it, and
        the full and comfortable sensation which believers have of it: "by the
        Holy Spirit": who leads into, and makes application of it: "and is given
        to us": for that purpose, as the applier of all grace, the Comforter,
        and the earnest of heaven. Now the love which the Spirit sheds abroad in
        the heart, is the source and spring, both of justification itself, which
        is owing to the free grace of God, and of all the effects of it, as
        peace with God, access to the throne of grace, rejoicing in hope of the
        glory of God, the usefulness of afflictions, and the stability of hope,
        and is here alleged as the reason of all.

      </p>
      For when we were yet without strength,.... The apostle having mentioned
      the love of God proceeds to give an instance, and which is a full proof
      and demonstration of it, which is, that
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in due time Christ died for the ungodly. That Christ died is certain;
        the death of Christ was foretold in prophecy, typified by the sacrifices
        of slain beasts, was spoken of by himself, both before and since his
        death; his enemies have never denied it; and this was the sum of the
        ministry of the apostles, and is the great article of faith: and that
        the death of Christ is a singular instance of the love of God, is
        evident by considering the person that died, the Son of God in human
        nature, his own, his only begotten Son, his beloved Son; the concern
        which God had in it, by willing, ordering, and appointing it, awaking
        the sword of justice against him, not sparing him, but delivering him up
        for us all; also the nature, kind, and manner of his death, and
        particularly the persons for whom he died, here described: he "died for
        the ungodly"; not for himself, he had no sins of his own to die for, nor
        did he want any happiness to procure; nor for angels, but for men; and
        these not holy, just, and good men, but ungodly; and not as a mere
        martyr, or only by way of example to them, and so for their good; but as
        the Syriac version reads it, , "in the room", or "stead of the ungodly",
        as their surety to make satisfaction for their sins. The Jews have a
        notion of the Messiah's being a substitute, and standing in the place
        and stead of sinners; and they say (x),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that Aaron filled up the place of the first Adam, and was brought near
        in the room of him;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which is true of Christ, the antitype of Aaron. On those words, "I will
        give a man for thee",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#004">Isa 43:4</a>; the doctors (y)
        say,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "do not read Adam, but Edom; for when God removes the decree (or
        punishment) from a particular man, he provides for the attribute of
        justice in the room of the man that sinned, , "another man that comes
        from Edom";''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        referring, as I think, to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001">Isa 63:1</a>. And this their
        character of ungodly shows, that not goodness in man, but love in God,
        was the moving cause of Christ's dying for them; and that the end of his
        dying was to atone for their ungodliness: and to illustrate the love of
        God the more towards them in this instance, they are said to be "without
        strength" at that time; being so enfeebled by sin, that they were not
        capable of fulfilling the law, of atoning for the transgressions of it,
        of redeeming themselves from slavery, of beginning and carrying on a
        work of holiness their hearts, nor indeed of doing one good thing. Add
        to all this, that Christ died for these persons in due time; in the most
        fit, proper, and convenient season to illustrate the love and grace of
        God; when man appeared both weak and wicked; when the weakness of the
        legal dispensation had been sufficiently evinced, and the wickedness of
        man, both among Jews and Gentiles, was at a very great height: or rather
        by "due time" is meant the "fulness of time",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004">Gal 4:4</a>; the time
        appointed in council by God, agreed to by Christ, and fixed in prophecy;
        before the departure of the sceptre from Judah, the destruction of the
        second temple, and at the close of Daniel's weeks.

      For scarcely for a righteous man will one die,.... The design of this, and
      the following verse, is to show that Christ's dying for ungodly persons is
      an instance of kindness that is matchless and unparalleled. By "a
      righteous man", is not meant a truly gracious, holy man; nor one that is
      made righteous by the obedience of Christ; but one that is so in his own
      eyes, and in the esteem of others, being outwardly moral and righteous
      before men; who keeps to the letter of the law, and does, as he imagines,
      what that externally requires: such were the Pharisees among the Jews,
      who, though they were had in much outward esteem and veneration among the
      people, yet were rather feared than loved; and it would have been a
      difficult thing to have found a person that would cheerfully venture, and
      lay down his life for any of that complexion and cast:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. By "a good
        man", is not meant a man made so by the grace of God, and who is indeed
        truly and properly the only good man; but a liberal and beneficent man,
        who was very bountiful in his charitable distributions to the poor, and
        very liberal in contributing towards the charge of sacrifices, repairs
        of the temple, &amp;c. and did more this way than what the law obliged
        to. Now for such a man perhaps there might be some found so daring and
        hardy, as to venture and lay down their lives, when there was any danger
        of his, or any necessity for so doing; so great an interest such men had
        in the affections of the people. And so the Jews (z) distinguish between
        "a righteous man", and "a good man". They say (a),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "there is a righteous man that is good, and there is a righteous man
        that is not good; but he that is good for heaven, and the creatures,
        i.e. for God and men, this is , "a righteous good man"; but he that is
        good to God, and evil to men, this is , "a righteous man that is not
        good".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The whole body of the people of the Jews were divided into three sorts:
        take a short sentence out of their Talmud (b), not to support the
        justness of the characters, but for the sake of this threefold division
        of the people:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "three things are said concerning the paring of the nails, "a righteous
        man" buries them, "a good man" burns them, "a wicked man" casts them
        away.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Now to this division of the people the apostle alludes; and there is in
        the words a beautiful gradation, scarcely for one of the "righteous
        men", who does just what he is obliged to do by the law, and no more,
        will any die; perhaps it may be, that for one of "the good men", who are
        very liberal to the poor, and towards defraying all the expenses of the
        temple service, in which they exceed the strict demands of the law, some
        may be found willing to die; but who will die for the "the wicked and
        ungodly", the profligate and abandoned part of the people? not one, but
        Christ died for the ungodly: wherefore if instances could be produced of
        men's dying either for righteous men, or good men, these would not come
        up to the instance of Christ's dying for men, who were neither righteous
        nor good.

      But God commendeth his love towards us,.... That is, he hath manifested
      it, which was before hid in his heart; he has given clear evidence of it,
      a full proof and demonstration of it; he has so confirmed it by this
      instance, that there is no room nor reason to doubt of it; he has
      illustrated and set it off with the greater lustre by this circumstance of
      it,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. God's elect were
        sinners in Adam, in whom they were naturally and federally, as all
        mankind were; hence polluted and guilty; and so they are in their own
        persons whilst unregenerate: they are dead in sin, and live in it,
        commit it, are slaves unto it, and are under the power and dominion of
        it; and many of them are the chief and vilest of sinners; and such they
        were considered when Christ died for them: but are not God's people
        sinners after conversion? yes; but sin has not the dominion over them;
        their life is not a course of sinning, as before; and besides, they are
        openly justified and pardoned, as well as renewed, and sanctified, and
        live in newness of life; so that their characters now are taken, not
        from their worse, but better part. And that before conversion is
        particularly mentioned here, to illustrate the love of God to them,
        notwithstanding this their character and condition; and to show that the
        love of God to them was very early; it anteceded their conversion; it
        was before the death of Christ for them; yea, it was from everlasting:
        and also to express the freeness of it, and to make it appear, that it
        did not arise from any loveliness in them; or from any love in them to
        him; nor from any works of righteousness done by them, but from his own
        sovereign will and pleasure.

      Much more then being now justified by his blood,.... The apostle here
      argues from justification by Christ to salvation by him, there being a
      certain and inseparable connection between these two; whoever is justified
      shall be saved; and speaks of justification "as being now by his blood".
      Justification in God's mind from eternity proceeded upon the suretyship
      engagements of Christ to be performed in time; the Old Testament saints
      were justified of God with a view to the blood of the Lamb which was to be
      shed; this blood was "now" shed, and an application of justification by it
      was "now" made to the persons spoken of; which is the reason of this way
      of speaking. The blood of Christ intends his death, as appears from the
      context, and shows it to be a violent death; death by the effusion of
      blood. There is an emphasis upon it, "his blood"; not the blood of bulls
      and goats, nor of a mere innocent creature, but of Christ the Son of God;
      which is therefore efficacious to all the purposes for which it was shed,
      and particularly justification. This being ascribed to it, shows the
      concern Christ had in it, his blood is here put for the whole matter of
      justification; the shedding of that being the finishing part of it; and
      that our justification before God proceeds upon the foot of a satisfaction
      made to the law and justice of God: hence such as are interested in it,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall be saved from wrath through him: not from wrath, as a corruption
        in their own hearts, which oftentimes breaks forth; nor as appearing
        among the people of God one towards another, which is sometimes very
        bitter; or as in their avowed enemies, the effects of which they often
        feel; nor from the wrath of devils, which is as the roaring of a lion;
        but from the wrath of God, from a sense and apprehension of it in their
        own consciences, which the law works; from which justification by the
        blood of Christ frees them; though under first awakenings they feel it,
        and sometimes, under afflictive dispensations of Providence, are ready
        to fear it: and also from the infliction of vindictive wrath or
        punishment for sin; for though they are as deserving of it as others,
        yet as they are not appointed to it, so they are entirely delivered from
        it, through Christ's sustaining it in their room and stead: wherefore
        they are secure from it both in this life, and in the world to come.

      For if when we were enemies,.... For the further illustration of the love
      of God expressed to sinners, by the death of his Son, the state and
      condition God's elect were in when Christ died for them is taken notice
      of; they "were enemies"; to God, to his being, perfections, purposes, and
      providences; to Christ, to his person, offices, grace, and righteousness;
      to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit, and his divine operations and
      influences; to the people of God, and to the Gospel and ordinances of
      Christ; which enmity is deeply rooted in their minds, is causeless, and
      undeserved, and is implacable, and irreconcileable without the power and
      grace of God; which grace of God is wonderfully displayed in the
      reconciliation of such persons,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by the death of his Son. Reconciliation implies a former state of
        friendship, a breach of that friendship, and a making of it up again;
        which no ways contradicts the everlasting and unchangeable love of God
        to his people; for this is not a reconciliation of God to them, but of
        them to God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        we were reconciled to God; not God to us; and this reconciliation is for
        their sins, an atonement for them, rather than of their persons; which
        being done, their persons are reconciled, not to the love, grace, and
        mercy of God, or to his affections, in which they always had a share,
        but to the justice of God injured and offended by their sins; and so
        both justice and holiness on one side, and love, grace, and mercy on the
        other, are reconciled together, in the business of their salvation;
        which is brought about by the sufferings and death of Christ: this
        expresses the wonderful love of God, since this reconciliation arises
        purely from himself; the scheme of it is of his own contriving; he,
        whose justice was affronted, and whose law was broken, took the first
        step towards it, and conducted the whole affair; and which was effected
        at the expense of the blood and life of his own Son, and that for
        persons who were enemies to them both. In consequence of this, another
        reconciliation of them is made by the Spirit of God in regenerations, of
        which notice is taken in this passage:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        much more being reconciled: to God, as a sovereign God, in his decrees,
        in his providences, and in the method of salvation by his Son; to
        Christ, to the way of salvation by him, so as to submit both to his
        righteousness for justification, and to the sceptre of his kingdom, to
        be ruled and governed by it; to the Spirit, so as to be led by him, to
        walk after him, and to depend upon him for the carrying on, and
        finishing the good work of grace begun in them; to the people of God, so
        as to love them, and delight in their company; and to the Gospel and
        ordinances, so as highly to value them, long after them, and take
        pleasure in them. Now from both these reconciliations is inferred the
        sure and certain salvation of persons so reconciled:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        we shall be saved by his life; by the life of Christ, and which designs
        not so much his life as God; or his living in the hearts of his people
        by faith; though neither of them are to be excluded; but his life, as
        man, and that not either his private or public life, as man here on
        earth, though this has an influence upon, and a concern in the business
        of salvation; but more especially here is meant the interceding life of
        Christ in heaven, where he lives, and ever lives to make intercession
        for his people, and to see the salvation he has obtained by his death
        applied unto them, and they put into the possession of it.

      </p>
      And not only so, but we also joy in God,.... Something seems here to be
      understood, and which is to be supplied thus; not only we are saved by his
      life, and from wrath through him; not only are we reconciled to God by his
      Son, and Spirit; not only Christ has died for us while sinners and
      ungodly; not only do we glory in tribulations, and rejoice in hope of the
      glory of God: "but we also joy in God"; himself, as our covenant God and
      Father in Christ, as the God of all grace, peace, and salvation; in his
      perfections, as engaged on our side, and as glorified in our salvation; in
      the purposes of God, and his covenant transactions with his Son, as they
      are made known in the everlasting Gospel; in all his providential
      dispensations, which are mercy and truth; and in our being of him in
      Christ, and Christ's being made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
      sanctification, and redemption; in all the blessings of grace we receive
      from him, the glory of which is his due; and in his sight and presence,
      and in the enjoyment of him. The means by which saints come at this joying
      and glorying in God, is
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through our Lord Jesus Christ; not the light of nature, nor the law of
        Moses, nor any works of righteousness done by men, nor through angels or
        saints, but Christ, and him only; for it is only in and through him that
        God is their covenant God and Father; by him only have they the
        agreeable view of his glorious perfections; in him only all his purposes
        and promises have their fulfilment; it is by his hands, and through his
        blood, that all the blessings of grace are conveyed to them; their
        access to God is only by him; and by him they give the praise and glory
        of every mercy to him. And the ground of this joy is the expiation of
        sin by Christ,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by whom we have now received the atonement; atonement is not made, but
        received by us; which denotes the application of the atoning blood and
        sacrifice of Christ to the conscience, the Spirit's witness of interest
        in it, and the office of faith, as a recipient of it: it is not faith,
        nor anything else of the creature's, that makes the atonement, only
        Christ; but faith receives it from him, and by him; which, as it is the
        ground of present joying in God, so it is the foundation of hope of
        future glory: the word "now" refers to the Gospel dispensation. The poor
        Jews are at the utmost loss about atonement: sometimes they tell (c) us
        it is by confession, repentance, and good works; sometimes by
        beneficence and hospitality (d); sometimes they say their captivity is
        their atonement (e); and, at other times, that death expiates all their
        sins (f). Blessed be God for the atoning sacrifice of Christ!
