      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The apostle in this chapter pursues his exhortation to mutual affection
        and forbearance, notwithstanding their different sentiments about the
        use of meats, and observation of days; excuses his writing so freely to
        them, which they might bear with, in consideration of his being an
        apostle, especially an apostle of the Gentiles, and which office he
        magnified and fulfilled everywhere; gives them the reasons why he had
        not as yet been with them though he greatly desired it, encourages them
        to expect, a visit from him; and concludes with earnestly entreating
        them that he might have a share in their prayers: and first, as an
        inference from what he had said in the preceding chapter, he lays it
        down as a duty incumbent on himself, and all that were strong in the
        doctrine of Christian liberty, to bear with the infirmities of weak
        Christians, and not please themselves, but others (Rom 15:1) which he
        enforces, from the usefulness of it, it being for the good and
        edification of others (Rom 15:2) and from the
        example of Christ, who pleased not himself (Rom 15:3) and which is
        proved from a passage of Scripture in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009">Psa 69:9</a>, the pertinency
        of which passage, and the citation and application of it to Christ and
        the present case, are vindicated from this consideration, that whatever
        was written in former times, was for the use of the saints under the
        Gospel dispensation (Rom 15:4) and that the
        exhortation might have its effect upon them, be puts up a prayer to God
        for them, that such a temper of mind might be in them, which would be
        for the glory of God (Rom 15:5) and then he
        repeats his exhortation (Rom 15:7) that they would
        affectionately receive one another; which he urges by the example of
        Christ, who had received them to the glory of God; and that they might
        glorify him, and this was one way of doing it: and that this argument
        might have the greater weight with both parties, he observes, that Jesus
        Christ had a special regard to the Jews, and was their minister, sent
        unto them to fulfil the promises made unto their fathers, and had
        received them; and therefore though they were weak, they were not to be
        despised, grieved, and offended (Rom 15:8) and as for the
        Gentiles, it was a clear case that God had had long ago a design of
        mercy to them, and that they were to be, and were now received by
        Christ, and so under obligation to glorify God for his mercy; and
        therefore not to be judged and condemned, though they did not conform to
        the ceremonial law; and this he proves in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009">Rom 15:9</a>, from several
        passages of Scripture in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049">Psa 18:49</a>, and closes this
        argument he had so long insisted on with a prayer to God for them, that
        they might be in the exercise of faith and hope; and, in the exercise of
        those graces, be filled with joy and peace (Rom 15:13) and in order to
        prevent an objection that might be made to these prayers and
        exhortations of his, that they suggested that they were wicked and
        ignorant men, devoid of affection, and knew not how to behave to each
        other, nor to exhort one another, the apostle softens such a resentment,
        by calling them brethren, and by expressing his persuasion of their
        abundant goodness, knowledge, and abilities (Rom 15:14) and excuses the
        freedom he took with them by observing, that he only acted the part of a
        monitor (Rom 15:15) and
        the rather this freedom might be allowed him, on account of the great
        gifts bestowed upon him, qualifying him to be an apostle of Christ; and
        especially as he was an apostle of the Gentiles and so their apostle (Rom 15:16) and on account
        of his office, gifts, and usefulness, he had reason to glory; though
        through Christ only, and in things relating to God, and not himself (Rom 15:17) when he takes
        an occasion to enlarge on his ministry, and magnify his office; partly
        from the end and success of it, bringing the Gentiles to the obedience
        of Christ (Rom 15:18) and
        partly from the means and causes of such success the preaching of the
        word, working miracles, and the power of the Holy Ghost; and from the
        extent of it, reaching from Jerusalem to Illyricum (Rom 15:19) and from the
        difficulty which attended it, he preaching in places where the Gospel
        was never preached before, and which he chose to do (Rom 15:20) and which was
        necessary to be done, according to a prophecy in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#015">Isa 52:15</a>, which he cites (Rom 15:21) and observes,
        that it was his preaching in these many and distant parts that was the
        reason of his not having been with the saints at Rome (Rom 15:22) but now gives
        them reason to expect his coming; partly because he had finished his
        travels in those countries, and partly because of the vehement desire he
        had to see them (Rom 15:23) and besides, an
        opportunity seemed to be offering, he intending to take a journey to
        Spain, when it would lie in his way to come to Rome, and be for his
        advantage (Rom 15:24) in
        the mean while he informs them what he was engaged in, to carry the
        contribution of the Macedonian and Asian churches to Jerusalem, for the
        poor saints there (Rom 15:25) on which
        contributions he enlarges, showing not only who made them, and for whom,
        but the source and spring of them, they arose from their good will and
        pleasure (Rom 15:26) and
        yet they were debtors, and under obligation to do what they did; it was
        but a piece of justice and equity, since those churches had received of
        the spiritual things of the Jews (Rom 15:27) and as for his
        coming to them, he acquaints them of the time that it would be, when he
        had finished the above service and labour of love, and when he should
        come into Spain, as he had before signified (Rom 15:28) and of the
        manner in which he should come, of which he was fully persuaded, as that
        it would be with the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ (Rom 15:29) and then with
        great importunity desires them to pray for him, and that very earnestly (Rom 15:30) particularly
        that he might be delivered from his enemies in Judea, and that the
        saints there would accept of what he brought them from the Gentiles (Rom 15:31) and that, if it
        was the will of God, he might come to them and be refreshed with them (Rom 15:32) and then closes
        the chapter with a salutation of them, or a wish that the God of peace
        might be with them,

      For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia,.... That is, the
      churches of Macedonia, particularly Philippi and Thessalonica; and the
      churches of Achaia, especially the church at Corinth, which was the
      metropolis of Achaia:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at
        Jerusalem; of which contribution, of their great forwardness, readiness,
        and liberality, a large account is given in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001">Co2 8:1</a>; from whence
        Origen and others have rightly concluded, that this epistle to the
        Romans was wrote after that; since in that the apostle exhorts and
        encourages them, by the example of the Macedonian churches, to finish
        the collection they had begun; which collection is here called a
        contribution, or "communion", as the word signifies; it being one part
        of the communion of churches and of saints, to relieve their poor, by
        communicating to them, and to assist each other therein; and in which
        they have not only fellowship with one another, but with Christ the
        head; who takes what is done to the least of his brethren as done to
        himself: the persons for whom the collection was made, are "the poor
        saints", or "the poor of the saints"; for not all the saints, but the
        poor among them, were the objects of this generosity: they were saints
        such as are sanctified by God the Father in eternal election, and by the
        blood of Christ in redemption, and by the Spirit of Christ in the
        effectual calling, to these this goodness extended; for though good is
        to be done to all men, yet more especially to the household of faith:
        they were "poor", which is the lot of many who are saints, whom God has
        chosen, to whom the Gospel is preached, and who are called by grace:
        these came to be so, either through the great dearth which was
        throughout the world in the times of Claudius Caesar, when the brethren
        at Jerusalem particularly suffered, and were relieved by the disciples
        at Antioch; but this collection was made some years after that, and
        therefore rather they became so, through the persecutions of their
        countrymen; by whom they suffered joyfully the spoiling of their goods,
        knowing that they had a better and more enduring substance in heaven; or
        else through their having sold all their possessions, and thrown their
        money into one common stock and fund, for mutual subsistence, which was
        now exhausted: these poor saints lived at Jerusalem, which was at a
        great distance from Macedonia and Achaia; but though they were
        strangers, and unknown by face to them, and had only heard of them, and
        their distress; yet this was no objection to their cheerful
        contribution; they considered them as members of the same body, as
        belonging to the same family, and as standing in the same spiritual
        relation to God and Christ with themselves; and upon this foot they
        acted; and what they did is worthy the imitation of all the churches and
        people of God.

      It hath pleased them verily,.... This is repeated from the former verse,
      and is designed to point out the spring of this contribution, and the
      manner in which it was performed: it arose from themselves; it was the
      pure effect of their good will and pleasure; the first motion was from
      among themselves; it was their own thought, mind, and will; they were
      willing of themselves unto it, and begun it of themselves, unasked, and
      not moved unto it by any other: it was not done by constraint or
      necessity, but was entirely free; they did not make it for ostentation
      sake, or to gain the applause of men, but from a principle of love to the
      poor saints; and which showed itself to be sincere, hearty, and genuine,
      by deeds, and not bare words: they performed this service with great
      alacrity and cheerfulness; they gave not sparingly, but largely; it was
      not a matter of covetousness, but of bounty; and they did it not
      grudgingly, but cheerfully; they took delight and pleasure in it; their
      hearts and souls were in it, and yet notwithstanding did but what they
      ought to do.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And their debtors they are; for being debtors to God for their temporal
        and spiritual mercies; and to Christ for what he has done for them in
        redemption, and for what he is to them; and to the Spirit for the
        influences and operations of his grace upon them, they are debtors to
        the saints; they are bound to love them; they owe the debt of love to
        them, as they are in the spiritual relation of the children of God,
        members of Christ, and brethren one of another; and their paying of this
        debt to them is, in some sense, reckoned a paying it to the divine
        persons. Moreover, it was not merely a debt of love which these Gentiles
        owed, and in this way paid to the believing Jews; but it was a debt of
        justice and equity; they had received what was of valuable consideration
        from them, and by their means: Christ himself was of the Jews; hence
        salvation is said to be of them,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022">Joh 4:22</a>. The writings of
        the Old Testament were committed to them, and faithfully preserved by
        them; and from them transmitted to the Gentiles; the apostles were all
        Jews, under whose ministry they were enlightened, converted, and brought
        to the knowledge of Christ, and salvation by him; the Gospel of the
        grace of God came out from among them; it was first preached in Judea,
        and at Jerusalem; and from thence was carried and spread in the Gentile
        world; yea, it looks very likely, and is not at all unreasonable to
        suppose, that the charge of carrying and spreading the Gospel among the
        Gentiles was at first defrayed by the believing Jews, and out of that
        common stock and fund which was at Jerusalem; for it was not proper that
        the apostles, at their first setting out, should take anything of the
        Gentiles, lest they should be thought to be mercenary persons, who only
        sought their own worldly advantage: hence the apostle argues from the
        greater to the lesser,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things: the
        Gospel, and the doctrines of it, which are spiritual things; contain and
        make known spiritual blessings; impart spiritual gifts; in which the
        Spirit of God is greatly concerned, he is the author of them; he leads
        men into them; qualifies them to preach them unto others; blesses and
        succeeds them to the conversion; comfort, and edification of souls; and
        by means of which he himself is received as a Spirit of illumination,
        sanctification, and faith: and which doctrines also relate to the
        spiritual and eternal welfare of the souls and spirits of men; hereby
        they are enlightened, quickened, comforted, and nourished up unto
        eternal life: wherefore, since this is the case, and these the favours
        the Gentiles enjoyed through the Jews,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things; in outward
        and temporal things; in things pertaining to the flesh; or outward man,
        for the clothing and nourishment of the body. This he said to stir up
        the Romans, who were Gentiles also, and under the same obligations to
        make a contribution for them likewise.

      When therefore I have performed this,.... Meaning when he had dispatched
      that business, and finished that affair which the Macedonian and Achaian
      churches had entreated him to engage in, and which he had undertook;
      namely, to take their collection, and carry it to Jerusalem, and
      distribute it among the poor saints there; and which he expresses by
      another phrase,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and have sealed to them this fruit. The liberality of the Gentile
        churches is called fruit, as it may be on many accounts; as with respect
        to the apostle, it was the fruit of his ministry and laborious preaching
        of the Gospel among them; he had been sowing the seed of the word, and
        planting churches in these parts; and among other fruits brought forth
        hereby, as the conversion of sinners, and edification of saints, the
        exercise of grace, and performance of good works, this of liberality to
        the poor saints was one: with respect to the persons, the objects of
        this bounty, it was the fruit of their spiritual things, which the
        Gentiles, by their means, had been partakers of; and would be as fruit,
        useful and profitable to them, to relieve their wants, supply them with
        necessaries, and make their lives more comfortable: and also with
        respect to the contributors, it was the fruit of the Spirit of God, and
        his grace in them; it was the fruit of faith, which works by love; and
        it was the fruit of their love to Christ, and to his saints; and was
        profitable to them in things temporal, spiritual, and eternal; promises
        of each being made and performed to such that sow liberally and
        bountifully. Now the ministration of this to the poor saints at
        Jerusalem, and on the behalf of the Grecian churches, the apostle calls
        a "sealing" it to them; and it is thought to be an allusion to the
        delivery of money sealed up, that it may not be lost, nor made use of
        for any other purpose than that for which it was designed: whether the
        apostle carried this collection sealed or not, it matters not; his sense
        is, that he should deliver it whole and safe unto them, and in such
        manner as to leave no suspicion that he had converted any part of it to
        his own use; though the word here used seems to answer to the Hebrew
        which, with the Jews, frequently signifies to conclude, "finish", and
        make an end of anything, as well as to "seal"; the sealing up of letters
        being the last and finishing part of them. Innumerable instances might
        be given; take the following one as a proof (d):
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "we find in the former prophets, , "that they sealed", or ended their
        words with words of praise, or with words of consolation Says R.
        Eliezer, except Jeremiah, "who sealed", or finished with words of
        reproof.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        So the word is used in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24</a>, and then the
        apostle's plain meaning is, when I have made an end of this affair, have
        finished this business of ministering and distributing to the poor
        saints at Jerusalem,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I will come by you into Spain. The Ethiopic version reads it,
        "Lasitania", designing, no doubt, Lusitania, which was formerly a part
        of Spain, now called Portugal. Whether the apostle ever was there is not
        certain nor very probable, since when he came to Jerusalem he was
        apprehended, and after sometime sent a prisoner to Rome, where he
        suffered; however, it was his intention to go to Spain, and to take Rome
        in his way thither.

      And I am sure when I come to you,.... He intended to go to Spain; he was
      not sure he should reach thither; but he was positive in it he should come
      to Rome. It had been much and long upon his mind; and under an impress of
      the Spirit of God upon him, he had signified some time before this, that
      after he had been at Jerusalem, he "must see, Rome also" (Act 19:21) and it was
      afterwards more expressly told him by the Lord, that as he had testified
      of him at Jerusalem, he should bear witness at Rome also (Act 23:11) and therefore he
      was fully assured he should come to Rome, and was as confident of the
      manner of his coming thither.
      <p></p>
      <p>I shall come in, or "with"</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ; with the Gospel,
        the good news of salvation by Christ; and which must make him a welcome
        person to every sensible soul wherever he came; to this he was chosen,
        separated, and called; for this he was abundantly qualified; this was
        committed to his trust, and which he carried with him wherever he went:
        and he was not ashamed of it, and was ready to preach it even at Rome
        also. With "the Gospel of Christ"; not his own, or another's, or any
        man's, but Christ's, which he had by the revelation of Christ; of which
        Christ is the sum and substance, and which Christ himself preached;
        "with the blessing of the Gospel of Christ". Some by "blessing"
        understand a liberal contribution, which he trusted he should make at
        Rome, for the poor saints at Jerusalem; believing that their hearts
        would be opened, under the preaching of the Gospel, to give freely to
        them, and that this would be a blessing that would attend it: but rather
        he means, either the blessed gifts he had, qualifying him for preaching
        the Gospel, with which he should come and deliver it among them, and
        which would attend it with success; such as boldness of spirit, freedom
        of speech, enlarged knowledge, mighty signs and wonders, and the
        demonstration of the Spirit, and of power: or the blessed effects it
        would have on them, in establishing them in the present truths; in
        further enlightening and instructing their minds; in edifying,
        quickening, and comforting them; and in nourishing up with the words of
        faith and sound doctrine, unto eternal life: or the blessings of grace
        exhibited and set forth in the Gospel; such as justification and
        forgiveness of sins, peace and reconciliation, salvation and eternal
        life. Nay, he believed he should come in, or with the "fulness" of all
        this; meaning, either that he believed he should find them full of the
        Gospel, and the fruits of it; or rather that he should come full fraught
        with it, and fully preach it to them, and keep back thing that would be
        profitable. There is a fulness in the Gospel; it is full of the deep
        things of God, which the Spirit searches and reveals,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#010">Co1 2:10</a>; it is full of
        the doctrines of grace and truth, which Christ himself is said to be
        full of (Joh 1:14) it is
        full of exceeding great and precious promises transcribed from Christ,
        and out of the covenant of grace; and it is full of a variety of food,
        of milk for babes (Heb 5:13) and meat for
        strong persons, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014">Heb 5:14</a>.
        The Alexandrian copy, and some others, read only, "with the fulness of
        the blessing of Christ"; and so the Ethiopic version.

      Now I beseech you, brethren,.... Having declared his intention of coming
      to them, and his confidence of it, he entreats an interest in their
      prayers; and which he urges from the consideration of their mutual
      relation as "brethren"; and therefore should love one another, and show
      it, among other things, by praying for each other to their common parent,
      in whom they have a joint interest, saying, as directed by Christ, "our
      Father which art in heaven",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045">Mat 5:45</a>; thereby
      signifying, that they prayed not for themselves only, but for all the
      brethren, all the children of God: and this the apostle further urges,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for Christ's sake; whose servant he was, and in whose cause he was
        engaged, whose Gospel he preached, and whose glory he sought; and
        therefore, if they had any regard for Christ, and the good of his
        interest, he beseeches them that they would pray for the continuance of
        his life and usefulness; since for him to live was for the good of the
        churches of Christ, though for him to die would be his own personal
        gain: and which he also stirs them up to,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for the love of the Spirit; meaning either the love of the Father, and
        of the Son, which was shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, which
        he had directed them into, and they had a comfortable sensation of; or
        that love to God, to Christ, and one another, which the Spirit of God
        had wrought in them in regeneration; or that love with which the Spirit
        of God equally loved them, as the Father, and the Son; and which he had
        shown in their conversion and sanctification, in applying all grace unto
        them, and indwelling in them as the Spirit of adoption, and as the
        earnest and pledge of the heavenly inheritance.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        That ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me. The
        apostle prayed for himself, as he had been wont to do ever since he was
        a converted man; but knowing well the force of united social prayer, he
        desires the assistance of others. He represents prayer as an agony, an
        holy conflict, and striving with God, a wrestling with him, as Jacob
        did, who held him, and would not let him go without the blessing, and
        had power with him, and prevailed. The phrase denotes the fervency of
        prayer, the strength, labour, and energy of it; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#012">Col 4:12</a>; and also
        intimates, that the apostle foresaw he should have a combat with many
        enemies where he was going, and should be in great danger by them; and
        therefore desires they would join him in the use of their spiritual
        armour, and in that particular part of it, prayer, which has been often
        used to good purpose against the enemies of the Gospel: he does not
        desire these Romans to beg the assistance of their senate or emperor:
        but to pray to God for him, and join with him in their prayers to him,
        who is a God hearing prayer, and able to save. The petitions he would
        have them put up to him, are as follow:

      That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea,.... By
      whom some think are meant such, who, though they believed in Jesus as the
      Messiah, yet were violently set against the apostle for preaching down the
      ceremonial law; and from whom he foresaw he should be in much danger when
      he came to Jerusalem, and therefore desires the church at Rome to pray for
      his deliverance from them; though rather such who did not believe in Jesus
      Christ at all are designed; and who were enemies to the Gospel, and to all
      Gospel ministers, but especially to the Apostle Paul, for preaching among
      the Gentiles, and such doctrines as he did, which struck at their peculiar
      notions; and, as he feared, he should be set upon by them, and his life be
      in great danger, so it was; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#027">Act 21:27</a>; though he was not
      disheartened and intimidated, and did not shun going up to Jerusalem,
      though entreated not to go; yet he thought proper to engage the churches
      of Christ in prayer for him, that he might be delivered out of the hands
      of such wicked and unreasonable men, who being destitute of faith in
      Christ, were filled with enmity against his ministers; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#001">Th2 3:1</a>;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and that my service which I have for Jerusalem, may be accepted of the
        saints; that is, that the collection which was made by the Gentile
        churches for the poor saints at Jerusalem, the ministration of which
        unto them he had took upon him, might be cheerfully and gratefully
        received by them. One would think there were no fear of this, nor any
        need to pray for it; for if they were poor, and in necessitous
        circumstances, as they were, they would be glad of relief, and
        thankfully accept it: but the case was this, and the difficulties
        attending this service were, that this collection came from the
        Gentiles, to whom the Jews had an aversion, and was brought to them by
        one that they had entertained an ill opinion of, being informed that he
        had taught the Gentiles to forsake Moses, not to circumcise their
        children, or walk after the customs; wherefore he did not know whether,
        though in necessity, anything coming for their relief from such a
        quarter, and through his hands, would be received with any pleasure by
        them: besides, his desire was that it might be received as a token of
        the true and sincere love the Gentiles bore to them; and be a means of
        reconciling the believing Jews to them, to own them as sister churches
        of the same faith and order with themselves.

      That I may come unto you with joy,.... The end the apostle had, in
      desiring them to request the above things at the throne of grace for him,
      was, that he might come to them, which unless he was delivered from the
      unbelieving Jews, could not be; and therefore since they had an interest
      in this matter, he might hope they would be the more importunate in their
      supplications for him, the he might escape their hands; and seeing also,
      should the saints there use him in an ungrateful manner, and slight the
      kindness of the Gentile churches, and his service should not have the
      desired effect, his coming to them would be with sorrow: wherefore he puts
      them upon praying for success in this affair, that so when he came among
      them he should have no uneasiness upon his mind, or, anything of this kind
      to distress him, and interrupt that pleasure and delight he promised
      himself in their company and conversation: he adds,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by the will of God: resigning himself, and submitting all things to the
        sovereign will of God, and the wise disposals of his providence: he knew
        his deliverance from his enemies must be by, and the success of his
        services owing to, and his coming to Rome entirely according to, the
        will of God, and as he should think fit and proper; so he acted himself,
        and so he taught these believers to have their regard to, and sit down
        contented with the will of God in all things; to which he subjoins,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and may with you be refreshed; with the presence of God among them, with
        the Gospel in the fulness and blessing of it with which he should come
        and with the mutual faith and comfortable experience of him and them,
        which they should communicate to each other; than all which nothing is
        more reviving, and refreshing to the spirits of God's people.

      Now the God of peace be with you all, Amen. As God is in this chapter
      before styled the God of patience (Rom 15:5) and the God of
      hope (Rom 15:13) because of
      his concern in these graces; so he is here styled "the God of peace",
      because of his concern in that peace which is made between him and his
      people, by the blood of Christ. This peace was first upon his thoughts,
      which are therefore called thoughts of peace; a council of peace was held
      between him and his Son upon this head; the scheme of reconciliation was
      drawn by him in it; he entered into a covenant of peace with Christ, which
      takes its name from this momentous article of it; he appointed Christ to
      be the peacemaker, and laid on him the chastisement of our peace; and it
      pleased him by him to reconcile all things to himself,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20</a>. Moreover, he is so
      called because he is the giver of all true solid conscience peace, the
      peace of God, which passeth all understanding of natural men; and which
      when he gives, none can give trouble; and is what he fills his people with
      in a way of believing, leading their faith to the blood, righteousness,
      and sacrifice of his Son. He is also the author of happiness and
      prosperity, temporal, spiritual, and eternal, and likewise of all the
      peace and concord which is in his churches, and among his saints; so that
      when the apostle wishes that the God of peace might be with them, he not
      only prays that the presence of God might be with them; but that they
      might have fresh views of their interest in peace, made by the blood of
      Christ; that they might enjoy peace in their own consciences, arising from
      thence; that they might be possessed of felicity of every kind, and that
      unity and harmony might subsist among them; that the peace of God might
      rule in their hearts, and they live in love and peace one with another,
      laying aside all their differences as Jews and Gentiles, about the rites
      and ceremonies of the law of Moses; to which the apostle may have a
      particular respect in this concluding wish of his, and here indeed
      properly the epistle ends; the following chapter being as a sort of
      postscript, filled up with salutations and recommendations of particular
      persons; wherefore the word "Amen" is placed here, though it is wanting in
      the Alexandrian copy.

      We then that are strong,.... Meaning not only ministers of the Gospel, who
      are men of strong parts, great abilities, mighty in the Scriptures,
      valiant for the truth on earth, and pillars in God's house; for though the
      apostle includes himself, yet not merely as such, but as expressing it to
      be his duty in common with other Christians; and the rather he does this,
      to engage them to the practice of it: but the stronger and more knowing
      part of private Christians are here intended; the Apostle John's young
      men, who are strong, in distinction from little children, or new born
      babes, that are at present weaklings; and from fathers who are on the
      decline of life, and just going off the stage; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#012">Jo1 2:12</a>; when these young
      men are in the bloom and flower of a profession, in the prime of their
      judgment, and exercise of grace; who are strong in Christ, and not in
      themselves, in the grace that is in him, out of which they continually
      receive; who are strong in the grace of faith, and are established and
      settled in the doctrine of it; and have a large and extensive knowledge of
      the several truths of the Gospel; and, among the rest, of that of
      Christian liberty:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        ought to bear the infirmities of the weak; of them that are weak in
        faith and knowledge, particularly in the knowledge of their freedom from
        Mosaical observances: their "infirmities" are partly their ignorance,
        mistakes, and errors, about things indifferent; which they consider and
        insist on, and would impose upon others, as necessary and obliging; and
        partly the peevishness and moroseness which they show, the hard words
        they give, and the rash judgment and rigid censures they pass on their
        brethren, that differ from them: such persons and their infirmities are
        to be borne with; they are not to be despised for their weakness; and if
        in the church, are not to be excluded for their mistakes; and if not
        members, are not to be refused on account of them; since they arise from
        weakness, and are not subversive of the fundamental doctrines of the
        Gospel: they are not to be treated as wicked men, but as weak brethren;
        and their peevish tempers, morose dispositions and conduct, their hard
        speeches and censorious expressions, are patiently to be endured; they
        should be considered as from whence they arise, not from malice and ill
        will, from a malignant spirit, but from weakness and misguided zeal, for
        what they take to be in force, when it is abolished: moreover, they are
        to be complied with in cases not sinful, as the apostle did in
        circumcising Timothy (Act 16:3) and purifying
        himself according to the law,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026">Act 21:26</a>; and so to the
        weak he became weak, to gain some (Co1 9:22) and therefore
        could urge this exhortation by his own example with greater force; and
        which he represents, not only as what would be honourable, and a point
        of good nature, and as doing a kind action, but as what "ought" to be;
        what the law of love obliges to, and what the grace of love, which
        "bears all things" (Co1 13:7) constrains unto;
        and which indeed if not done, they that are strong do not answer one end
        of their having that spiritual strength they have; and it is but
        complying with the golden rule of Christ, to do as we would be done by (Mat 7:12)
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and not please ourselves: either entertain pleasing thoughts of, and
        make pleasing reflections on their stronger faith, greater degree of
        knowledge, superior light and understanding; which being indulged, are
        apt to excite and encourage spiritual pride and vanity, and generally
        issue in the contempt of weaker brethren; nor do those things, which are
        pleasing and grateful to themselves, to the offence and detriment of
        others; for instance, and which is what the apostle has reference to, to
        gratify their appetite, by eating such meat as is forbidden by the law
        of Moses, to the grieving of the weak brethren, wounding their
        consciences, and destroying their peace; these things should not be
        done; stronger Christians should deny themselves the use of their
        Christian liberty in things indifferent, when they cannot make use of it
        without offence.

      Let everyone of us please his neighbour,.... Every man, particularly his
      Christian friend and brother, whom he should seek to please in all things,
      and by all means lawful; he should carry it affably and courteously,
      should make himself agreeable to him; should condescend and accommodate
      himself to his weakness, and bear his infirmities, and deny himself rather
      than displease him. The Vulgate Latin version and some copies read, "let
      everyone of you"; but the other reading is preferable, and best agrees
      with the context,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001">Rom 15:1</a>.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For his good; or as the Syriac renders it, "in good things"; for he is
        not to be pleased, gratified, and indulged, in any thing that is evil:
        we are not to please any man in anything that is contrary to the Gospel
        of Christ, for then we should not be faithful servants of his; nor in
        anything repugnant to the commands of God, and ordinances of Christ, who
        are to be obeyed and pleased, rather than men; nor in anything that is
        of an immoral nature, we are not to comply with, though it may be to the
        displeasure of the dearest relation and friend; but in everything that
        is naturally, civilly, morally, or evangelically good, we should study
        to please them; and in whatsoever may be for their good, temporal,
        spiritual, or eternal: and
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to edification: of our neighbour, brother, and Christian friend, for the
        establishment of his peace, the increase of his spiritual light, and the
        building of him up in his most holy faith; and also of the whole
        community, or church, to which each belong, whose peace and edification
        should be consulted, and everything done, which may promote and secure
        it; and among which this is one, every man to please his neighbour, in
        things lawful and laudable.

      For even Christ pleased not himself,.... He sought not his own ease,
      pleasure, profit, honour, and glory, but to do his Father's will and work,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#034">Joh 4:34</a>; and he always did
      the things which pleased him, in his obedience, sufferings, and death; and
      sought not his own, but his glory: moreover, what he did and suffered were
      not for himself, but for us; he became incarnate for us; he obeyed,
      suffered, and died for us; he came not to be ministered to, to be attended
      upon as an earthly prince, enjoying his own ease and pleasure, things
      grateful to nature, but to minister to others,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028">Mat 20:28</a>; hence he appeared
      in the form of a servant, did the work of one in life, and at last became
      obedient to death, even the death of the cross (Phi 2:7) not but that he was
      well pleased in doing and suffering all this; it was his delight to do the
      will of God: it was his meat and drink to finish his work; yea, that part
      of it which was most disagreeable to flesh and blood, was most earnestly
      desired by him, even the baptism of his sufferings; and in the view of the
      salvation of his people, and of enjoying their company with him to all
      eternity, he endured the cross patiently, and despised the shame with
      pleasure (Heb 12:2) but then
      he met with many things which were far from being grateful to human
      nature; such as the hardness and unbelief of the Jews, with which he was
      grieved, their scoffs and insults, reproaches and jeers; the ignorance,
      frowardness, and moroseness of his own disciples, whose infirmities he
      bore; and at last the sufferings of death, that bitter cup, which he as
      man desired might pass from him; but, however, he submitted to his
      Father's will, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#039">Mat 26:39</a>;
      all which prove what the apostle here affirms. This instance of Christ,
      the man of God's right hand, the son of man, whom he has made strong for
      himself, the head of the church, the leader and commander of the people,
      bearing the infirmities of the weak, and not pleasing himself, is very
      pertinently produced, to enforce the above exhortations; who is an example
      to his people in the exercise of every grace, and the discharge of every
      duty; as in beneficence, forgiving of injuries, mutual love, meekness and
      humility, suffering of afflictions, and patience. The proof of it follows,
      <p></p>

        but as it is written, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009">Psa 69:9</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me; which are the
        words of Christ unto his Father, as the whole psalm is to be understood
        not of David, but of the Messiah, as is clear from the citations out of
        it, and references to it in the New Testament; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017">Joh 2:17</a>, compared with
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009">Psa 69:9</a>, and the meaning
        of them is, either that the reproaches which were cast on the house,
        worship, and ordinances of God, affected Christ as much as if they had
        been cast upon himself; which stirred up his zeal to take the method he
        did, to show his resentment at such indignities; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#015">Joh 2:15</a>, or that the same
        persons by whom the name of God was blasphemed, his sanctuary polluted,
        and his ordinances reproached, also reproached him; and he bore in his
        bosom the reproach of all the mighty people, which were in great plenty
        poured upon him; they reproached him with being a glutton, a winebibber,
        a friend of publicans and sinners,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#019">Mat 11:19</a>; they said he
        was a Samaritan, and had a devil (Joh 8:48) charged him with
        blasphemy and sedition,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#065">Mat 26:65</a>; and when on the
        cross, mocked, reviled, and wagged their heads at him,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039">Mat 27:39</a>; all which he
        bore patiently, and reviled not again: moreover, by "reproaches" may be
        meant the sins of his people, by which the name of God was blasphemed,
        his law trampled upon with contempt, and the perfections of his nature,
        as his justice and holiness, dishonoured; and which fell upon Christ,
        not by chance, but by the appointment of God, and according to his own
        voluntary agreement; and which he bore in his own body, and made
        satisfaction for; which though he did willingly, in order to obtain some
        valuable ends, the salvation of his people, and the glorifying of the
        divine perfections, the honouring of the law, and satisfying of justice,
        yet the bearing of them, in itself, could not be grateful to him as
        such; neither the charge of sin, nor the weight of punishment; and in
        this respect he pleased not himself, or did that which was grateful to
        his pure and holy nature.

      For whatsoever things were written aforetime,.... In the books of the Old
      Testament; the apostle says this, to vindicate the pertinency of the above
      citation, and to prevent any objection that might be made against it;
      since whatsoever was written in that psalm did not belong personally to
      David, but to Christ; and what is written concerning him, is designed for
      the use and instruction of his people; yea, whatever is written anywhere
      in the sacred Scriptures,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        were written for our learning; to instruct in the knowledge of Christ,
        of his person, offices, grace, righteousness, obedience, sufferings,
        death, resurrection, and ascension; and of the great salvation and
        redemption he came to obtain, and has obtained; and to teach us the
        doctrines of grace, of pardon through the blood of Christ, atonement by
        his sacrifice, justification by his righteousness, acceptance in his
        person, and eternal life through him; as also to inform us of our duty,
        and how we ought to behave both towards God and men:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have
        hope; the Scriptures are not only written for our present instruction,
        but for the ingenerating, encouraging, and establishing, an hope of
        eternal Life in another world; which they are the means of, under the
        influence of divine grace; since they give us a clear account of eternal
        life; of the promise of it in Christ; of its being procured by him, and
        secured in him; of the means of enjoying it, through his blood and
        righteousness; of the declarations of God's free grace and mercy to
        sinners, and of the various instances of persons who have been made
        partakers of it; all which encourage to hope in the Lord, and to rejoice
        in hope of the glory of God; believing we also may have and enjoy the
        thing hoped for, "through patience and comfort of the Scriptures"; both
        which are encouraged thereby: the "patience of the Scriptures" is not a
        stoical apathy, a stupid indolence; and is of a different kind from that
        patience the writings of the Heathen philosophers define and recommend:
        the Scripture gives an account of the true nature of patience, in
        bearing all sorts of evils for Christ's sake; of the excellency and
        usefulness of it; and do strongly exhort unto it upon the best
        principles, and with the best motives; and are full of promises to the
        exercise of it, and furnish out the best examples of suffering
        affliction, and patience: "the comfort of the Scriptures" is such as is
        not to be met with elsewhere. These writings abound with exceeding great
        and precious promises, and excellent doctrines, big with consolation to
        the saints; and both serve much to cherish, support, and maintain an
        hope of eternal happiness; all which prove the divine authority,
        excellency, and usefulness of the sacred writings, and recommend the
        reading of them by us, and the hearing of them explained by others.

      Now the God of patience and consolation,.... These titles and characters
      of God are manifestly used on account of what is before said concerning
      the Scriptures, and to show, that the efficacy and usefulness of them, in
      producing and promoting patience and comfort, entirely depend upon God the
      author of them: from exhorting, the apostle proceeds to petitioning; well
      knowing that all his exhortations would be of no avail without the power
      of divine grace accompanying them. The words are a prayer. The object
      addressed is described as "the God of patience", because he is the author
      and giver of that grace: it is a fruit of his Spirit, produced by the
      means of his word, called the word of his patience. The Heathens
      themselves were so sensible that this is a divine blessing, that they call
      patience , "the invention of the gods" (w). God is the great pattern and
      exemplar of patience; he is patient himself, and bears much and long with
      the children of men; with wicked men, whose patient forbearance and
      longsuffering being despised by them, will be an aggravation of their
      damnation; but his longsuffering towards his elect issues in their
      salvation: he waits to be gracious to them before conversion, and after it
      bears with their infirmities, heals their backslidings, forgives their
      iniquities, patiently hears their cues, requests, and complaints, relieves
      and supports them, and carries them even to hoary hairs; and is in all a
      pattern to be imitated by his people. He is also the object of this grace;
      he it is on whom and for whom saints should and do patiently wait, until
      he is pleased to manifest himself, and communicate to them for the supply
      of their wants of every sort; and upon whose account and for whose sake
      they patiently suffer reproach and persecution; the exercise of patience
      is what he requires, and calls for, and is very grateful and well pleasing
      to him; to all which add, that he it is who strengthens to the exercise of
      it, and increases it; and which he does sometimes by tribulation; faith
      and other graces, being thereby tried, produce patience; and which at
      length, through divine grace, has its perfect work. Moreover, the object
      of prayer is described, as "the God of consolation"; all true, real, solid
      comfort springs from him, which he communicates by his son, the
      consolation of Israel; by his Spirit, the comforter; by his word, the
      doctrines and promises of which afford strong consolation to the heirs of
      promise, sensible sinners and afflicted souls; by the ordinances of the
      Gospel, which are breasts of consolation; and by the faithful ministers of
      Christ, who are "Barnabases", sons of consolation,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036">Act 4:36</a>. The petition
      follows,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        grant you to be like minded one towards another; which does not respect
        sameness of judgment in the doctrines of faith; though this is very
        necessary to an honourable and comfortable walking together in church
        fellowship; much less an agreement in things indifferent: the apostle's
        meaning is not, that they should all abstain from meats forbidden by the
        law of Moses, or that they should all eat every sort of food without
        distinction; nor that they should all observe any Jewish day, or that
        they should all observe none; rather, that everyone should enjoy his own
        sentiment, and practise as he believed: but this request regards a
        likeness of affection, the sameness of mutual love, that they be of one
        heart, and one soul; that notwithstanding their different sentiments
        about things of a ceremonious kind, yet that they should love one
        another, and cease either to despise or judge each other; but think as
        well and as highly of them that differ from them, as of themselves, and
        of those of their own sentiments, without preferring in affection one to
        another; but studying and devising to promote and maintain, as the
        Syriac here reads it, "an equality" among them; showing the same equal
        affection and respect to one as to the other, and to one another; the
        Jew to the Gentile, and the Gentile to the Jew; the strong to the weak,
        and the weak to the strong. This is what is greatly desirable. It is
        grateful to God; it is earnestly wished for by the ministers of the
        Gospel: and is pleasant and delightful to all good men; but it is God
        alone that can give and continue such a Spirit: this the apostle knew,
        and therefore prays that he would "grant" it: and for which request
        there is a foundation for faith and hope concerning it; since God has
        promised he will give his people one heart, and one way, as to fear him,
        so to love one another. The rule or pattern, according to which this is
        desired, is next expressed,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to Christ Jesus; according to the doctrine of Christ, which
        teaches, directs, and engages, as to sameness of judgment and practice,
        so to mutual love and affection; and according to the new commandment of
        Christ, which obliges to love one another; and according to the example
        of Christ, who is the great pattern of patience and forbearance, of
        meekness and humility, of condescension and goodness, and of equal love
        and affection to all his members.

      That ye may with one mind and one mouth;.... This is the end for which the
      above request is made, and shows, that a cordial and sincere affection for
      one another is necessary to the worshipping of God with one consent, to a
      joining together in acts of religious service, both in praying to God, and
      in praising of him, which latter seems here chiefly designed; for how
      should there be an agreement of heart and voice, of mind and mouth, in
      praising God, unless there is a singleness of heart, and oneness of
      affection? This is necessary in order to
      <p></p>
      <p>
        glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Syriac and
        Arabic versions read, God "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"; leaving
        out, the copulative, which we translate "even", but may as well be
        rendered "and"; and be read, as by some, "the God and Father of our Lord
        Jesus Christ". God is the God of Christ, as Christ is man; who prepared
        the human nature for him, anointed it with the Holy Spirit, supported it
        in life, in sufferings and death, and glorified it at his own right
        hand; and in which nature Christ exercised every grace on him, as faith,
        hope, and love; discharged every duty to him, worshipped him, prayed
        unto him, and was in all things obedient to his will: and God is the
        Father of Christ, as Christ is God; for as man he had no father. Now he
        is "glorified" when the perfections of his nature are ascribed unto him;
        when notice is taken of the works of his hands, and the glory of his
        majesty, which appears in them; when praise is offered up, and thanks
        given for all mercies, temporal and spiritual, he bestows on his people;
        when they join together in the solemn worship of him, presenting their
        bodies, and giving up their hearts unto him; when they unite in praying
        to him, and singing his praise; and when their lives and conversations
        are agreeable to their profession of him.

      Wherefore receive ye one another,.... Into your hearts and affections;
      embrace one another cordially, the Jew the Gentile, the Gentile the Jew,
      the strong brother the weak, the weak the strong:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as Christ also received us. The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin,
        Syriac, and Arabic versions, read "you". Both Jews and Gentiles, as
        appears from the following verses. Christ received all the chosen ones
        into his heart's love and affection from eternity; he received them in
        the council of peace, and when the covenant of grace was made at his
        Father's hands, in the most tender manner, in order to take the care of
        them, preserve and save them; he assumed their nature, took upon him
        their sins, and sustained their persons in time, when he became
        incarnate, and suffered and died for them; and he receives them in the
        effectual calling on their coming to him, which he encourages by
        assuring them, that he will in no wise cast them out; so far is he from
        it, that he embraces them with open arms, and in the most affectionate
        manner receives them, though sinners, and eats with them; and
        notwithstanding all their unworthiness, sins, and transgressions:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to the glory of God: that is, either in order to bring them to the
        enjoyment of eternal life and happiness; which is sometimes so called,
        because of the glory that shall be beheld by the saints, be revealed in
        them, and put upon them, both in soul and body; and which is all of
        God's preparing and bestowing, and will lie in the vision and enjoyment
        of him: for this they were chosen in Christ, given to him, and received
        by him before the world began; and that they might enjoy it, Christ came
        into this world, took on him their persons, and died in their stead; and
        to this they are called by his grace with an holy calling; and when he
        has guided them with his counsel through this world, he will receive
        them to this glory: or else by "the glory of God" is meant the
        glorifying of God, the perfections of God, as his wisdom, power,
        faithfulness, truth, justice, holiness, love, grace, and mercy, and the
        like; which is done by Christ's becoming the surety, and Mediator of the
        new covenant (Heb 7:22) by
        his assumption of human nature, by his obedience, sufferings, and death,
        and by obtaining redemption for his people: and the force of the
        apostle's exhortation and argument is, that as Christ has received his
        people both in eternity and time, in so tender a manner, though
        unworthy, whereby he has glorified God, which was the principal end in
        view, and next to that the glorifying of them; so it becomes them to be
        like minded to one another (Rom 15:5) and
        affectionately receive and embrace each other, that so they may join
        together in glorifying the God and Father of Christ also,

      Now I say,.... Or affirm that Christ has received both Jews and Gentiles:
      that he has received the Jews, and therefore they are not to be despised,
      though they are weak, appears from hence,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision; he is rightly
        called a minister, for this was the end of his coming into the world,
        and the whole of his work in it was not to be ministered unto, but to
        minister to others (Mat 20:28) both in life
        and at death. This character agrees with him in all his offices; as King
        he ministers judgment to the people; and as priest he is the minister of
        the true tabernacle of the human nature (Heb 8:2) in which he
        offered himself a sacrifice for the sins of his people, and now in it
        makes intercession for them; but here it is expressive of his prophetic
        office, in which he is such a minister as never was before, or since, or
        ever will be; if we consider the dignity of his person, being the Son of
        God; the greatness of his qualifications, having the Spirit without
        measure; the nature of his doctrines, which were amazing words of grace
        and truth; and the manner of his delivery, which was with authority; and
        that all other ministers receive their mission, qualifications, doctrine
        and success from him: he is styled a minister of "the circumcision", not
        literally considered, as if he administered circumcision to any, which
        he did not; he was indeed subject to it as a son of Abraham, as a Jew by
        birth, as under the law, and in order to fulfil all righteousness (Mat 3:15) and to show that
        he was truly man, and that he had regard to the people and ordinances of
        the Old Testament, as he showed by baptism he had to those of the New,
        and to signify our cleansing and atonement by his blood; but
        circumcision is either to be understood in a spiritual sense of
        circumcision in the Spirit, and not in the flesh, with which the true
        circumcision, or believers in Christ, are circumcised in him, through
        his circumcision; or rather the word here is to be taken metonymically,
        for the uncircumcised Jews, as it often is in this epistle; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026">Rom 2:26</a>. So that the
        meaning is, that Christ was their minister and preacher, just as Peter
        is said to have the apostleship of the circumcision (Gal 2:8) or to be the
        apostle of the Jews; as Paul was of the Gentiles (Rom 11:13) and to have the
        Gospel of the circumcision committed to him, it being his province to
        preach it to them (Gal 2:7) Christ as a
        minister or preacher in the personal discharge of his prophetic office,
        was sent only to the Jews; among them he lived, and to them he only
        preached; nor did he allow his apostles to preach to any other till
        after his resurrection; and which is a manifest proof that he received
        the Jews, and took them under his care, and showed a particular regard
        unto them: the ends of his being a minister to them were,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for the truth of God; to preach the Gospel of salvation, the word of
        truth unto them, for which he was promised and sent; and in doing of
        which he declared the righteousness, faithfulness, loving kindness, and
        truth of God unto them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; the fathers of the
        world, Adam, Noah, &amp;c. or rather the Jewish fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
        Jacob, Moses, David, and others; concerning the Messiah's being the seed
        of the woman, and of Abraham, and of David; concerning the coming of
        Shiloh, the raising up of the great prophet among the Jews, &amp;c. all
        which promises are yea and amen in Christ, ratified and fulfilled in
        him.

      And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy,.... In choosing
      them in Christ as vessels of mercy, and in redeeming them by Christ as
      well as the Jews, and in regenerating and calling them by his abundant
      grace; and which as they clearly show that Christ has received them, and
      therefore are not to be censured and judged as irreligious persons,
      because of the use of their Christian liberty; so these things lay them
      under obligations to glorify God, to show forth his praise both by lip and
      life, since what they enjoy is not by promise, as the Jews, but of mere
      mercy; not but that promises arise from grace and mercy, though the
      accomplishment of them is owing to truth and faithfulness; but the
      Gentiles had no promises made to them, and yet obtained mercy, though
      there were many promises made concerning them, and many oracles and
      predictions in favour of them stood on divine record; some of which the
      apostle here produces to prove what he had asserted, that Christ had
      received them, and they were bound to glorify God on that account:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as it is written, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049">Psa 18:49</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto
        thy name; which words are not spoken unto God by David, literally,
        considered, but as representing the Messiah; for David when he penned
        this Psalm, was in the decline of life; the next account after this is
        of his last dying words,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#001">Sa2 23:1</a>; nor could he
        hope to praise God among the Gentiles, nor did he in person, but in his
        Son the Messiah. These words are the words of Christ unto his Father,
        who in the title of the psalm is called "the servant of God", he being
        the Mediator eminently; he is represented as encompassed with the
        sorrows and snares of death and the grave, which agree with Jesus when
        in the garden, and on the cross. God is all along in it spoken as his
        helper and deliverer, as he was to Christ in his human nature, having
        promised to be so, and on which he depended; and the person, the subject
        of the psalm, is a victorious person, one that has got the conquest over
        all enemies, which is in the fullest sense true of the Messiah, who has
        overcome the world, made an end of sin, destroyed Satan, spoiled
        principalities and powers, and abolished death; and particularly is said
        to be the head of the Heathen, and they to be voluntary subjects to him (Psa 18:43) which is
        expressed in much the same language as the like things are in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#004">Isa 55:4</a>; which is so
        manifest a prophecy of the Messiah; add to all which, that the Lord's
        anointed, the King Messiah, and who is called David, is expressly
        mentioned in the words following these that are cited, and which are
        applied by the Jews (x) themselves to the Messiah; as is
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#032">Psa 18:32</a> paraphrased of
        him, by the Targumist upon it: what is here said by the Messiah to God,
        is that he would "confess to him among the Gentiles"; which is to be
        understood not of confession of sin, or of a confession of faith in him;
        but of praise and thanksgiving, a celebration of his perfections,
        particularly his, race, mercy, and goodness; ascribing honour and glory
        to him, either for the conversion of the Gentiles, as he did in the
        believing Jews (Act 11:18)
        or by the mouth of the Gentiles, for what God had done in bringing the
        Gospel to them (Act 13:48)
        or among them, by his apostles and ministers of the Gospel being made
        very successful among them, and made to triumph in Christ, whilst they
        diffused the savour of his knowledge in every place. The word "Lord" is
        omitted in this citation, though it appears in the Vulgate Latin and
        Arabic versions, and in the Complutensian edition, and two of Stephens's
        copies: "and sing unto thy name"; psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to
        the glory of his grace, as in all the churches of the Gentiles, to which
        they are directed by the Spirit of Christ,

      And again he saith,.... God or Christ, in

      <p></p>
      <p>
        rejoice ye Gentiles with his people; which from the Hebrew text are by
        some rendered, "rejoice his people O ye Gentiles"; to which agree the
        Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, who render it, "praise O ye nations his
        people"; or as some copies of the former, "the judgment of his people";
        and the latter adds, the house of Israel. The note of R. Sol. Jarchi on
        the text is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "at that time the nations shall praise Israel; see what is the praise of
        this people that cleave unto the Lord, &amp;c.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But the design of this song is to praise God, and not the people of
        Israel; who in it are severely reproved for their many iniquities, and
        especially their very great ingratitude to God, and are threatened with
        the heaviest judgments. This is seen by other Jewish writers, who
        interpret the words accordingly, as R. Aben Ezra does, whose note is
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"then shall they praise him, when God shall avenge their blood;''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and to this sense is the Jerusalem Targum,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "praise before him O ye people, praise him O his people of the house of
        Israel;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but the words may be better translated either thus, "rejoice O ye
        nations, his people"; that is, ye Gentiles who are his people, whom God
        has taken into his covenant, and whom he will declare as such in his own
        time, which time was now come, and therefore had reason to rejoice; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">Pe1 2:9</a>; or thus, "rejoice
        ye Gentiles, and his people"; let both Jews and Gentiles rejoice; let
        them rejoice together when they come to be fellow heirs, and of the same
        body, and partakers of the same promises and privileges; when they shall
        be together in one fold, under one shepherd; and especially when the
        fulness of each of them is brought in, and God has avenged himself of
        his and their enemies; and which agrees with the apostle's sense, and
        whose version is supported by the Septuagint interpreters; and his
        supplement is to be justified, there only wanting a copulative in the
        Hebrew text, which is often the case in that language, and which may
        easily be supplied by "and" or "with"; as it is with the latter by the
        apostle, in perfect agreement with the sense of the words.

      <p>
        praise the Lord all ye Gentiles, and laud him all ye people; that is,

        Jews for his truth and faithfulness in the fulfilment of his praises. R.
        David Kimchi on this psalm observes, that

        "it consists of two verses only, and that it belongs , "to the days of

      And again Esaias saith,.... In
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</a>;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        there shall be a root of Jesse. This prophecy is applied to the Messiah
        by the Jews (y), who say,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that when the King Messiah is revealed, there shall be gathered to him
        all the nations of the world, so that that Scripture shall be fulfilled
        which is written, "there shall be a root of Jesse", &amp;c.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This character, "the root of Jesse", may be understood of Christ with
        respect to his divine nature, who, as God, was before Jesse, and the
        author of his being, as of all creatures; just in such sense as he is
        called "the root and offspring of David",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#005">Rev 5:5</a>; the root of
        David, as he is God, and the offspring of David, as he is man; unless
        both are to be interpreted of his human nature, as the phrase here also
        may be, and denote his descent from Jesse as man; and so the Jewish
        writers interpret it as well as some Christian ones. This is R. David
        Kimchi's comment;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        ""and there shall be a root of Jesse"; the meaning is, , "which goes out
        from the root of Jesse", according to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</a>, for "Jesse" is
        the root. And so the Targum of Jonathan, , "the son's son of Jesse";''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that is, David's son, the King Messiah, who sprung from Jesse's family,
        when that family was very low and mean, like to a tree cut down to, its
        roots, and to a root in a dry ground; out of which sprung the man the
        branch, David's son and Lord. This character may be applied to Christ as
        Mediator, who as a root is unseen and unknown to carnal men, and mean,
        abject, and of no account in the eyes of the world; the root that not
        only bears Jesse, David, and other good men, but all the branches of
        God's elect, from whom they have their beings, both in a natural and
        spiritual sense; which communicates life and nourishment to them; in
        whom their life is hid, and is safe when scarcely to be discerned in
        them; and from whom they have all their fruitfulness, and to whom is
        owing their perseverance in faith and holiness.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; or, as the Syriac
        version, "and he that shall rise shall be a prince unto the Gentiles";
        or, as the Arabic, "and he that shall rise out of it", the root, "shall
        rule over the Gentiles". In the Hebrew text in Isaiah, this is said of
        the root, and to be read thus, "which shall stand for an ensign of the
        people",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</a>; because mention
        is made of a root, the apostle expresses the standing of it by rising
        out of it, which signifies both the incarnation and exaltation of
        Christ; and because an ensign is a token of power and government,
        therefore he has rendered it to "reign", agreeably enough to the sense;
        since upon Christ's exaltation, and setting up his ensign or standard,
        the Gospel, in the Gentile world, multitudes became voluntary subjects
        to him, and still do; over whom he rules by his grace and Spirit, and
        will more largely and manifestly in the latter day, when the kingdoms of
        this world shall be his. In like manner R. Aben. Ezra explains the words
        of the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Says he, this may be understood, for all the whole world shall be ,
        "under his power", or government.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And so the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases them, "and kingdoms shall obey
        him"; so that the Jew can have no reason to complain of the apostle's
        version.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        In him shall the Gentiles trust, or "hope"; this in the Hebrew text is,
        "to him shall the Gentiles seek"; which cannot be truly done without
        faith and hope; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006">Heb 11:6</a>; for the hope and
        faith of enjoying what is sought for, put persons upon seeking: so that
        the apostle here gives us the true sense of the words, and most fully
        describes the affection of the Gentiles to Christ; who having some
        knowledge of him, seek unto him for life and salvation, prostrate
        themselves at his feet, venture upon him, commit themselves to him, and
        hope and trust in him. This part of the prophecy is by the Jews
        understood of the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "All the Gentiles (says R. David Kimchi on the text) shall seek , "to
        the Messiah", and shall go after him to do what he commands; all of them
        shall obey him.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But why no mention made of the Israelites seeking to the Messiah? hear
        what they say, and which still confirms the sense of these words (z).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "The Israelites will have no need of the doctrine of the King Messiah in
        future time, as it is said, "to him shall the Gentiles seek", and not
        the Israelites.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        True enough! The apostle dwells on the proof of this point, it not being
        so easy of belief with the Jews, but makes it clear from the law,
        psalms, and prophets, which is the threefold division of the writings of
        the Old Testament; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044">Luk 24:44</a>.

      Now the God of hope,.... This character is taken from the latter part of
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#012">Rom 15:12</a>, and is occasioned
      by it, "in him shall the Gentiles trust", or "hope"; and is proper to God
      as he is the author and giver of this grace; for naturally men are without
      it; that which is a good hope is the gift of God, and through his grace,
      and is wrought in the heart in regeneration; for to this are the children
      of God begotten again. Moreover, God is the object of it; not wealth and
      riches, nor works of righteousness, but Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit,
      particularly Christ, is called the believer's hope; that is, the object of
      it, in whom the Gentiles hope and trust. Likewise, it is God that
      encourages to the exercise of it by the proclamations of his grace, and
      mercy, and plenteous redemption; by the discoveries of his love, and views
      of interest in him; and by bringing to mind the past experiences of his
      goodness: he preserves and maintains this grace useful and lively, firm
      and steadfast, at least in being, which sometimes seems almost perished
      and gone; he increases it, and causes his people to abound in the exercise
      of it, and continues it even unto death. The Ethiopic version reads, "the
      God of our promises", which are what hope has respect unto, and builds
      upon:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        fill you with all joy and peace in believing. This is a petition to the
        God of hope. The apostle has recourse again to prayer, knowing that all
        his exhortations would be useless, without the grace of God accompanying
        them: and it is observable, that he prays for the same things mentioned
        in the above prophecies and promises, as joy, peace, and hope; for
        though God has promised ever so great things concerning his people, he
        will be inquired of by them to do them for them. One part of this
        petition is, that God would "fill them with all joy"; not with every
        kind of joy; not with worldly joy, or with the joy of hypocrites, who
        rejoice in sin, or in their own boastings, which is evil; but with
        spiritual joy, joy in God as a covenant God and Father; in Christ, in
        his person, righteousness, and salvation; and in the Holy Ghost, the
        author of it, whose fruit it is; and in the Gospel, doctrines,
        blessings, and promises of it; and in the view and hope of the heavenly
        glory, amidst various afflictions and tribulations: and it designs an
        abundance of it, even a fulness thereof; though the petition implies,
        that as yet it is not full; it is frequently interrupted and broke in
        upon by the corruption of nature, and falls into sin, by the temptations
        of Satan, through divine desertions, and various trials and exercises;
        yet it supposes it may be increased, as by the renewed discoveries of
        the love of God, of interest in Christ, and through the gracious
        influences of the Spirit; and even made full and complete, though not in
        this, yet in the other world: another branch of the petition is, that
        God would fill with "peace", with a sense of their peace with him, made
        by the blood of Christ; with a conscience peace in their own breasts,
        arising from a view of their justification by the righteousness of
        Christ, and from the sprinklings of his blood upon them; and also with
        peace one among another, which was much wanting, and the apostle was
        very desirous of: and all this he asks, that it might come to them "in
        believing"; in the way of faith, and the exercise of that grace; for joy
        comes this way; faith and joy go together; where one is, the other is
        also; and as the one increases, so does the other; a believing view of
        interest in Christ is attended with joy unspeakable, and full of glory:
        and so peace comes in at the door of faith: there is no true peace till
        a soul is brought to believe in Christ; and that is promoted and
        increased by repeated acts of faith on Christ, or by a constant living
        by faith on him; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#003">Isa 26:3</a>. The end for
        which this petition is made is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost. By hope
        is meant that grace which God is the author, object, and promoter of;
        and the Syriac version reads it, "in his hope", or "the hope of him"; of
        enjoying him, of meeting with him, and having communion with him in his
        house and ordinances; of having fresh supplies of grace from him, and of
        being favoured with all the blessings of grace laid up in an everlasting
        covenant, and at last with eternal life and glory: to "abound" herein,
        is to be in the free and frequent exercise of this grace, being
        encouraged by the grace of God, and an enlarged experience of it, and
        supported by faith, the substance of things hoped for: and this "through
        the power of the Holy Ghost"; not by might or power of man, but by that
        same divine power which first began the good work, and must fulfil it;
        which at first implanted the grace of hope, and must perform the work of
        that, as of faith. The same power is requisite to cause grace to abound,
        or saints to abound in the exercise of it, as was to the first
        production of it. The Vulgate Latin reads, "that ye may abound in hope,
        and in the power of the Holy Ghost"; but there is no copulative in the
        Greek text.
