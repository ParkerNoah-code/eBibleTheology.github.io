      For which cause also,.... By reason of being employed for so many years,
      in preaching the Gospel from Jerusalem, round about to Illyricum; taking
      so large a compass to minister in, and striving to introduce, propagate,
      and spread the Gospel, where Christ was never named before:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I have been much hindered from coming to you; or he had been often, and
        by many ways, and upon many accounts, hindered from coming to them; the
        frequent calls to different and distant places, and the great work of
        preaching the Gospel in those dark parts of the world, and settling
        churches there, which was upon his hands, prevented his giving them a
        visit at Rome, which he much and often desired: as in the preceding
        verses the apostle excuses his freedom of writing to this church, so
        here his long delay of coming to them, assigning the reason of it.

      </p>
      But now having no more place in these parts,.... Not because persecution
      was too hot for him, and therefore could not stay any longer, for this was
      what he expected everywhere; nor did it discourage him in his work, for he
      took pleasure in enduring it for the sake of Christ and his Gospel; but
      because he had fully preached the Gospel from Jerusalem, in his circuit to
      Illyricum, had filled every town and city with it, had planted churches in
      every place, and ordained elders over them, to whom the care and charge of
      them were committed; that there were no more places for him to preach in,
      but either where he himself had been already, or some other of the
      apostles; not but that he could have stayed with usefulness to these new
      formed churches, for the edifying and confirming of them, for the
      furtherance of the joy of faith in them, and for the defence of the Gospel
      and its ordinances among them; but his proper work as an apostle being to
      preach the Gospel to all nations, and where Christ was not named, and to
      plant churches; and there being no more room in these climates, or
      regions, for such service, he begins to think of some other places,
      particularly Spain, where as yet very probably the Gospel was not
      preached: however, he found himself at leisure to visit other places, and
      hereby gives the church at Rome some hopes of seeing him from this
      consideration, as well as from what follows:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; he had not
        only a desire, but a very vehement desire to come to them; he longed to
        see them, as he elsewhere says; so that since now he had leisure, they
        might hope it would not be long ere they did see him; especially as the
        thing had been upon his mind and thoughts for many years past; which
        shows that the Gospel had been preached very early at Rome, that many
        had been converted by it, and a church had been formed there some years
        ago, and was known to the apostle; on which account, having heard much
        of their faith and obedience, he had a longing desire of a great while
        to see them.

      Whensoever I take my journey into Spain,.... Which he had now meditated
      and resolved upon, being a place, as before observed, where it is very
      likely the Gospel as yet had not been preached, which made him desirous of
      going thither; but whether he ever went thither, or not, is not certain;
      some think he never performed the intended journey; others affirm he did,
      some time between his two appearances before Nero. Sepharad, in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#020">Oba 1:20</a>, is taken by the
      Jewish writers for this country; and is by the Targum, Jarchi, and Aben
      Ezra on that place, called "Aspamia"; a name not greatly different from
      Hispania, by which it usually goes among the Greeks and Latins; but Kimchi
      calls it "Spania", the very word used in this place, and by us rendered
      "Spain", as it is usually called: it was called "Span" in the language of
      the Celtic, who first inhabited it, which signifies a companion; it was
      formerly called Iberia, from the river Iberus; afterwards Hesperia, from
      Hesperus, the brother of Atlas; and then Hispalia, from the city Hispalis,
      or Sevil; and from thence corruptly Hispania; there are some that derive
      it from from the roughness of some places in it, barren, uncultivated, and
      uninhabited: it has on the east the Pyrenean mountains, by which it is
      divided from France, on the west the Atlantic ocean, on the north the
      Cantabrian, and on the south the Herculean sea, and the straits of Gades:
      now as the apostle intended a journey into this country; he mentions it,
      in order to raise their expectations of seeing him; since in his way
      thither, he would have a fair opportunity of coming to them; yea, he
      assures them, that whenever he went thither, he would come:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I will come to you: it was his real intention, a settled resolution and
        determination in his mind so to do; but whereas everything of this kind
        depends not upon the will of man, but upon the will and providence of
        God, and so many unforeseen things fall out which prevent the fulfilling
        of human purposes, therefore he adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>for I trust, or "hope"</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to see you in my journey: he could not be certain that he should see
        them, but he hoped he should, for nothing was more desirable to him; his
        wish was not to see their emperor, their senate, or their famous city,
        but them, the church of Christ there; and a beautiful and delightful
        sight it is, to see a church of Christ in Gospel order, walking together
        in the faith and fellowship, and ordinances of it, and in peace one with
        another:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and to be brought on my way thitherward by you; he not only hoped to see
        them, but that he should have the company of some of them along with
        him, in his way to Spain; from whose conversation he might expect much
        spiritual pleasure and refreshment; and by whom he might be directed in
        his way, as well as supplied with all necessaries for his journey; in
        which sense the phrase of bringing on in the way, is sometimes used; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#013">Tit 3:13</a>; though before he
        should depart from them, he hoped to have abundance of satisfaction in
        his conversation with them together as a church:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>if first I be somewhat, or in part,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        filled with your company; or with you, meaning that before he should set
        forward from them to Spain, that he should be greatly delighted with
        beholding their order, and the steadfastness of their faith, hearing
        their sweet experiences, and observing their holy life and conversation,
        and their peace and concord among themselves; not that he expected
        entire satisfaction, a satiety of pleasure, fulness of joy, which are
        only to be had in the presence of God, and communion with angels and
        glorified saints; though perhaps he might expect more than he had, for
        at his first answer before Nero, all these Romans forsook him and fled;
        saints are often disappointed in their raised expectations of what they
        shall enjoy in each other's company.

      But now I go unto Jerusalem,.... Whither he was bound in spirit, not
      knowing what should befall him there, from which he could not be dissuaded
      by his friends, and thither he did go:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to minister unto the saints; not to preach the Gospel, though doubtless
        he did that when he was there; but to distribute among the poor saints
        what had been raised for them by the Greek churches; who had entreated
        him to take upon him this service, even the fellowship of ministering to
        the saints; and though this might seem below his office as an apostle,
        and as what more became an inferior officer, a deacon in a church; yet
        the apostle's heart was so much in it, and he was so bent upon it, and
        so diligent to execute it, that he postponed his journey to Spain and
        visit to Rome for the sake of it, and assigns this as a reason why he
        could not come at present.
