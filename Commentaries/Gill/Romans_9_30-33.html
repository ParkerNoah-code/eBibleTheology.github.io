      What shall we say then?.... To God's calling of a large number of the
      Gentiles, and only a very few of the Jews, according to his eternal
      purposes and decrees; what can be objected to it? is he chargeable with
      any unrighteousness? must it not be referred to his sovereign will and
      pleasure? is it not an instance of his grace and goodness, that he calls
      and saves some, when they were all so wicked, that he might in justice
      have destroyed every individual of them? or what is further to be said,
      concerning both Jews and Gentiles? or what can be objected to what may be
      further observed concerning them? as
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness; the very same
        persons among them, who are, called by grace, and are vessels of mercy,
        before their calling were without a righteousness, stout hearted, and
        far from one; being without Christ, and destitute of his Spirit; they
        were ignorant of righteousness, of the righteousness of God, and of his
        law, and consequently of what true righteousness is; they were
        unconcerned about it, and did not labour after it, as the Jews did. They
        did not pursue and improve the light of nature, about God and things of
        a moral kind, as they might have done; but held the light and truth they
        had in unrighteousness, and indeed were filled with nothing else: and
        yet these persons
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of
        faith. The righteousness they attained unto, was not a righteousness of
        their own, not the righteousness of works, or a righteousness by the
        deeds of the law, to which the righteousness which is of faith is always
        opposed; nor faith itself, which is distinguished from it; but the
        righteousness of Christ, so called, not because that faith is the cause
        or condition of it, but because the discovery of it is made to faith;
        that receives it, lays hold on it, and exercises itself on it; by it the
        soul renounces its own righteousness, looks to, and depends on Christ's,
        and rejoices in it. These Gentiles being called by grace, "attained",
        "comprehended", or "apprehended" this righteousness; not by the light of
        nature, which makes no discovery, nor gives the least hint of it; but by
        the light of faith they apprehended it, as revealed in the Gospel; which
        faith they had not of themselves, but of God; so that the whole of this
        account is a wonderful instance of the grace of God, and abundantly
        confirms the observation made before by the apostle, that "it is not of
        him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that shows mercy",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016">Rom 9:16</a>; since these
        persons had nothing in them, disposing and qualifying them for a
        justifying righteousness, and yet attained one; and the grace appears to
        be the more distinguishing, by what follows.

      </p>
      But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,.... The
      Israelites, the far greater part of the Jews, who were not called by the
      grace of God, were all very zealous of the law, called "the law of
      righteousness"; because the matter of it was righteous, it was so in its
      own nature; and because perfect obedience to it is righteousness; as also
      because they sought for righteousness by the deeds of it. They very
      violently and eagerly pursued after it, they tugged and toiled, and
      laboured with all their might, as persons in running a race, to get up to
      the law, and the righteousness of it; and yet Israel, with all the pains
      and labour taken,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        hath not attained to the law of righteousness: some of them fancied they
        had, supposing an external conformity to it, to be all that it insisted
        upon; not knowing the spirituality of it, that it required truth and
        holiness in the inward parts; and that he that offended in one point of
        it, was guilty of all, and therefore could not be justified by it.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032">Romans 9:32</a>

      </p>
      Wherefore? because they sought it not by faith,.... The question is asked,
      why they did not attain to that, which with so much diligence they pressed
      after? the answer is, because, as they did not seek for righteousness in a
      right place, or object, they sought for it in the law, and the works of
      it, where it is never to be found by a sinful creature, and not in Christ,
      in whom only are righteousness and strength; so they did not seek for it
      in a right way, by faith in Christ, without which it is impossible to
      please God, and by which only true righteousness is discerned and
      received:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but as it were by the works of the law; not by works which looked like
        works of the law, and were not; but they sought it as if they expected
        their justification before God was to be by works of righteousness done
        by them; or as if it was partly by their own works, and partly by the
        goodness of God, accepting of them for a justifying righteousness. The
        Alexandrian Copy, and some others, read only, "as it were by works"; and
        so does the Vulgate Latin version: another reason, or else a reason of
        the former is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for they stumbled at that stumbling stone; meaning the word of the
        Gospel, at which Peter says they stumbled, and particularly the doctrine
        of justification by the righteousness of Christ; or rather Christ
        himself, who was "to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks
        foolishness",

      </p>
      As it is written,.... In
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</a>; for the beginning
      and end of this citation are out of the latter, and the middle of it out
      of the former. This is an instance of "skipping", from place to place,
      concerning which the rules with the Jews were (s), that the reader
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "might skip from text to text, but he might not skip from prophet to
        prophet, except only in the twelve prophets, only he might not skip from
        the end of the book to the beginning; also they might skip in the
        prophets, but not in the law;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which rules are exactly complied with by the apostle. The beginning of
        this citation is out of
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016">Isa 28:16</a>,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        behold I lay in Zion. The "stone" said to be laid in Zion, is by the
        "Chaldee paraphrast" interpreted of a "king"; by R. David Kimchi, of
        King Hezekiah, and by Jarchi of the King Messiah; and is truly applied
        by the apostle to Jesus Christ: the layer of this stone is God the
        Father, who laid him as the foundation stone, in his eternal purposes
        and decrees, in his counsels and covenant, in promise and in prophecy,
        in the mission of him into this world, and in the preaching of the
        everlasting Gospel: the place where he is laid is Zion, meaning either
        literally Judea or Jerusalem, where the Messiah was to appear, whither
        he came, and from whence his Gospel went forth; or mystically the
        church, where he is laid as the foundation of it, and of the salvation
        of all the members thereof; though, through the sin and unbelief of
        others, he proves to be
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a stumbling stone, and rock of offence; which phrases are to be seen in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</a>, and are spoken
        of, and ascribed to a divine person, even to the Lord of hosts; and are
        by the Targumist thus paraphrased, "and if ye obey not", "his word shall
        be for revenge, and for a stone smiting, and a rock of offence", and in
        the Talmud (t), it is said, that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "the son of David (the Messiah) shall not come until the two houses of
        the fathers are destroyed out of Israel; and these are the head of the
        captivity which is in Babylon, and the prince in the land of Israel, as
        it is said,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</a>.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        So that, according to the ancient Jews, this passage belongs to the
        Messiah, and is properly made use of for this purpose by the apostle,
        who had seen the accomplishment of it in the Jews; who stumbled at the
        outward meanness of Jesus of Nazareth, at his parentage, the manner of
        his birth, his education, the mean appearance of himself and followers;
        at his company and audience, his ministry, miracles, death, and the
        manner of it; and so believed not in him, for righteousness, life, and
        salvation; and thus it came about that they did not attain, or come up
        to the law of righteousness, or the righteousness of the law: but
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed; that is, who believes
        in Christ unto righteousness, who builds his faith, and hope of eternal
        salvation on him, the foundation God has laid in Zion, and at which the
        unbelieving Jews stumbled and fell; he shall neither be ashamed here nor
        hereafter: he shall not be ashamed of his faith and hope in Christ; nor
        of Christ, as the Lord his righteousness; nor shall he be ashamed or
        confounded at his appearing, but shall be justified before men and
        angels, and be received into his kingdom and glory. There is some
        difference between the passage as here cited, and as it stands in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016">Isa 28:16</a>, where it is
        read, "he that believeth shall not make haste": either to lay any other
        foundation, being fully satisfied with this, which is laid by God; or
        shall not make haste to flee away, through fear of any enemy, or of any
        danger, being safe as built on this foundation; and so shall never fall,
        be moved, or ashamed and confounded. Some have fancied a various
        reading, but without any reason. A very learned Oriental critic (u) of
        our own nation has observed, that the Arabic words "Haush" "Hish" answer
        to the Hebrew word, the prophet uses, and which have three
        significations in them, "hasten", to "fear", and be "ashamed"; the first
        of these is retained here by the Jewish commentators and modern
        versions; the second by the "Chaldee paraphrast", and Syriac
        translation; and the third by the Septuagint, and the apostle; and they
        may be all taken into sense, for he that is afraid runs about here and
        there, and at length is put to shame and confusion.
