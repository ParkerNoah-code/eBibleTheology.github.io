      Let love be without dissimulation,.... The apostle having given out
      suitable exhortations to the officers of this church, ministers and
      deacons, proceeds to stir up to the exercise of grace, and the discharge
      of such duties as were common to all the members of the church; and begins
      with "love", which is the cement of saints, and the bond of perfectness,
      without which all the gifts that men have, the profession they make, and
      works they do are of no avail, and they themselves nothing. Here it is to
      be taken, in the largest and most comprehensive sense, for love to God,
      Christ, the saints, and fellow creatures, and ought, with respect to each,
      to "be without dissimulation"; or "hypocrisy": love to God should be with
      all the heart, soul, and mind, otherwise the fear of him, and obedience to
      him, will be only outward, formal, customary, and hypocritical; love to
      Christ should be with sincerity, and so it is where it is right, hearty,
      and genuine; such can appeal to him as the searcher of hearts, that from
      the heart they love him; and love to one another should be not in word,
      and in tongue only, but in deed and in truth; yea, the love professed to
      fellow creatures, ought never to be through fear of men or mercenary
      views, but honest, upright, and sincere.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Abhor that which is evil; sin, both in its principle and in its actings;
        it being hateful to God, Father, Son, and Spirit, contrary to the
        nature, being, and perfections of God, a transgression of his righteous
        law, exceeding sinful in itself, and pernicious in its effects and
        consequences; for all which it is to be abhorred by the saints: the word
        here used, designs the greatest aversation imaginable, a turning away
        from it, as what is the most loathsome, detestable, and abominable; and
        such an hatred of it with horror, as of the Stygian lake, or hell
        itself:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        cleave to that which is good; to God, who is originally, infinitely, and
        immutably good; who is good in his nature, and works, and to all his
        creatures, and especially his chosen people, and therefore should be
        cleaved unto; to his will, his ways, and worship; and to Christ the good
        shepherd of the sheep, the Lamb that is to be followed and cleaved unto,
        whithersoever he goes; and to the good Spirit of God, after whom we
        should walk, and not after the flesh; and to the good people of God,
        assembling with whom should not be forsaken; and to the good Gospel of
        Christ, and the truths of it, which should be held fast; and to the
        ordinances of the Gospel, which ought to be constantly attended on; and
        to every good work, to which we should be ready, careful to maintain,
        and ever follow, both among ourselves and all men: they should even be
        glued unto it, as the word here signifies.

      Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love,.... This is one
      branch of that love, before advised to, which should be unfeigned, and
      without guile and deceit. The objects of this grace are "brethren", not in
      such sense as all the descendants of Adam are, or men of the same country
      be, or as such who are born of the same parents in a natural sense are; to
      each of whom love is due under their respective characters and relations:
      but such who are so in a spiritual sense, who are born of God, are of his
      household, belong to his family, are the brethren of Christ, and one
      another; and are either members of the same church, incorporated together
      in the same church state, or at least members of Christ, and of the church
      universal. Now love to these should be kind, tender, and affectionate,
      reciprocal and mutual; such should love one another; there should be no
      love wanting on either side; and it ought to be universal, and reach to
      all the saints, though of different gifts, light, knowledge and
      experience, or whether high or low, rich or poor; and should show itself
      by bearing one another's burdens, bearing with, and forbearing each other,
      forgiving one another, and by edifying one another in their most holy
      faith, and praying with, and for one another.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        In honour preferring one another; saints should think honourably of one
        another, and entertain an honourable esteem of each other; yea, should
        esteem each other better thou themselves; and not indulge evil surmises,
        and groundless jealousies of one another, which is contrary to that love
        that thinks no evil. They should speak honourably of each other in
        Christian company, and discourage that evil practice of whisperings,
        backbitings, and innuendos; they should treat each other with honour and
        respect in their common conversation, and especially when met together
        as a church of Christ. They should go before each other in giving
        honour, and showing respect, as the word signifies: they should set each
        other an example; and which also may be taken into the sense of the
        word, should prevent one another, not waiting until respect is shown on
        one side to return it again. Nor does this rule at all break in upon
        that order that should subsist, and be maintained in bodies civil and
        ecclesiastical, which requires superior honour to be given to persons
        according to their character, office, and station in which they are.

      Not slothful in business,.... Meaning not worldly business, or the affairs
      of life; though slothfulness in this respect is scandalous to human
      nature, and especially in persons under a profession of religion; men
      should diligently pursue their lawful callings for the support of
      themselves and families, and the interest of Christ: but spiritual
      business, the affairs of piety and religion, the service of God, private
      and public, to which we should not be backward, nor slothful in the
      performance of; such as preaching, hearing, reading, praying, and other
      ordinances of God; yea, we should be ready and forward to every good work,
      and particularly, and which may be here greatly designed, ministering to
      the poor saints in their necessity; in doing which we show that kind,
      tender, affectionate, brotherly love, and give that honour and respect, at
      least that part of it, which is relief, required in the foregoing verse;
      see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#010">Heb 6:10</a>. Remarkable is that
      saying of R. Tarphon (m),
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "The day is short, and the work great, , "and workmen slothful", and the
        reward much, and the master of the house is urgent.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Fervent in spirit; in their own spirits, for the glory of God, the
        honour of Christ, and the cause of religion, in imitation of Christ
        himself, and as Phinehas and Elijah were; which fervency of spirit is
        opposed to that lukewarmness of soul,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#016">Rev 3:16</a>, that coldness of
        affection, and leaving of the first love,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#004">Rev 2:4</a>, so much
        complained of, and resented by Christ in his people: or else in the
        Spirit of God; for there may be fervency in men's spirits, which comes
        not from the Spirit of God, as in the Jews, and particularly Saul,
        before his conversion, who had "a zeal of God, but not according to
        knowledge", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#002">Rom 10:2</a>; but
        when "the love of God is shed abroad in the heart" by the Spirit of God,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#005">Rom 5:5</a>, this will make a
        man's spirit fervent in the service of God, for which the apostle would
        have these believers concerned. A disciple of the wise men among the
        Jews is (n) said to be "fervent", because the law is as a boiling pot
        unto him; much more should a disciple of Christ be fervent, who has the
        Gospel of Christ, the love of God, and the grace of the Spirit to
        inflame his soul with true zeal and fervour.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Serving the Lord; some copies read, "serving time": the likeness of the
        words, and especially in an abbreviation, may have occasioned this
        different reading; which should it be followed, is not to be understood
        in an ill sense, of temporizing, or time serving, of men's accommodating
        themselves, their sentiments and conduct, according to the times in
        which they live, in order to escape reproach and persecution; but of
        redeeming the time, improving every season to do good, and taking every
        opportunity of serving God. But as the reading our version follows is
        confirmed by authentic copies, and by the Syriac, and other Oriental
        versions, it is best to adhere to it: by "the Lord" is here meant either
        God, Father, Son, and Spirit, who are the alone object of divine service
        and religious worship; or the Lord Jesus Christ, who most frequently
        goes by the name of Lord in the New Testament; and who is the one Lord,
        whose we are and whom we should continually serve, being under the
        greatest obligations to him, not only as our Creator, but as our head,
        husband, and Redeemer. Very rightly does the apostle premise fervency in
        spirit to serving the Lord; for without the Spirit of God there is no
        true worshipping and serving of him, and which ought to be done with
        fervency as well as with constancy. The Syriac version renders it,
        "serve our Lord".

      Rejoicing in hope,.... Of the glory of God, than the hope of which nothing
      can make a believer more cheerful in this world; the saints' joy is
      therefore called the "rejoicing of the hope",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#006">Heb 3:6</a>. This is placed
      between serving the Lord, and being patient in tribulation; for nothing
      tends more to animate the people of God to a cheerful serving of him, or
      to make them more patient under afflictions, than a hope of being for ever
      with the Lord:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        patient in tribulation; whilst the saints are in this world they must
        expect tribulation; their way to heaven lies through it; and it becomes
        them to be patient under it, not murmuring against God, on the one hand,
        nor reviling of men, on the other.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Continuing instant in prayer: prayer is needful at all times, but
        especially in a time of tribulation and distress, whether inward or
        outward. This should be made without ceasing; saints should watch unto
        it with all perseverance; men should pray always, and not faint; never
        give out and over, or be discouraged. This advice is rightly given and
        placed here, to teach us that we are to go to the throne of grace
        continually for fresh supplies of grace, and strength to enable us to
        exercise the grace, and perform the duties exhorted to both in preceding
        and following verses.

      Distributing to the necessity of saints,.... Or "communicating", as many
      versions render the word; "distributing" more properly belongs to the
      officers of the church, the deacons, and communicating to the members of
      it in common. All men in general are to be relieved that are in want, even
      our very enemies, and particularly such as are our own flesh and blood,
      nearly related to us, aged parents, &amp;c. and especially they that are
      of the household of faith, here called "saints"; and indeed, such only
      come under the care and notice of a church: and they are such, whom God
      has set apart for himself, has chosen in his Son, that they should be
      holy; whom Christ has sanctified, or whose sins he has expiated by his
      blood; and to whom he is made sanctification; and in whose hearts a work
      of grace and holiness is wrought by the Spirit of God, which is the
      sanctification of the Spirit they are chosen through, as a mean to eternal
      salvation by Christ; and in consequence of this, they live soberly,
      righteously, and godly, and have their conversations as become the Gospel
      of Christ: and such as these, being in necessitous circumstances, are to
      be communicated to; for not all, or any of the saints, but only such as
      are in "necessity", are here pointed at; it is not communicating to the
      saints, but to their necessity, which is recommended. It is the will and
      pleasure of God, that some of his dear children should be in strait
      circumstances of life, be reduced to want and distress, partly to try
      their own graces, their faith and trust in God, and dependence on him; and
      partly the graces of others, the charity, liberality, and beneficence of
      those who have of this world's goods: and who are the persons that are to
      "communicate", not words only, saying, be warmed and filled, and give
      nothing; but their substance, they are to deal their bread to the hungry,
      clothe the naked, and give a portion to as many as are in need: and these
      acts of giving and receiving, are one way by which the saints have
      communication with each other, and which is suggested by the word
      "communicating" here used; for fellowship does not lie merely in private
      conversation, and in sitting down together at the Lord's table, but in
      "communicating to one another such things" as are needful, as for the
      soul, so for the body. Some copies read, "communicating to the memories of
      the saints"; not making images of them, and praying to them, but speaking
      well and honourably of them, and imitating them in what they did well; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007">Pro 10:7</a>.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Given to hospitality; or, as it may be rendered, "pursuing", or
        "following after love to strangers"; which is properly hospitality:
        respect is to be shown not to such only who are members of the same
        community with us, but also to such of the people of God, that may be of
        another country, or of some distant parts of our own, not before known
        by us; who by persecution, and distress of some sort or another, or by
        some providence or another, are obliged to remove from their native
        place. These we are to love, and show our love to, not only by directing
        and advising, but, if need be, by giving them food and raiment, and
        lodging them: this is a duty incumbent on ministers of the Gospel, and
        on private members, and on all who are in any capacity to perform it;
        and which should be done cheerfully, and without grudging; and what
        persons should use, inure, and give themselves to, yea, should seek
        after, and call to objects of it; as Abraham and Lot did, who thereby
        entertained angels unawares, and is what the apostle here means by
        pursuing and following after it.

      Bless them which persecute you,.... It is the lot of God's, people in this
      world to be persecuted by the men of it, in some shape or another, either
      by words or deeds; either by reviling and reproaching them, and speaking
      all manner of evil of them; or by hindering them the free exercise of
      religious worship, by confiscation of their goods, imprisonment of their
      persons, by violently torturing their bodies, and taking away their lives;
      under all which circumstances they are taught to
      <p></p>
      <p>
        bless them; that is, to pray for them, that God would show them their
        evil, give repentance to them, and the remission of their sins; which is
        the order Christ gave to his disciples,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mat 5:44</a>; and encouraged
        to an observance of, by his own example,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034">Luk 23:34</a>; and has been
        followed herein by his disciples and apostles,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060">Act 7:60</a>
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012">Co1 4:12</a>. Moreover, by
        "blessing" may be meant, giving them good words, mild and soft answers,
        "not rendering evil for evil, railing for railing",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009">Pe1 3:9</a>; but, on the
        contrary, blessing, in imitation of Christ, who, "when he was reviled,
        reviled not again",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023">Pe1 2:23</a>, "bless",
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and curse not: to have a mouth full of cursing and bitterness,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#014">Rom 3:14</a>, is the character
        of an unregenerate man, and what by no means suits one who names the
        name of Christ; for blessing and cursing to proceed out of the same
        mouth, is as absurd and unnatural, as if it should be supposed that a
        fountain should send forth sweet water and bitter, or salt and fresh,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#010">Jam 3:10</a>. The imprecations
        upon wicked men, used by David and other good men, are no contradictions
        to this rule; since they were made under the inspiration of the Spirit
        of God, and were predictions of God's vengeance, which in righteous
        judgment should fall on them, and are not to be drawn into an example by
        us.

      Rejoice with them that do rejoice,.... Not in anything sinful and
      criminal, in a thing of nought, in men's own boastings; all such rejoicing
      is evil, and not to be joined in; but in things good and laudable, as in
      outward prosperity; and to rejoice with such, is a very difficult task;
      for unless persons have a near concern in the prosperity of others, they
      are very apt to envy it, or to murmur and repine, that they are not in
      equal, or superior circumstances; and also in things spiritual, with such
      who rejoice in the discoveries of God's love to their souls, in the views
      of interest in Christ, and of peace, pardon, and righteousness by him, and
      in hope of the glory of God; when such souls make their boast in the Lord,
      the humble hearing thereof will be glad, and will, as they ought to do,
      join with them in magnifying the Lord, and will exalt his name together:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and weep with them that weep; so Christ, as he rejoiced with them that
        rejoiced, at the marriage in Cana of Galilee, wept with them that wept,
        with Mary at the grave of Lazarus. The design of these rules is to
        excite and encourage sympathy in the saints with each other, in all
        conditions inward and outward, and with respect to things temporal and
        spiritual; in imitation of Christ their great high priest, who cannot
        but be touched with the infirmities of his people; and as founded upon,
        and arising from, their relation to each other, as members of the same
        body; see

      Be of the same mind one towards another,.... Which is not to be understood
      of the sameness of their judgment, or of their agreement in sentiments,
      espousing the same doctrines, observing the same ordinances, and in the
      same manner, and attending to the same form of discipline; but of their
      having the same love, and being of the same accord and affection to one
      another, entertaining the same good opinion, or a better, of others than
      of themselves; and so the Syriac version renders the passage, "what ye
      think of yourselves, think also of your brethren": think of one another,
      as equally interested in the love of God, redeemed by the blood of Christ,
      blessed with the same spiritual blessings in him, and called in the same
      hope of your calling; and do not think of one another, as being one richer
      or wiser than another, do not value yourselves upon that:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        mind not high things; be not highminded, do not think too highly of
        yourselves, and despise others; meddle not with, nor grasp at things too
        high for you, that are out of your reach, and beyond your capacity; nor
        seek great things for yourselves, as riches, honours, &amp;c. nor covet
        great company:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but condescend to men of low estate; or "to low things"; be content with
        mean and low things in life, and disdain not to take notice of and
        converse with, men in a low condition, whether in things temporal or
        spiritual; who may be poor in this world, be very ignorant and
        illiterate, as to general knowledge and learning; be men of mean parts
        and abilities, of very small gifts, and be weak in faith and experience;
        condescend to their weaknesses, bear their infirmities, and become all
        things to them for their good, and God's glory: consider the apostle is
        writing to citizens of Rome, who might be tempted to look upon
        themselves above others, and to look disdainfully upon others, as
        citizens too often do on country people, as if they were below them, as
        persons of low life to them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        be not wise in your own conceits; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#007">Pro 3:7</a>. This is attended
        with bad consequences, spoils a man's usefulness, prevents his
        improvement in knowledge, tempts him to reject all counsel and advice
        given him, and to treat his fellow creatures and Christians with
        haughtiness and insolence, and exposes him to the scorn and contempt of
        men: or "be not wise by or with yourselves"; imagining you have all the
        wisdom, and others have none; or keeping it to yourselves, what wisdom
        you have communicate it to others; the Ethiopic version reads, "say not,
        we are wise"; see

      Recompence to no man evil for evil,.... Neither evil words for evil words,
      railing for railing; nor evil deeds for evil deeds, one ill turn for
      another; nor the evil of punishment for the evil of fault, unless it be by
      persons, who under God have an authority to inflict it; as the civil
      magistrate, who "is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon
      him that doth evil",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#004">Rom 13:4</a>; but private
      revenge is what is here forbidden:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        providing things honest in the sight of all men. The Vulgate Latin
        reads, "not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men";
        and the Alexandrian copy reads, "in the sight of God and in the sight of
        men", which clause seems to have crept in here, out of
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#021">Co2 8:21</a>. The words are
        not to be understood of a man's providing things honest, decent, and
        commendable, as suitable food and raiment for his family, in the sight
        of all men, to the honour of religion, and the credit of his profession,
        which is right to be done; but of a provident, thoughtful, and studious
        concern, to do everything that is laudable and of good report among men.
        The Syriac version renders the words alter this manner, , "but be
        careful to do well", or exercise beneficence before all men; either
        restraining it to acts of beneficence, even to them that do us ill, in
        opposition to rendering evil to them; or applying it to all offices of
        humanity, and every good work, which are to be done in the sight of men;
        not merely to be seen of them, and in a vainglorious way, in order to
        obtain their esteem and applause, as did the Pharisees; but to avoid
        offence; to put, to silence, by well doing, the ignorance of wicked men;
        and to shame them that falsely accuse the good conversation of the
        saints; and to recommend the Gospel and true religion, and win men over
        to it thereby, and give an occasion to them of glorifying God.

      If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably,.... Or be at
      peace, seek after peace, pursue it, and cultivate it:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        with all men; with those that we are immediately concerned with, in a
        natural relation; so husbands should live peaceably with their wives,
        and wives with their husbands; parents with their children, and children
        with their parents; masters with their servants, and servants with their
        masters; and one brother, relation, and friend, with another: and so
        with all we are concerned with in a spiritual relation, as members of
        Christ, and in the same church state; such should be at peace among
        themselves,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#013">Th1 5:13</a>; peace should
        rule in their hearts,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#015">Col 3:15</a>, and they should
        study to keep "the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003">Eph 4:3</a>, yea, with all we
        are concerned in a civil sense; saints should live peaceably in the
        neighbourhood, towns, cities, and countries, where they dwell, and show
        themselves to be the quiet in the land; should pray for the peace of the
        place where they are; and do all that in them lies to promote it, by
        living themselves peaceably and quietly, in all godliness and honesty;
        yea, they should live peaceably with their very enemies, "if it be
        possible"; which is rightly put, for there are some persons of such
        tempers and dispositions, that it is impossible to live peaceably with;
        for when others are for peace, they are for war; and in some cases it is
        not only impracticable, but would be unlawful; as when it cannot be done
        consistent with holiness of life and conversation, with the edification
        of others, the truths of the Gospel, the interest of religion, and the
        glory of God; these are things that are never to be sacrificed for the
        sake of peace with men: the apostle adds another limitation of this
        rule, "as much as lieth in you"; for more than this is not required of
        us; nothing should be wanting on our parts; every step should be taken
        to cultivate and maintain peace; the blame should lie wholly on the
        other side; it becomes the saints to live peaceably themselves, if
        others will not with them.

      Dearly beloved,.... This affectionate appellation the apostle makes use
      of, expressing his great love to them, the rather to work upon then, and
      move them to an attention to what he is about to say; which they might
      assure themselves was in great tenderness to them, for their good, as well
      as the glory of God: moreover, he may hereby suggest to them, not only
      that they were dear to him, but that they were greatly beloved of God,
      that they were high in his favour and affection; and this he might him
      unto them, in order to melt them into love to their fellow Christians and
      fellow creatures, and even to their enemies, and never think of private
      revenge:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        avenge not yourselves; this is no ways contrary to that revenge, a
        believer has upon sin, and the actings of it, which follows on true
        evangelical repentance for it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#011">Co2 7:11</a>, and lies in a
        displicency at it, and himself for it, and in abstaining from it, and
        fighting against it; nor to that revenge a church may take of the
        disobedience of impenitent and incorrigible offenders, by laying
        censures on them, withdrawing from them, and rejecting them from their
        communion; nor to that revenge which civil magistrates may execute upon
        them that do evil; but this only forbids and condemns private revenge in
        private persons, for private injuries done, and affronts given:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but rather give place to wrath; either to a man's own wrath, stirred up
        by the provocations given him; let him not rush upon revenge
        immediately; let him sit down and breathe upon it; let him "give"
        "space", unto it, as the Syriac, which may signify time as well as
        place; and by taking time his wrath will, subside, he will cool and come
        to himself, and think better on it: or to the wrath of the injurious
        person, by declining him, as Jacob did Esau, till his wrath was over; or
        by patiently hearing without resistance the evil done, according to the
        advice of Christ,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039">Mat 5:39</a>; or to the wrath
        of God, leave all with him, and to the day of his wrath and righteous
        judgment, who will render to every man according to his works; commit
        yourselves to him that judgeth righteously, and never think of avenging
        your own wrongs; and this sense the following words incline to,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for it is written,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035">Deu 32:35</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord; vengeance belongs to
        God, and to him only; it is proper and peculiar to him, not to Heathen
        deities, one of which they call "vengeance"; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#004">Act 28:4</a>; nor to Satan,
        who is of a revengeful spirit, and is styled the enemy and the avenger;
        nor to men, unless to magistrates under God, who are revengers and
        executioners of his wrath on wicked men; otherwise it solely belongs to
        God the lawgiver, whose law is broken, and against whom sin is
        committed: and there is reason to believe he will "repay" it, from the
        holiness of his nature, the strictness of his justice, his power and
        faithfulness, his conduct towards his own people, even to his Son, as
        their surety; nor will he neglect, but in his own time will avenge his
        elect, which cry unto him day and night; and who therefore should never
        once think of avenging themselves, but leave it with their God, to whom
        it belongs.

      Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him,.... These words are taken from
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021">Pro 25:21</a>, and to be
      understood, as a Jewish (o) writer observes, according to "their literal
      sense"; though some of the Rabbins explain them in an allegorical way, of
      the corruption of nature. The Alexandrian copy and some others, and the
      Vulgate Latin version, reads "but if"; so far should the saints be from
      meditating revenge upon their enemies, that they should do good unto them,
      as Christ directs, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mat 5:44</a>,
      by feeding them when hungry, and giving drink unto them when thirsty:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        if he thirst give him drink; which includes all offices of humanity and
        beneficence to be performed unto them: the reason, or argument inducing
        hereunto is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head; not to do
        him hurt, not to aggravate his condemnation, as if this would be a means
        of bringing down the wrath of God the more fiercely on him, which is a
        sense given by some; as if this would be an inducement to the saints to
        do such acts of kindness; which is just the reverse of the spirit and
        temper of mind the apostle is here cultivating; but rather the sense is,
        that by so doing, his conscience would be stung with a sense of former
        injuries done to his benefactor, and he be filled with shame on account
        of them, and be brought to repentance for them, and to love the person
        he before hated, and be careful of doing him any wrong for the future;
        all which may be considered as a prevailing motive to God's people to
        act the generous part they are here moved to: in the passage referred
        to,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#021">Pro 25:21</a>, "bread" and
        "water" are mentioned as to be given, which include all the necessaries
        of life: and it is added for encouragement, "and the Lord shall reward
        thee". The sense given of this passage by some of the Jewish
        commentators on it agrees with what has been observed in some measure;
        says one (p) of them,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "when he remembers the food and drink thou hast given him, thou shall
        burn him, as if thou puttest coals upon his head to burn him, , and "he
        will take care of doing thee any ill";''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that is, for the time to come: and another of them observes (q) that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "this matter will be hard unto him, as if thou heapest coals on his head
        to burn him, , "because of the greatness of his shame", on account of
        the good that he shall receive from thee, for the evil which he hath
        rendered to thee.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This advice of showing kindness to enemies, and against private revenge,
        is very contrary to the dictates of human nature, as corrupted by sin.
        The former of these Julian the emperor represents (r) as a "paradox",
        though he owns it to be lawful, and a good action, to give clothes and
        food to enemies in war; and the latter, to revenge an injury, he says
        (s), is a law common to all men, Greeks and Barbarians; but the Gospel
        and the grace of God teach us another lesson.

      Be not overcome of evil,.... Neither of the evil one, Satan, who is very
      busy to stir up the corruption of nature to an hatred of enemies, and to
      seek revenge; but give no place nor heed unto him, resist him, and he will
      flee from you,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007">Jam 4:7</a>; "put on the whole
      armour of God", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#011">Eph 6:11</a>,
      whereby you may defend yourselves, that he cannot touch you: nor of the
      evil of sin that dwells in you; "for whom a man is overcome, of the same
      is he brought in bondage",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#019">Pe2 2:19</a>; nor of the evil of
      the man that has done you an injury, as you will be, if you return evil
      for evil, or take any steps and measures to avenge yourselves; for then
      not you, but he that has done you the wrong, will be the conqueror:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but overcome evil with good; overcome the evil man, and the evil he has
        done you, by doing good to him, by feeding him when hungry, by giving
        him drink when thirsty, by clothing him when naked, and by doing other
        offices of kindness and humanity to him; which is most likely to win
        upon him, and of an enemy to make him your friend: and if not, however
        it will show that you are conquerors, yea, "more than conquerors",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#037">Rom 8:37</a>, through the
        grace and strength of him that has loved you, over Satan, over the
        corruptions of your own hearts, and over the malice and wickedness of
        your enemies.
