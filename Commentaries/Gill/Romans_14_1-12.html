      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The apostle, having finished his exhortations to duties of a moral and
        civil kind, proceeds to the consideration of things indifferent, about
        eating some sorts of meats, and keeping days; to which he might be led
        by the last clause of the preceding chapter, lest that should be
        interpreted as referring to those who used their Christian liberty in
        eating every sort of food; in the use of which it was requisite to
        exercise that love which is the fulfilling of the law, he had so much
        pressed and recommended in the foregoing chapters. The church at Rome
        consisted both of Jews and Gentiles: and the former, though they
        believed in Christ, were not clear about the abrogation of the
        ceremonial law, and thought they ought still to observe the distinction
        of meats and days, which were made in it; the latter looked upon
        themselves under no manner of obligation to regard them; and even among
        thee Jews, some might have greater light and knowledge in these things
        than others, and used their Christian liberty, when others could not;
        and this occasioned great animosities and contentions among them; and
        some on account of these things were called strong, and others weak: and
        the chief view of the apostle in this chapter, is to give advice to each
        party how to behave one towards another; how the strong should behave to
        the weak, and the weak to the strong: and he begins with the strong, and
        in general exhorts them to a kind, tender, and affectionate regard to
        their weaker brethren, and not to perplex their minds with disputations
        about things to little profit,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001">Rom 14:1</a>, then a
        distribution of the members of this church into two parts is made,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#002">Rom 14:2</a>, showing the
        reason of the above exhortations; the one sort being strong believers,
        the others weak, the one eating all things, the other herbs; when some
        advice is given to each, that the strong should not despise the weak,
        nor the weak judge the strong; for which reasons are given: and the
        first is taken from the common interest they both have in the affection
        of God, and in divine adoption,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#003">Rom 14:3</a>, And another is
        taken from the relation which believers stand in to God, as servants;
        and therefore not to be judged and condemned, but to be left to their
        Lord and master, which is illustrated by a simile of such a relation
        among men, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#004">Rom 14:4</a>, and
        then another instance of different sentiments about Jewish rites and
        ceremonies is given,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005">Rom 14:5</a>, respecting the
        observation of days, in which also the members of the church were
        divided, some observing them, and some not; and the apostle's advice is,
        that every man should act as he was persuaded in his own mind, and not
        be uneasy with another: the reason for which he gives,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#006">Rom 14:6</a>, because the end
        proposed by the one, and the other, is the honour and glory of God, and
        which is the same in the man that eats, or does not eat meat, since both
        give thanks to God. And this is further confirmed from the general end
        of the Christian's life and death likewise, which is not to himself, but
        to the Lord, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007">Rom 14:7</a>,
        from whence it is concluded, that they are the Lord's in life and death,
        and all their actions are devoted to him; who by dying, rising, and
        living again, appears to be the Lord of quick and dead, and will judge
        both, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#009">Rom 14:9</a>, and
        therefore to his judgment things should be left, and one should not
        condemn or despise another, since all must stand at his bar,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010">Rom 14:10</a>, which is proved
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#011">Rom 14:11</a>, from a passage
        in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isa 45:23</a>, from all
        which it is concluded,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#012">Rom 14:12</a>, that an account
        must be given by everyone to God, at the general judgment; wherefore it
        is right and best, not to judge and condemn one another, but to judge
        this to be the most reasonable and agreeable to Christian charity, that
        care be taken not to offend, or cause a brother to stumble,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#013">Rom 14:13</a>, and whereas it
        might be objected, that nothing was impure in itself, and therefore
        might be lawfully eaten, which the apostle allows, and as for himself,
        was fully persuaded of, yet it was impure to them who thought it so,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#014">Rom 14:14</a>, and therefore
        should not eat; nor should others, when it gave offence to such persons;
        and which is dissuaded from, because to eat to the grief of the
        brethren, is contrary to Christian charity; and because it destroys the
        peace of such persons, and they are such whom Christ has died for,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015">Rom 14:15</a>, besides, hereby
        reproach might be brought upon them, the Gospel they professed, and the
        truth of Christian liberty they used,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#016">Rom 14:16</a>, and moreover,
        the kingdom of God did not lie in the use of these things, but in
        spiritual ones, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017">Rom 14:17</a>,
        and which should be chiefly regarded, since the service of God in them,
        is what is grateful to him, and approved by all good men,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#018">Rom 14:18</a>, wherefore the
        things which make for peace and edification should be followed after,
        things much preferable to meats and drinks,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019">Rom 14:19</a>, for the sake of
        which the peace of a brother, which is the work of God, should not be
        destroyed, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#020">Rom 14:20</a>, for
        though all things are pure in themselves, and lawful to be eaten, yet it
        is an evil to eat them to the offence of another, and for another to eat
        them against his conscience, which he may be drawn into by the example
        of others; wherefore it is best to abstain from eating flesh or drinking
        wine, and everything else that is stumbling and offensive to a weak
        brother, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#021">Rom 14:21</a>, and
        whereas the strong brother might object and say, I have faith in this
        matter, I believe it is lawful for me to eat anything, and why should I
        not? the apostle answers, by granting that he had faith, but then he
        observes, he ought to keep it to himself, and not disturb his weak
        brother, by putting it into practice openly; but should keep it to
        himself, it being his happiness not to condemn himself by using his
        liberty with offence,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#022">Rom 14:22</a>, and then some
        advice is given to the weak brother, not to eat with a doubting
        conscience, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023">Rom 14:23</a>,
        because in so doing, he would be self-condemned, and because it would
        not be of faith, and therefore sinful.

      Him that is weak in the faith,.... This address is made to the stronger
      and more knowing Christians among the Romans, how to behave towards those
      that were inferior in light and knowledge to them, with regard to things
      of a ritual and ceremonial kind: and by "him that is weak in the faith",
      is meant, either one that is weak in the exercise of the grace of faith,
      who has but a glimmering sight of Christ; who comes to him in a very
      feeble and trembling manner; who believes his ability to save him, but
      hesitates about his willingness; who casts himself with a peradventure on
      him; and who is attended with many misgivings of heart, faintings of
      spirit, and fluctuation of mind, about his interest in him: or one that is
      weak in the doctrine of faith; has but little light and knowledge in the
      truths of the Gospel; is a child in understanding; has more affection than
      judgment; very little able to distinguish truth from error; cannot digest
      the greater and more sublime doctrines of grace; stands in need of milk,
      and cannot bear strong meat; is very fluctuating and unsettled in his
      principles, and like children tossed to and fro with every wind of
      doctrine: or rather one that is weak in his knowledge of that branch of
      the doctrine of faith, which concerns Christian liberty; and that part of
      it particularly, which respects freedom from the ceremonial law: it
      designs one, and chiefly a Jew, who though a believer in Christ, and an
      embracer of the other truths of the Gospel, yet had but very little
      knowledge of Gospel liberty; but though that believers were to observe all
      the rituals of the Mosaic dispensation, not knowing that they were
      abolished by Christ. The phrase is Jewish; it is (m) said,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "what is the meaning of the phrase, in Rephidim,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001">Exo 17:1</a> it signifies such
        as are of weak hands; as if it had been said, because the Israelites
        were , "weak in their faith".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The advice the apostle gives, in reference to such a person, is to</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        receive him; not only into their affections, and love him equally, being
        a believer in Christ, as one of the same sentiments with them, only in
        this matter, but also into church fellowship with them. The Syriac
        version reads it, , "give him the hand": in token of communion, a form
        used in admission of members. The Gentiles were apt to boast against,
        and look with some contempt upon the Jews, and were ready to object to
        their communion, because of their want of light and knowledge in these
        matters; but this was no bar of communion, nor ought a person to be
        rejected on account of his weakness, either in the grace, or in the
        doctrine of faith, when it appears he has the true grace of God; and
        much less on account of his weakness in that branch of it, concerning
        Christian liberty; for since Christ does not break the bruised reed, nor
        quench the smoking flax, nor despise the day of small things, churches
        should not: it may also intend a receiving of such into intimate
        conversation, at their private meetings and conferences; taking
        particular notice of them; giving them proper instructions; praying with
        them and for them; endeavouring to build them up in their most holy
        faith, and to bring them into the knowledge of those things they are
        weak in; bearing their weaknesses patiently, and bearing with them in
        great tenderness: thus such should be received,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but not to doubtful disputations; to vain jangling and perverse
        disputings, such as will rather perplex than inform them; and will leave
        their minds doubtful and in suspense, and do them more harm than good.

      For one believeth that he may eat all things,.... He is fully persuaded in
      his mind, that there is nothing in itself common, or unclean; that the
      difference between clean and unclean meats, commanded to be observed by
      the law of Moses, is taken away; and that he may now lawfully eat any sort
      of food; every creature of God being good, and none to be refused, because
      of the ceremonial law which is abrogated, provided it, be received with
      thanksgiving, and used to the glory of God:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        another who is weak eateth herbs; meaning not one that is sickly and
        unhealthful, and of a weak constitution, and therefore eats herbs for
        health's sake; but one that is weak in the faith, and who thinks that
        the laws concerning the observance of meats and drinks are still in
        force; and therefore, rather than break any of them, and that he may be
        sure he does not, will eat nothing but herbs, which are not any of them
        forbidden by the law: and this he did, either as choosing rather to live
        altogether on herbs, than to eat anything which the law forbids; or
        being of opinion with the Essenes among the Jews, and the Pythagoreans
        among the Gentiles, who thought they were to abstain from eating of all
        sorts of animals.

      </p>
      Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not,.... Such who had a
      greater degree of Gospel light and knowledge, and made use of their
      Christian liberty in eating any sort of food, were not to despise as they
      were apt to do, such as abstained therefrom on account of the ceremonial
      law, as weak, ignorant; superstitious, and bigoted persons; or were not to
      set them at naught, or make nothing of them, as the word signifies, have
      no regard to their peace and comfort; but, on the other hand, were to
      consider them as brethren in Christ, though weak; and as having a work of
      God upon their souls, and therefore to be careful how they grieved them,
      destroyed their peace, or laid stumblingblocks in their way:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth: such who
        thought it not their duty to eat anything, but to forbear the use of
        some things directed to in the law, were not to censure and condemn, as
        they were apt to do, those who used their liberty in these things, as
        profane persons, and transgressors of the law of God; but leave them to
        the last and righteous judgment, when every one must be accountable to
        God for the various actions of life: the reason used to enforce this
        advice on both parties is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for God hath received him: which respects both him that eateth, and him
        that eateth not, him that is despised, and him that is judged; and is a
        reason why one should not despise, nor the other judge, because God had
        received both the one and the other into his heart's love and affection,
        into the covenant of grace, and into his family by adoption: they were
        received by Christ, coming to him as perishing sinners, according to the
        will of God; whose will it likewise was, that they should be received
        into church fellowship, as being no more strangers and foreigners, but
        fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and God
        had also received them into his service, and they were made willing to
        serve him, as well as to be saved by him; and did serve him acceptably
        with reverence and godly fear, in righteousness and holiness; and this
        is the rather to be taken into the sense of this passage, because of
        what follows.

      Who art thou that judgest another man's servant,.... This is another
      reason, dissuading from censoriousness and rash judgment, taken from civil
      things; one man has nothing to do with another man's servant; he has no
      power over him, nor any right to call him to an account for his actions;
      nor has he any business to censure or condemn him for them, or concern
      himself about them: so the believer supposed to be judged, does not belong
      to him that takes upon him to judge and condemn him; he is another's
      servant, he is the servant of God: he is chosen by God the Father for his
      service, as well as unto salvation; he is bought with the price of
      Christ's blood, and therefore not his own, nor another's, but Christ's, he
      is bought with his money; and he is also born in his house, the church;
      the Spirit of God in regeneration forms him for himself, for righteousness
      and holiness; under the influence of whose grace he voluntarily gives up
      himself to the service of God, and is assisted by him to keep his statutes
      and do them; and what has another to do with him? what power has he over
      him, or right to judge him?
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to his own master he standeth or falleth, the meaning of which is,
        either if he "stands", that is, if he serves his Lord and master, of
        which "standing" is expressive; and continues in the service of him,
        whose servant he professes to be; this is to his master's advantage and
        profit, and not to another's: and if he "falls", that is, from his
        obedience to him, as such who profess to be the servants of God may;
        they may fall off from the doctrine of grace they have embraced; and
        that either totally and finally, as such do who never felt the power of
        it in their hearts; or partially, from some degree of steadfastness in
        the faith: and such also may fall from a lively exercise of the graces
        of faith, hope, and love, and into great sins, which is to their
        master's dishonour, and cause his ways and truths to be evil spoken of;
        and so it is to their own master they fail: or else the sense is, to
        their own master they are accountable, whether they stand or fall, serve
        or disobey him; and it is according to his judgment and not another's,
        that they "stand", or are and will be justified and acquitted, and will
        hear, well done, good and faithful servant; and according to the same
        they will "fall", or be condemned, and hear, take the slothful and
        unprofitable servant, and cast him into outer darkness: so the words
        "standing" and "failing" are used by the Jews in a forensic sense, for
        carrying or losing a cause, for justification or condemnation in a court
        of judicature, and particularly in the last judgment: and so they
        explain <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#005">Psa 1:5</a>, "the
        ungodly shall not stand in the judgment": the Targum paraphrases it,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"the wicked shall not be justified in the great day;''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and Jarchi upon the place says, there shall be no , "standing of the
        foot" of the wicked, in the day of judgment; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#036">Luk 21:36</a>.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Yea, ye shall be holden up; which words seem to be a sort of correction
        of the apostle's, as if he should say, why do I talk of falling, one
        that is a true servant of the Lord's shall not fall, at least not
        totally and finally, nor in the last judgment; for he is holden by the
        right hand of God, by the right hand of his righteousness, and is kept
        by the power of God through faith unto salvation:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for God is able to make him stand; and will make him stand: words of
        power oftentimes include willingness as well as ability; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#024">Jdg 5:24</a>. God will make
        such to persevere to the end, because he has loved them with an
        everlasting love, chosen them in Christ, made a covenant with them in
        him, and has put them into his hands, and made them his care and charge;
        Christ has redeemed them by his blood, now intercedes, and is making
        preparations for them in heaven; they are united to him, and are built
        on him, the sure foundation; and the Spirit of God has begun that good
        work, which shall be performed. God will make such to stand in judgment
        with intrepidity, and without shame, being clothed with the
        righteousness of his Son; and shall therefore have the crown of
        righteousness given them, and an abundant entrance administered into his
        kingdom and glory: hence they ought not to be judged by man's judgment,
        nor need they regard it. The Alexandrian copy reads, "the Lord is able",

      One man esteemeth one day above another,.... This is another instance of
      the difference of sentiments in this church, about the observation of
      rituals; and is not to be understood of days appointed by the Christian
      churches for fasting, or abstinence from certain meats, either once a
      year, as the "Quadragesima", or Lent; or twice a week, as Wednesdays and
      Fridays; for these are things of much later observation, and which had
      never been introduced into the church of Rome in the apostle's time; nor
      were there any disputes about them: much less of days of Heathenish
      observation, as lucky or unlucky, or festivals in honour of their gods;
      for the apostle would never say, that a man who regarded such a day,
      regarded it to the Lord; nor would have advised to a coalition and
      Christian conversation with such a man, but rather to exclude him from all
      society and communion: it remains, therefore, that it must be understood
      of Jewish days, or of such as were appointed to be observed by the Jews
      under the former dispensation, and which some thought were still to be
      regarded; wherefore they esteemed some days in the year above others, as
      the days of unleavened bread, or the passover; particularly the first
      night, which was a night to be observed throughout their generations; and
      in their service for it to this day, use these words, , "how different is
      this night from every other night" (n)? and the feast of tabernacles,
      especially the last and great day of the feast, and the day of Pentecost;
      also one day in a month above others, the first day of the month, or new
      moon; and one day in a week, the seventh day sabbath: now there were some,
      who thought that the laws respecting these days were still in force,
      particularly the latter, and therefore esteemed it above another: but let
      it be observed, that the man that did so was one that was weak in faith;
      the same man that ate herbs, because he would not be guilty of violating
      those laws, which ordered a distinction of meats to be observed, the same
      weak man esteemed one day above another, imagining the laws concerning the
      distinction of days were still obligatory, not rightly understanding the
      doctrine of Christian liberty, or freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial
      law:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        another esteemeth every day alike; that is, one that is strong in faith,
        and has a greater degree of the knowledge of the Gospel, and of
        evangelical liberty, knows that the distinction of days, as well as of
        meats, is taken away, since the word was made flesh, and tabernacled
        among us, Christ the passover is sacrificed for us, the firstfruits of
        the Spirit have been received, and light by the church from the sun of
        righteousness, and Christ the true sabbath and rest is come; and
        therefore, being firmly persuaded there is no more holiness in days than
        there is in places, has the same regard for one day as another. The
        difference between these two lay here, the weak brother regarded a day
        for the sake of a day, as having by a positive law, he supposed to be in
        force, a superiority to another, and he regarded worship for the sake of
        this day; the stronger brother, though he also observed a day for divine
        worship, which is the Lord's day, since there must be some time for it
        as well as place, yet he observed the day for the sake of worship, and
        not worship for the sake of the day:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind; this is the advice the
        apostle gives to both parties; his sense is, that he would have each of
        them fully enjoy their own principle and practice undisturbed; he would
        have the weak brother, that esteemed one day above another, indulged in
        his way, since it arose from weakness, until he had better light, nor
        should he be despised for his weakness; he would have the stronger
        Christian also peaceably enjoy his sentiment, and pursue what he
        believed to be right; nor should he be judged, censured, and condemned,
        as a profane person, and a transgressor of the law: his counsel is, that
        they would sit down and carefully examine the word of God, and act
        according to the best light they should receive from thence; and take
        care especially, that they did not act contrary to their own
        consciences, with doubt and hesitation; they ought to be thoroughly
        satisfied in their own minds, and being so, should content themselves
        with their different sentiments and practices, without despising or
        censuring one another.

      He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord,.... The apostle
      strengthens the above advice with this reason, because what is done both
      by one and the other, is done unto the Lord. The weak brother that esteems
      one day above another, and regards the passover, pentecost, and feast of
      tabernacles, a new moon, or a seventh day sabbath, does it in obedience to
      the commands of the Lord, which he thinks are still binding, not knowing
      that they are disannulled by Christ; and the worship performed by him on
      any of those days is done in the name and strength of the Lord, with a
      view to his glory, and as believing it was pleasing in his sight; and
      whether he is right or wrong, it is to the Lord he does it, and to his own
      master he stands or falls. The following clause is omitted in the
      Alexandrian copy and some others, and in the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic
      versions, but is in most Greek copies, and retained in the Syriac and
      Arabic versions.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And he that regardeth not the day, the Lord he doth not regard it;
        believing it is the will of the Lord, that all distinction of days
        should cease; and that the law of commandments contained in ordinances,
        respecting such Jewish days, is abolished by the Lord Jesus Christ; and
        that it is to the honour the Lord not to observe them: for to regard the
        days of the feast of tabernacles, is tacitly to say, that the Word has
        not tabernacled among us; and to observe he days of the passover, is
        virtually to deny that our passover is sacrificed for us; and to keep
        the day of Pentecost, is all one as to affirm, that the firstfruits of
        the Spirit have not been given; and to regard a new moon, is in effect
        to say, that the church has not received evangelical light from Christ,
        the sun of righteousness; and to keep a seventh day sabbath, is a strong
        insinuation, as if Christ the true sabbath, in whom we have our
        spiritual and eternal rest, is not come; however, it is to the Lord that
        the stronger brother and more confirmed believer disregards any of those
        days; and it is to his own master he stands or falls, nor is he to be
        judged of man's judgment: and the same is the case of the eater, or
        non-eater of meats forbidden by the law:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks. The man
        that is strong in faith, and is fully persuaded by the Lord Jesus that
        all distinction of meats, as of days, is ceased, eats any thing, and
        every sort of food, that comes in his way, without making any
        difference; and when he eats or drinks at any time, it is all to the
        glory of God; which is a clear case, by his giving God thanks, as
        becomes him, for the food he eats: he acknowledges that these are the
        creatures of God, and his gifts to him; he gives him thanks for the
        right he has given him to eat of them, and for taking away the
        distinction of meats, and giving him the free use of his creatures; and
        the more thankful he is when he considers how unworthy he is of the
        least of these mercies: and
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth, or, and giveth God thanks.
        The man that is weak in faith, that eateth not food forbidden by the
        law, abstains from such food, purely on account of the Lord, in
        obedience to his will, and with a view to his glory, supposing such a
        law to be in full force; and is thankful to God for the herbs he allows
        him to eat, or for other food not forbidden by the law: and therefore
        since each party shows such a religious concern for the glory of the
        Lord, the apostle argues they ought to be easy one with another. The
        Alexandrian copy reads, "and giveth the Lord thanks".

      For none of us liveth to himself,.... That is, none of us believers;
      others may, but these do not, at least they ought not, nor do they when
      under the influence of the grace of God: they do not live, neither to
      righteous, nor to sinful self; they do not live upon their duties and
      services; nor do they ascribe their life, righteousness, and salvation to
      them; nor do they live to their own lusts, or make provision for the flesh
      to fulfil the lusts thereof, and much less to the lusts and wills of
      others:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and no man dieth to himself; every man dies, and must, or undergo a
        change equivalent to death; believers die as well as others, not
        eternally, or the second death, but corporeally, or a temporal death,
        but not to themselves; as they do not seek their own will and pleasure,
        and profit in life, so neither in death; they do not die to their own
        advantage only; death is gain unto them, it frees thema from all their
        sorrows, toil, and labours, and introduces them into the presence of
        Christ, and the enjoyment of everlasting happiness; but this is not all
        their death issues in, but also in the glory of Christ: moreover, no man
        has the power over life or death; as his life is not from himself, he
        has no power to lengthen or shorten it, nor to hinder or hasten death;
        this belongs to another Lord and master, whom life and death are both to
        subserve. This is an illustration of the above reason, by which the
        apostle confirms his advice.

      For whether we live, we live unto the Lord,.... As natural, so spiritual
      life is derived from the Lord, and believers live by faith upon him, and
      according to his will revealed in the word; find to his honour and glory;
      at least they desire so to do:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; resigning up life unto him,
        whenever it is his pleasure; magnifying of him, as by life, so by death;
        dying to be with him, to be raised again by him, and live with him for
        evermore; in the faith and hope of this, the believer both lives and
        dies, and so glorifies Christ both in life and death: hence this
        conclusion follows,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's; by the gift of the
        Father to him, by his own purchase, and the power of his grace, making
        them willing to give up themselves to him: and hence it is, that under a
        sense of this, that they are his, and not their own, nor another's, they
        do all they do for his glory; whether they observe, or not observe a
        day, it is to the Lord; whether they eat, or not eat things formerly
        forbidden, it is to him; and whether they live or die, it is to the
        Lord, whose they are: and hence also it is, that they are not to be
        despised and set at nought, or to be judged and censured by one another,
        since they belong to another master, who is their Lord, and will be
        their Judge.

      </p>
      For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived,.... This last
      word "revived" is omitted by the Vulgate Latin, but very naturally placed
      by the Syriac, between Christ's dying and rising. The Alexandrian copy
      reads, "died and lived": and the Ethiopic version, "died and revived": the
      end of all which was,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living; that is, of
        believers, whether dead or alive; for though he is Lord of all, as God
        and Creator, yet his appearing to be Lord by his dying, rising, and
        living again, can only have respect to them, for whom dying he has
        abolished death, and destroyed Satan; whom he has redeemed from sin, and
        delivered from this present evil world; and so having freed them from
        those other lords which had the dominion over them, shows himself to be
        their one and only Lord: and by rising again from the dead, ascending to
        heaven, and sitting at the right hand of God, all creatures and things
        being subject to him, he is made or declared both Lord and Christ; and
        living again, and continuing to live for ever, he appears to have the
        keys of hell and death; and will open the graves, and raise from thence,
        and judge both quick and dead, those that will be found alive at his
        coming, and such as he will cause to rise from the dead then; till which
        time, the apostle suggests, the decision of these differences about
        meats and days was to be left; and in the mean time the saints were to
        cultivate peace and love among themselves.

      But why dost thou judge thy brother?.... These words are spoken to the man
      weak in faith, that scrupled eating of certain meats, and chose rather eat
      none, and live on herbs, and who esteemed one day above another; and was
      very apt to censure and condemn such as made use of their Christian
      liberty in these things, though they were brethren, not in a natural or
      civil, but in a spiritual relation:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? these words, on the other
        hand, are directed to the stronger believer, who believed he might eat
        all things, and esteemed every day alike; being fully persuaded, that
        the distinction of meats and of days was now ceased; and such were apt
        to be puffed up with their superior knowledge and faith, and were ready
        to treat with an air of contempt those that were weak; showing little or
        no regard to their peace and edification, though they stood in the same
        relation to each other. The emphasis lies upon the word "brother", in
        both branches of the expostulation; and the force of the apostle's
        reasoning is that they should not judge or despise one another, because
        they were brethren, stood in the same relation to God and Christ,
        belonged to the same family, were partakers of the same grace, and had
        no pre-eminence one over another; they had but one master, and all they
        were brethren: and which he further enforces with the following reason
        or argument,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ; at the last
        day, when he shall sit on his throne of glory, and all nations shall be
        gathered before him, and he shall pronounce and execute the decisive
        sentence on each of them: there is a particular, and a general judgment;
        a particular judgment at death, when the soul is immediately consigned
        to bliss or woe; and a general one in the end of time; which may be
        proved both from reason, as from the relation creatures stand in to God,
        from the inequality of things in this life, and the conscious fears of
        men with respect to a future one; and from divine revelation, Christ
        will be the Judge, he is so appointed by his Father, and is every way
        fit for it, being God omniscient and omnipotent; and when he shall
        appear in his glory, he shall sit on his judgment seat, the dead will be
        raised, the books will be opened, and all shall be summoned to appear
        before him, of every age and sex, of every rank and degree, and of every
        character, good or bad: here the saints are particularly designed, "we
        shall all stand"; whether ministers or private Christians, weak or
        strong believers; they that are apt to judge, and others that are too
        ready to despise; they shall all stand before the tribunal of Christ,
        who is sole Judge, and shall render to every man according to his works,
        and from whom they shall all receive their sentence. The allusion is to
        human courts of judicature, in which the judge sits upon a bench, and
        they that are tried stand before him; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#010">Co2 5:10</a>. The Alexandrian

      For it is written,.... In
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023">Isa 45:23</a>; though Justin
      Martyr (o) cites a like passage with what follows, as out of Ezekiel 37,
      but no such words appear there, either in the Hebrew text, or Septuagint
      version:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as I live, saith the Lord; the form of an oath used often by the Lord;
        who because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself, by his
        own life; signifying, that what he was about to say, would as surely
        come to pass, as that he lived; and in the original text in Isaiah it
        is, "I have sworn by myself"; which being generally expressed, the
        apostle, perfectly agreeable to the meaning of it, gives the particular
        form of oath he swore, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#018">Isa 49:18</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        every knee shall bow to me; which is not to be understood literally of
        bowing of the knee at the name of Jesus, which has no foundation in
        this, nor in any other passage of Scripture, but figuratively, of the
        subjection of all creatures to Christ, both voluntary and involuntary.
        The Complutensian edition adds, "of things in heaven, and things in
        earth, and things under the earth", as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Phi 2:10</a>, from whence
        these words seem to be taken:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and every tongue shall confess to God; that is, everyone that has a
        tongue, every man, be he who he will, a good or a bad man, shall own at
        the last day, that Christ is God and Lord of all; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Phi 2:10</a>. It may be asked,
        how this passage appears to be a proof of what the apostle had asserted,
        for which purpose it seems to be cited, since here is nothing said of
        Christ, nor of his judgment seat, nor of all standing before it? to
        which may be returned, that it is clear from the context in the prophet,
        that the Messiah is the person speaking, who is said to be a just God
        and Saviour; and is represented as calling upon, and encouraging all
        sorts of persons to look to him for salvation; and as he in whom the
        church expected righteousness and strength, and in whom all the seed of
        Israel shall be justified, and shall glory; and which the Chaldee
        paraphrase all along interprets of , "the Word of the Lord"; the
        essential Word of God, the true Messiah: moreover, the bowing of the
        knee, and swearing, or confessing, to him, relate to his lordship and
        dominion over all; and suppose him as sitting on his throne of glory, as
        Lord of all, or as a judge on his judgment seat, in a court of
        judicature, where such like actions as here mentioned are performed; and
        whereas every knee is to bow, and every tongue to confess to him, which
        include all mankind, it follows then, that all the saints shall stand
        before him, bow unto him, own him as their Lord, and be judged by him.
        Kimchi says (p), that this shall be , "in the last days": and which the
        apostle rightly refers to the day of the general judgment. This place
        affords a considerable proof of Christ's true and proper deity, being in
        the prophet styled "Jehovah", and by the apostle "God"; and such things
        being ascribed to him, as swearing by himself, which no creature may do,
        and the subjection and confession of all creatures to him, whether they
        will or not.

      So then everyone of us,.... this is the conclusion, drawn from the
      foregoing account of things, that there will be a general judgment, that
      Christ will be Judge, and all must appear at his bar; from whence it
      necessarily follows, that every man, and so every Christian, strong or
      weak, whatever may be his gifts, talents, and abilities,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall give an account of himself to God; that is, to Christ, who is God;
        which is another proof of his deity, for he will be the Judge, the
        Father will judge no man; it is before his judgment seat all shall
        stand; and therefore the account must be given to him by every one, of
        himself, and not another; of all his thoughts, words, and deeds, which
        will be all brought into judgment; and of his time and talents, how they
        have been spent and used; and of all his gifts of nature, providence,
        and grace, how they have been exercised for the glory of God, his own
        good, and the good of others: the formal manner in which this will be
        done is unknown unto us; however, this is certain, that the saints will
        have upon this reckoning, in what sort soever it may be, a full and open
        discharge, through the blood and righteousness of Christ. The Jews (q),
        say, in much such language as the apostle does, that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "when a man removes out of this world, then "he gives an account to his
        Lord", of all that he has done in the world.''
