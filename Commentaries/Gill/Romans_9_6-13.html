      Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect,.... Or "it is not
      possible indeed that the word of God should fall"; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#010">Sa1 3:10</a>; This the apostle
      says, partly to relieve his own mind pressed with sorrow, and partly to
      obviate an objection some might make, or prevent any mistake any might be
      ready to go into; as though from what he suggested that what God had said
      concerning the people of the Jews, was made void and without effect: for
      whether by the "word of God" are meant, the Scriptures in general, the
      prophecies of the Old Testament, these were now about to have their
      accomplishment, in the rejection of the Jews, and in the conversion of the
      Gentiles; or whether by it is designed the Gospel, this, as preached both
      by Christ and his apostles, had had its effect upon God's chosen ones
      among that people; it was become the power of God unto salvation, to the
      Jew first: or rather by it may be intended, God's word of promise to
      Abraham, that he would be a God to him, and to his seed after him; and
      that he and they should be heir of the world, of this and of that which is
      to come; particularly the heavenly inheritance, which he gave to him by
      promise; this was not made void, or had taken none effect: for this was
      made only to Abraham and his spiritual seed; and therefore though his
      carnal seed believed not, and for their unbelief should be cut off, this
      did not make the faith, or faithfulness of God of none effect:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for they are not all Israel, which are of Israel; that is, they which
        are the descendants of the patriarch Jacob, whose name was Israel; or
        who are of the Israelitish nation, of the stock of Israel, belonging to
        that people; they are not all , "the Israel", by way of emphasis, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#022">Psa 25:22</a>, or the "Israel
        of God", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#016">Gal 6:16</a>, the
        Israel whom Jehovah the Father has chosen for a peculiar people; which
        Christ has redeemed from all their iniquities; which the Spirit of God
        calls with an holy calling, by special grace, to special privileges; the
        seed of Israel who are justified in Christ, whose iniquities are so
        pardoned and done away, that when they are sought for they shall not be
        found, and who are saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: or
        in other words, though they are "Israel after the flesh",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#018">Co1 10:18</a>, yet not after
        the Spirit; though they are by nation Israelites, they are not
        Israelites "indeed", as Nathanael was,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047">Joh 1:47</a>; they are Jews
        outwardly, not inwardly; they have not all principles of grace,
        uprightness, and sincerity in them: now to these spiritual Israelites,
        or seed of Abraham, were the word of God, the promises of God concerning
        spiritual and eternal things made, and upon these they had their effect;
        and therefore it could not be said that the word of God had taken none
        effect; though the whole body of Israel after the flesh were cut off and
        rejected. Some copies, and the Vulgate Latin version, read, "who are
        Israelites"; and the Ethiopic version, "they are not all Israel who came
        out of Egypt".

      Neither because they are the seed of Abraham,.... The Jews highly valued
      themselves, upon being the natural seed of Abraham; and fancied, upon this
      account, that they were children, which the apostle here denies: neither
      <p></p>
      <p>
        are they all children; as in the former verse, he explains in what sense
        they were Israelites, which he had mentioned among their high characters
        and privileges, as descending from Jacob, and in what sense they were
        not; so in this he shows in what manner the "adoption",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004">Rom 9:4</a>, belonged to them,
        and it did not; being Abraham's seed, they were his natural children,
        and the children of God by national adoption; but, they were not all the
        spiritual children of Abraham, nor the children of God by the special
        grace of adoption; these characters only belonged to some of them, and
        which are equally true of Gentile believers; who being of the same faith
        with Abraham, are his children, his seed, and also the children of God:
        natural descent from Abraham avails nothing in this case, as is clear
        from the instance of Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was the natural seed of
        Abraham, as well as Isaac; but he was not a son of Abraham in a
        spiritual sense, nor a child of God; he was not a child of promise, this
        was peculiar to Isaac:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but in Isaac shall thy seed be called; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Gen 21:12</a>. The meaning of
        which is, either that the progeny of Abraham in the line of Isaac should
        only be called, accounted, and esteemed, in an eminent sense, the seed
        of Abraham, and not his posterity in the line of Ishmael: agreeably to
        which the Jews say (c), that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Ishmael is not , "in the general account of the seed of Abraham"; for
        it is said, "in Isaac shall thy seed be called",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012">Gen 21:12</a>; nor is Esau in
        the general account of the seed of Isaac; hence, says R. Joden bar
        Shalom, in Isaac, that is, in part of Isaac.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        So another (d) of their writers, on mentioning this passage, observes,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"that it is said in Isaac, , but "not all Isaac";''</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or all that sprung from him. Or this has respect to the most eminent and
        famous seed of Abraham, the Messiah, in whom all nations of the earth
        were to be blessed; who was to spring from him by Isaac, in the line of
        Jacob; and may likewise have a personal respect to Isaac himself, the
        son of the promise, a child of Abraham in a spiritual sense, when
        Ishmael was not; and to whom belonged the spiritual promises and
        blessings, and who was to be, and was effectually called by the grace of
        God; and may include also his whole seed and posterity, who, both
        natural and spiritual, were children of the typical promise, the land of
        Canaan, and the enjoyment of temporal good things; and the matter also
        children of the antitypical promise, or of those spiritual and eternal
        things, which God has promised to Abraham's spiritual seed, whether
        among Jews or Gentiles; and which always have their effect, and had,
        even when, and though Abraham's natural seed had a "lo ammi",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009">Hos 1:9</a>, written upon
        them.

      </p>
      That is, they which are the children of the flesh,.... This is an
      explanation of the foregoing verse, and shows, that by "the seed of"
      Abraham are meant, the natural seed of Abraham, who are born after the
      flesh, or descend from him by carnal generation:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        these are not the children of God; that is, not all of them, nor any of
        them, on account of their being children of the flesh, or Abraham's
        natural seed; for adoption does not come this way; men do not commence
        children of God by their fleshly descent; they are not "born of blood",
        but of God, who are the sons of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but the children of the promise are counted for the seed; "children of
        the covenant", is a common phrase with the Jews; who reckoned themselves
        as such, because they were the seed of Abraham: thus in their prayers
        they say (e) to God,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "we are thy people, , "the children of thy covenant", the children of
        Abraham thy friend.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And so they were the children of the covenant, or promise, which God
        made with Abraham and his natural seed, respecting the land of Canaan,
        and their enjoyment of temporal good things in it; but they were not all
        of them the children of the promise, which God made to Abraham and his
        spiritual seed, whether Jews or Gentiles, respecting spiritual and
        eternal things; to whom alone the promises of God, being their God in a
        spiritual sense, of spiritual and eternal salvation by Christ, and of
        the grace of the Spirit of God, and of eternal life belong; and who are
        the seed which were promised to Abraham by God, saying, "thou shalt be a
        father of many nations",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#004">Gen 17:4</a>, for which
        reasons, because these spiritual promises belong to them, and because
        they themselves were promised to Abraham, as his children, therefore
        they are called "children of the promise": or rather, because as Isaac
        was a child of promise, being born after the Spirit, by virtue of the
        promise of God, through his divine power and goodness, when there were
        no ground or foundation in nature, for Abraham and Sarah to hope for a
        son; so these are called "children of promise",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028">Gal 4:28</a>, because they are
        born again, not through the power of nature, and strength of their own
        free will; they are not born of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
        of man, but of God, according to the will of God and his abundant mercy,
        by the word of truth, through his power, Spirit, and grace; and by faith
        receive the promises made unto them; and are counted and reckoned as
        "Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#029">Gal 3:29</a>, whether they be
        Jews, or whether they be Gentiles: and since now the promises of God are
        all made good to these persons, the word of God is not without effect,
        or is not made void, by the casting off the children of the flesh, or
        the carnal seed of Abraham, who were not children of the promise in the
        sense now given.

      </p>
      For this is the word of promise,.... The following passage is the
      Scripture, which contains the promise concerning the birth of Isaac; which
      was the produce, not of nature, but of divine grace and power; and was
      typical of the regeneration of God's elect, who "as Isaac was, are the
      children of promise",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#028">Gal 4:28</a>, for as Ishmael was
      a type of them that are born after the flesh, and are carnal men, so Isaac
      was a type of those, who are born after the Spirit, and are spiritual men:
      the promise is,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        at this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son; the passage
        referred to is in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010">Gen 18:10</a>; which there
        stands thus, "I will certainly return unto thee, according to the time
        of life, and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son": some difference there
        is between the words as cited by the apostle, and as they stand in the
        original text; the word "lo", is omitted by the apostle, nor was there
        any necessity to repeat it, since it was used only to excite Abraham's
        faith, attention, and wonder; also the phrase "thy wife", is neglected,
        the reason is, because the words in Genesis are an address to Abraham,
        here the substance of the promise to him is produced; besides it was not
        only well known in the apostle's time, that Sarah was the wife of
        Abraham, but that as such she brought forth Isaac, wherefore it was not
        so very necessary it should be mentioned here; add to this, that it is
        not repeated in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014">Gen 18:14</a>,
        which will justify our apostle in the omission of it: but the greater
        seeming difference is, that what in Genesis is rendered, "according to
        the time of life", is by the apostle, "at this time": some think, that
        there may be an emendation of the present original text, and suppose a
        various reading, and that the apostle, instead of "life", read "this",
        but there is no occasion for such a supposition, or to make this
        amendment: for the phrase "the time of life", signifies the present
        time, the "nunc stans"; so R. Levi ben Gerson (f), understands this
        phrase, "according to the time of life", , "according to this time which
        is now standing and abiding" and adds, rightly is this said, because
        neither time past nor to come are to be found, only the present time,
        the "nunc stans" and afterwards more than once explains it, of this
        present time, the next year: and so both R. Solomon Jarchi, and R. Aben
        Ezra (g), expound it, , "according to this time", the year following;
        that is, exactly according to this present time next year, or this time
        twelve month; besides, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#021">Gen 17:21</a> it is said, "at
        this set time", and in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#014">Gen 18:14</a>, "at the
        appointed time"; all which support the apostle in his version.

      </p>
      And not only this,.... This instance of Ishmael and Isaac, is not the only
      one, proving that Abraham's natural seed, the children of the flesh, are
      not all children, the children of God:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac,
        "it was said unto her",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012">Rom 9:12</a>, being in a
        parenthesis, "the elder shall serve the younger". The apostle was aware,
        that the Jews would be ready to say, that the instance of Ishmael and
        Isaac was not a pertinent one; since Ishmael was not born of Sarah, the
        lawful wife of Abraham, but of a bondwoman, which was the reason his
        rejection, when Isaac was the son of promise, by the lawful wife, and
        that they were children of Abraham in the line of Isaac, and so children
        of the promise, as he was: wherefore he proceeds to mention the case of
        Jacob and Esau, which was not liable to any such exception; seeing they
        not only had the same father, but the same mother, Isaac's lawful wife;
        they were conceived by Rebecca at once, were in the same womb together,
        were twins, and if any had the preference and advantage, Esau had it,
        being born first; and yet a difference was made between these two by God
        himself, and which was notified by him to the mother of them, before
        either were born.
      </p>

          ></span
        >
      </p>
      For the children being not yet born, So says (h) the Chaldee paraphrast,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "the prophet said unto them, was it not said of Jacob, , "when he was
        not yet born", that he should be greater than his brother?''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the Syriac version supplies, "his children", that is, Isaac's; and the
        Arabic version, "his two children". This shows, that the apostle designs
        not the posterity, but the very persons of Jacob and Esau; since as he
        speaks of their conception in the verse preceding, so of their birth in
        this: and though in the words of God to Rebecca, and which are urged in
        favour of the other sense, it is said, "two nations are in thy womb, and
        two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one
        people shall be stronger than the other people",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023">Gen 25:23</a>; yet this
        primarily respects the persons of Jacob and Esau, as the roots of their
        respective offspring; and only secondarily their posterity, as branches
        that should sprout from them; it properly regards their persons, and
        only in an improper, figurative, and metonymical sense, their seed; for
        in no other sense could two nations, or two manner of people be in
        Rebecca's womb, than as there were two persons there, who would be the
        authors of two nations and people; and whatever may be said for their
        respective posterity, taking their rise from one common father Isaac, or
        for their being chosen or rejected as nations, before they were in being
        as such, yet it cannot be said with any propriety, that "Rebecca
        conceived" their several offspring "by one, even by our father Isaac",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#010">Rom 9:10</a>, which sense well
        agrees with the scope of the apostle, which is to prove, that all were
        not Israel which were of Israel, and that all Abraham's natural seed
        were not the children of God; which he could not better exemplify, than
        in the persons of Jacob and Esau; for to have instanced in the posterity
        of Esau, would have been foreign to his purpose, and not accord with the
        continuation of his discourse in the following verses, which entirely
        proceeds upon the subject of personal election and rejection, and with
        the scriptural account of the personal characters of Jacob and Esau; and
        from hence, as from many other passages, it may be concluded, that
        predestination, whether to life or death, is a personal thing, concerns
        particular persons, and not nations, or collective bodies of men:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        neither having done any good or evil; Jacob and Esau were under all
        considerations upon an equal foot, were just in the same situation and
        condition, when the one was loved and the other hated; or in other
        words, when the one was chosen, and the other rejected; they were
        neither of them as yet born, and had they been born, their birth and
        parentage could have been no reason why one was chose and the other not,
        because in both the same; nor had the one performed a good action, or
        the other an evil one; so that Jacob was not loved for his good works,
        nor Esau hated for his evil ones; which confirms the truth of this
        doctrine, that the objects of predestination, whether to life or death,
        are alike, are in the same situation and condition: whether they are
        considered in the corrupt mass, or as fallen, they are all equally such,
        so that there could not be any reason in them, why some should be chosen
        and others left; or whether in the pure mass, antecedent to the fall,
        and without any consideration of it, which is clearly signified in this
        passage, there could be nothing in the one, which was not in the other,
        that could be the cause of such a difference made: so that it follows,
        that works neither good nor evil are the causes moving God to
        predestinate, whether to life or death; good works are not the cause of
        election to eternal life, for not only, this act of distinguishing
        grace, passed before any were done, but also these are fruits, effects,
        and consequence of it, and so cannot be the causes thereof; God does not
        proceed in order branches of salvation, as in calling, justification,
        &amp;c. according to them, and therefore it cannot be thought he should
        proceed upon this foot in the first step to it; and which is ascribed to
        his free grace, in opposition to works. Evil works are not the cause of
        the decree of rejection, for this also being as early as the decree of
        election, as it must unavoidably be, was before any evil works were
        done; sin is not the cause of God's decree, but of the thing decreed,
        eternal death; otherwise all the individuals in the world being equally
        in sin, must have been rejected: it remains then, that not any works of
        men, good or bad, are the cause of predestination in either of its
        branches, but the sovereign will and secret counsel of God: that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the purpose of God according to election might stand: the decree of God,
        which is entirely free, and depends upon his own will and choice, stands
        firm and immutable, and is not to be disannulled by earth or hell, for
        it stands not on the precarious foot of works:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not of works: did it, it would not stand sure, for nothing is more
        variable and uncertain, than the actions of men:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but of him that calleth: who is the unchangeable Jehovah; it stands upon
        his invariable will and immutable grace, whose "gifts and calling are
        without repentance",

      It was said unto her,.... To Rebecca,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023">Gen 25:23</a>,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the elder shall serve the younger, or "the greater shall serve the
        lesser", an Hebrew way of speaking; so Japheth is called "the great",
        or, as we render it, "the elder",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#021">Gen 10:21</a>; and the evil
        imagination is said (i) to be "greater", that is, elder than the good,
        thirteen years; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#026">Luk 22:26</a>; The sense is,
        Esau shall be a servant to Jacob; which is to be understood, not of
        temporal servitude; for in this sense he never was a servant to him; so
        far from it, that as soon as Jacob had got the birthright and blessing,
        he was obliged to flee from the face and fury of Esau; and upon his
        return after many years, he sent messengers to Esau in a very submissive
        manner, charging them after this manner, "thus shall ye shall say to my
        lord Esau, thy servant Jacob saith thus", &amp;c.
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#004">Gen 32:4</a>, and when he
        found that his brother was coming to meet him, which threw him into a
        panic fear, lest he should "smite him, and the mother with the
        children", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#011">Gen 32:11</a>, he
        prepares presents for him; and when he came to him, bowed himself seven
        times, and his wives and children bowed likewise; and the language in
        which he addressed his brother Esau, all the while they were together,
        was that of "my lord": now if this oracle was to be understood of
        outward temporal servitude, it is strange it should have no appearance,
        nor any shadow of an accomplishment in the persons of Jacob and Esau,
        supposing it was to have one in their posterity; and indeed the
        completion of it, in this sense, is not very evident in their offspring.
        It is certain, there was a long train of dukes and kings in Esau's
        family, before there was any king in Israel; the posterity of Esau were
        in lordly grandeur and splendour, when the children of Israel were
        grievously oppressed with hard bondage in Egypt. The single instance
        usually referred to, when the Edomites became tributaries to David, was
        near a thousand years after the giving out of this oracle; and this show
        of servitude did not last long, for in Joram's time they revolted, and
        so continued; and it is evident, that at the time of the Babylonish
        captivity, the children of Edom were prosperous and triumphant, and said
        concerning Jerusalem, "Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation
        thereof", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007">Psa 137:7</a>, this
        servitude therefore is to be understood in a spiritual sense, of Esau's
        exclusion from the favour of God, and blessings of grace, signified by
        his being rejected from inheriting the blessing, which was given to
        Jacob; and it appeared that he was not a son, but a servant, by his
        departure, and pitching his dwelling elsewhere; which showed he had no
        interest in spiritual adoption, no right to the covenant of grace, nor
        was he an heir of heaven, all which were peculiar to Jacob: Esau was a
        servant of sin, under the dominion of it, and in bondage to it; whilst
        Jacob was the Lord's freeman, and, as a prince, had power with God and
        with men, and prevailed: Esau was serviceable to Jacob, both in things
        temporal and spiritual; as reprobates are to the elect, for all things
        are for their sakes, and work together for their good; Jacob's being
        obliged to flee from his brother, was for his good; by this means he got
        him a suitable wife, and large substance: his brother's meeting him on
        his return, which gave him so much pain and uneasiness, issued in his
        spiritual good; this sent him to the throne of grace, to humble himself
        before God, acknowledge his mercies, and his dependence on him, to
        implore his help, and plead his promises; and thus the oracle was
        verified in the persons of Jacob and Esau.

        Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. These words are explanative
        of the former; they are of like import, and the one interpret the other;
        and show, that the former are to be understood in a spiritual, and not
        in a temporal sense, and of the persons, and not the posterity of Jacob
        and Esau; for though Malachi prophesied long after Jacob and Esau were
        personally dead, yet the Lord in that prophecy manifestly directs the
        murmuring Jews to the personal regard he had had to Jacob and Esau, and
        which had continued in numberless instances to their respective
        posterities, in order to stop their mouths, and reprove their
        ingratitude; and though he speaks of the nation of the Edomites, and to
        the posterity of Israel, yet it is evident, that he has a respect to the
        persons of Jacob and Esau, from whence they sprung, when he says, "was
        not Esau Jacob's brother?"
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002">Mal 1:2</a>, now though an
        Edomite may be said to be brother to an Israelite, yet Esau is never
        said, nor can he with any propriety be said to be the brother of Jacob's
        posterity: it remains, that these words regard their persons, and
        express the true spring and source of the choice of the one, and the
        rejection of the other; and which holds true of all the instances of
        either kind: everlasting and unchangeable love is the true cause and
        spring of the choice of particular persons to eternal salvation; and
        hatred is the cause of rejection, by which is meant not positive hatred,
        which can only have for its object sin and sinners, or persons so
        considered; but negative hatred, which is God's will, not to give
        eternal life to some persons; and shows itself by a neglect of them,
        taking no notice of them, passing them by, when he chose others; so the
        word "hate" is used for neglect, taking no notice, where positive hatred
        cannot be thought to take place, in
