      For I would not, brethren,.... The apostle in order to raise the attention
      of the Gentiles to what he was about to deliver to them, not only styles
      them "brethren", expressing his affection for them, and their relation to
      him and other believing Jews, and to one another, being all one in Christ
      Jesus, partakers of the same grace, and heirs of the same glory; but also
      tells them, that what he had to acquaint them with was a "mystery", a
      thing secret and hidden, which had not been heard of and known, at least
      not so fully and clearly as he was about to reveal it; and because of his
      great respect for them, he was unwilling, as he says,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that ye should be ignorant of this mystery; he was desirous that they
        should abound and improve in all spiritual knowledge and judgment, and,
        among the rest, be better informed of this particular article, the call
        of the Jews: and his view in apprizing them of it is expressed in the
        following clause,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        lest ye should be wise in your own conceits: lest they should imagine
        that they were the only wise and knowing persons, and be elated in their
        minds with their knowledge and understanding, and look with contempt
        upon the poor, blind, ignorant Jews, as if they were always to remain in
        such a state of darkness and infidelity. The thing he had to inform them
        of is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the
        Gentiles be come in; by Israel is meant the Jews, the descendants of
        Jacob, whose name was Israel. Philo the Jew observes (b), that this name
        signifies , "the vision of God"; indeed, Jacob had it given him when he
        wrestled with the angel, and saw God face to face, though it does not
        seem to be for that reason; however, blindness had now befallen the
        Jews, who had been favoured with a divine revelation, with the knowledge
        of God, his will and worship; and none were more blind than those who
        were called the servants and messengers of the Lord of hosts, as the
        Scribes and Pharisees, the priests and princes of the Jewish world. This
        "blindness" designs their unbelief, the hardness of their hearts, and
        darkness of their understandings with respect to God himself, whom they
        knew not in Christ; not as the Father of Christ; nor even the
        perfections of his nature, particularly his righteousness; which was the
        reason of their setting up their own righteousness, and of their
        non-submission to the righteousness of Christ: they were blind as to the
        Messiah; they knew him not, when he came; they saw no beauty and
        comeliness in him; could not discern the characters of him in Jesus,
        though they were so manifest; and rejected him notwithstanding the clear
        evidence of his ministry and miracles. They were in the dark about the
        sense of the prophecies of the Old Testament; a vail was upon their
        hearts when they read them, so that they understood them not, and could
        not see their accomplishment in Christ; they were even ignorant of the
        law, the spiritual nature, true use, and right end and scope of it; and
        it is no wonder that the Gospel should be hidden from them. This
        blindness "happened" to them not by chance, but befell them by the
        decree, and according to the will of God, who hardens whom he pleases;
        and according to various predictions in the Old Testament, cited in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014">Mat 13:14</a>; and in
        righteous judgment, for since they liked not to retain God and his
        Christ in their knowledge, it was but just in God to give them up to
        reprobate minds, to judicial blindness, and hardness of heart: but then
        this blindness only happened to them "in part"; not that it was only in
        some measure or some degree, for it was total, they were darkness
        itself, and had no spiritual and evangelic light at all on whom it fell;
        but that this blindness was not general with respect to persons, there
        were some few, a seed, a remnant, that were delivered from it, though
        the far greater part of the nation were involved in it, and continue in
        it to this day; and will do, "until the fulness of the Gentiles be come
        in": that is, till the whole number of God's elect among them, be called
        and brought into the Gospel church state, which in the latter day will
        be very great; when the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the
        Lord, as the waters cover the sea; when the kingdoms of this world shall
        become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ; and the abundance of the
        sea shall be converted, and the forces of the Gentiles shall come to the
        church, and multitudes of them shall flock thither, as doves to their
        windows: and since the blindness of the Jews is not yet removed, it
        seems plain that the full number of God's chosen ones among the Gentiles
        is not yet completed in regeneration; for as soon as ever they are all
        called and brought in, the vail will be taken away from the Jews, and
        they will be turned unto the Lord.

      And so all Israel shall be saved,.... Meaning not the mystical spiritual
      Israel of God, consisting both of Jews and Gentiles, who shall appear to
      be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation, when all God's elect
      among the latter are gathered in, which is the sense many give into; but
      the people of the Jews, the generality of them, the body of that nation,
      called "the fulness" of them,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Rom 11:12</a>, and relates to
      the latter day, when a nation of them shall be born again at once; when,
      their number being as the sand of the sea, they shall come up out of the
      lands where they are dispersed, and appoint them one head, Christ, and
      great shall be the day of Jezreel; when they as a body, even the far
      greater part of them that shall be in being, shall return and seek the
      Lord their God, and David their King; shall acknowledge Jesus to be the
      true Messiah, and shall look to him, believe on him, and be saved by him
      from wrath to come. There is a common saying among them (c), , "all Israel
      shall have a part", or "portion in the world to come"; and in support of
      this they usually produce the passage in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021">Isa 60:21</a>, "thy people also
      shall be all righteous": yea, they even go so far as to say (d),
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that hell fire will have no power over the transgressors of Israel;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        fancying, that every individual person of their nation will be saved;
        though they sometimes except such who deny the resurrection of the dead,
        and that the law is from heaven, or is an epicure, and he that reads
        foreign books, or is an enchanter, or pronounces the ineffable name: but
        the apostle is not to be understood with such a latitude; he refers to
        the last times, and to a very general conversion of them to the Messiah:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as it is written,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020">Isa 59:20</a>,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        there shall come out of Zion the Deliverer: the words of the prophet
        are, "and the Redeemer shall come to Zion": by the Redeemer, or
        Deliverer, words of the same signification, is meant the Messiah, as the
        Jews (e) themselves own, and apply this passage to him; who is the
        "Goel", or near kinsman of his people, to whom the right of their
        redemption belongs as man; and who as God was able to effect it, and, as
        God-man and Mediator, was every way qualified for it, and has obtained
        it for them: and whereas, in the prophet Isaiah, he is said to "come
        to", and by the apostle, "out of Zion", this may be reconciled by
        observing, that the servile letter sometimes signifies "from", as well
        as to, when it is put in the room of of which instances may be given, as
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#001">Exo 16:1</a> compared with
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#004">Ch2 11:4</a>. Besides, the
        Messiah was to come out of Zion, as well as to come to it, according to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#007">Psa 14:7</a>; so that the
        apostle fitly expresses the faith and expectation of the old Jewish
        church in this citation:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob; in the prophet it is, "and
        unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#020">Isa 59:20</a>. The apostle
        follows the translation of the Septuagint, and which is favoured by the
        Chaldee paraphrase, which runs thus; "the Redeemer shall come to Zion,
        and to turn the rebellious ones of the house of Jacob to the law"; so
        that the Jew (f) has no reason to charge the apostle with a perversion
        of the prophet's words, when they are cited so agreeably to their own
        Targumist: and the sense of them relates not to what Christ did on the
        cross, when the iniquities of his people were laid on him, and he bore
        them, and removed them all in one day from them; but to what he will do
        to the Jews in the latter day, in consequence thereof; he will convince
        them of their ungodliness, give them repentance for it and remission of
        it.

      For this is my covenant unto them,.... This is what God has promised to
      them in covenant, and he will be as good as his word; his covenant will
      never be broken, it will always remain sure and inviolable; so that there
      is not only a possibility, and a probability, but even a certainty, of the
      call and conversion of the Jews; which promise and covenant will have
      their accomplishment,
      <p></p>
      <p>when I, saith the Lord,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall take away their sins: some think that the apostle alludes to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034">Jer 31:34</a>; others, that he
        takes this passage out of
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa027.htm#009">Isa 27:9</a>; where in the
        Septuagint version the selfsame phrase is used; though it may be no
        citation, or reference, but the apostle's own words, explaining what is
        meant by "turning away ungodliness from Jacob",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026">Rom 11:26</a>; and as before;
        regards not the taking away of their sins by the sacrifice of Christ,
        which is done already, and is what the blood of bulls and goats could
        not do; but of the removing of their sins from themselves, from their
        consciences, by the application of the blood of Christ, and the
        imputation of his righteousness.

      </p>
      As concerning the Gospel,.... Whereas it might be objected to the call and
      conversion of the Jews, their implacable enmity to the Gospel, the apostle
      replies, by granting, that with respect to that,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        they were enemies to God and Christ, to the Gospel, and the ministers of
        it, and particularly to the apostle:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for your sakes; the Gentiles, to whom it was preached, and by whom it
        was received, and which greatly irritated and provoked the Jews; or the
        sense is, that they were suffered to reject the Gospel, and treat it
        with hatred and virulence, that by this means it might be taken away
        from them, and carried to the Gentiles; so that the present enmity of
        the Jews to the Gospel, turned to the advantage of the Gentiles, and
        should not hinder the future conversion of God's elect among them in the
        latter day:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes;
        as many of them as belong to the election of grace, are beloved of God;
        and will appear to be so, when they are called by grace, as they will
        be, for the confirming of the promises concerning their future
        restoration made unto their fathers; not one of which shall ever fall to
        the ground, or they be deprived of any gifts and blessings of grace,
        which God has purposed for them, or promised to them, as is clear from
        what follows:
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029">Romans 11:29</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="margnote"
          ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"
            ><a name="an_029">rom 11:29</a></font
          ></span
        >
      </p>
      For the gifts and calling of God,.... By "gifts" are meant, not the gifts
      of nature and providence, as life, health, strength, riches, and honour,
      which God sometimes gives, and repents of, and takes away; as he repented
      that he had made man upon earth, and Saul king of Israel; which must be
      understood by an "anthropopathy", after the manner of men, and that not of
      a change of the counsel of his mind, but of the course of his providence:
      nor do gifts here design external gifts of grace, or such gifts of the
      Spirit, which qualify men for ministerial work, for public service in the
      church; for these may be taken away, as the "parable" of the "talents"
      shows,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#029">Mat 25:29</a>; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#008">Co1 13:8</a>; but the special
      and spiritual gifts of God's free grace, which relate to the spiritual and
      eternal welfare of the souls of men, even that, grace which was given to
      God's elect in Christ before the world was, and all those spiritual
      blessings wherewith they were then blessed in him: these
      <p></p>
      <p>
        are without repentance; that is, they are immutable and unalterable; God
        never revokes them, or calls them in again, or takes them away from the
        persons to whom he has made such a previous donation: the reasons are,
        because that his love from whence they spring is always the same; it
        admits of no distinction, nor of any degrees, nor of any alteration; and
        electing grace, according to which these gifts are bestowed, stands sure
        and immovable; not upon the foot of works, but of the sovereign will of
        God, and always has its sure and certain effect; and the covenant of
        grace, in which they are secured, remains firm and inviolable; and
        indeed, these gifts are no other than the promises of it, which are all
        yea and amen in Christ, and the blessings of it, which are the sure
        mercies of David. Whatever God purposes, or promises to give, or really
        does give to his people, whether into the hands of Christ for them, or
        into their own, he never repents of or reverses. Agreeably to these
        words of the apostle, the Jews say (g).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that the holy blessed God, after , "that he hath given a gift", ,
        "never takes it away from the receiver"; and this is the "Gemara", or
        doctrine of the Rabbins (h) , "that giving they give, but taking away
        they do not take away"; the gloss upon it is, , "after it is given":''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the meaning is, that what is once given to men from heaven, is never
        taken away from them up into heaven: and elsewhere (i) they ask,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "is there any servant to whom his master gives a gift, and returns and
        takes it away from him?''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the apostle here says the same of the "calling of God", as of
        gifts; by which is meant, not a bare external call by the ministry of
        the word, which oftentimes is without effect, and may be where persons
        are neither chosen, nor converted, nor saved; but an internal effectual
        call, by special, powerful, and efficacious grace; and designs either
        actual calling, to which are inseparably annexed final perseverance in
        grace, and eternal glorification; or rather the purpose of God from
        eternity, to call his people in time, and which is never repented of, or
        changed. The apostle's argument here is this, that since there are a
        number of people among the Jews whom God has loved, and has chosen to
        everlasting salvation, and has in covenant promised to them, and secured
        and laid up gifts for them, and has determined to call them by his
        grace; and since all these are unchangeable and irreversible, the future
        call and conversion of these persons must be sure and certain.

      For as ye in times past have not believed God,.... The times referred to,
      are the times of ignorance, idolatry, and superstition; when God suffered
      the Gentiles, for many hundreds of years, to walk in their own ways; while
      the Jews were his favourite people, were chosen by him above all people,
      separated from them, and distinguished by his goodness; had his word and
      oracles, his judgments and his statutes to direct them, and many other
      valuable blessings: the times before the coming of the Messiah are here
      meant, when these people sat in darkness, and in the region of the shadow
      of death; till Christ, who came to lighten the Gentiles, sent his Gospel
      among them, and which has been attended with great success; in these times
      they were in a state of incredulity: they either, as some of them, did not
      believe there was a God, or that there was but one God, at least but very
      few believed it; and these did not know who he was; nor did they glorify
      him as God, or perform any true spiritual worship to him: the far greater
      part believed there were more gods, and did service to them which by
      nature were no gods, and fell down to idols of gold, and silver, and wood,
      and stone:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; that is, they
        were regenerated, effectually called and converted, through the rich and
        abundant mercy of God; repentance unto life was granted to them; and
        faith in our Lord Jesus, as a free grace gift, was bestowed upon them;
        and they had an application of pardoning grace and mercy, through the
        blood of Christ, made unto them; and all this through the unbelief of
        the Jews: not that their unbelief could be the cause of their obtaining
        mercy; but the Jews not believing in the Messiah, but rejecting him, and
        contradicting and blaspheming his Gospel, it was taken away from them,
        and carried to the Gentiles; which was the means of their believing in
        Christ, and obtaining mercy; so that the unbelief of the Jews was the
        occasion and means, in Providence, of bringing the Gospel to the
        Gentiles, whereby faith came; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011">Rom 11:11</a>. This mercy they
        are said to enjoy "now"; for the present time of the Gospel is the
        dispensation of mercy to the Gentiles.

      Even so have these also now not believed,.... Now is the time of the Jews'
      unbelief, blindness has happened to them, the vail is over their hearts;
      as the Gentiles formerly did not believe God, so the Jews do not now;
      though they believe there is a God, and that there is but one God, yet
      they do not believe God in Christ; nor that he is the Father of Christ; or
      that Christ is the Son of God, the true Messiah, and Saviour of the world:
      they do not believe, as some read the words, connecting them with the next
      clause, and so they stand in the original text, "in your mercy"; meaning
      either Christ, in whom the Gentiles obtained mercy; or the Gospel, the
      means of it; or the sense is, that they do not believe that mercy belongs
      to the Gentiles, having entertained a notion, treat the Messiah, and the
      blessings of mercy and goodness by him, are peculiar to Israel: but our
      version after Beza, who follows Theophylact, connects the clause with the
      following,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that through your mercy they may obtain mercy; not through the mercy the
        Gentiles show to others, but which they have received of God; and
        principally intends faith, which springs from the mercy of God, and is a
        gift of his pure, free, rich grace; and stands opposed to the unbelief
        of the Jews, through which the Gentiles are said to obtain mercy; and
        the meaning: is, that in time to come, the Jews, observing the mercy
        obtained and enjoyed by the Gentiles, will be provoked to jealousy, and
        stirred up to an emulation of them, to seek for the same mercy at the
        same hands, and in the same way, they have had it; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#011">Rom 11:11</a>; The apostle's
        argument in favour of the call and conversion of the Jews, upon the
        whole is this, that since the unbelief of the Gentiles was no bar to
        their obtaining mercy, and that through the infidelity of the Jews; then
        it cannot be thought, that the present blindness, hardness of heart,
        enmity, and unbelief, which now attend the Jews, can be any obstacle to
        their obtaining mercy in the same way the Gentiles have; but as the one
        has been, the other also will be.

      For God hath concluded them all in unbelief,.... Both Jews and Gentiles,
      particularly God's elect among them: some think the metaphor is taken from
      the binding up of sheaves in bands; and that Jews and Gentiles are the
      sheaves, and unbelief the band, in which they are bound together; but the
      apostle is not speaking of their being together in unbelief, but as
      separate, first the Gentiles, and now the Jews: rather it seems to be
      taken from a prison, and Jews and Gentiles are represented as prisoners,
      and unbelief the prison, in which they are shut up by God: not that God is
      the author of unbelief, or of any other sin in men; he does not put it
      into them, or them into that, but finding them in unbelief, concludes them
      in it, or leaves them in such a state, and does not as yet however deliver
      out of it, or say to the prisoners, go forth: moreover, to be "concluded
      in unbelief", is the same as to be "concluded under sin",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022">Gal 3:22</a>; that is, to be
      thoroughly convinced of it; and to be held and bound down by such a sense
      of it in the conscience, as to see no way to escape deserved punishment,
      or to obtain salvation, but by fleeing to the mercy of God in Christ:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that he might have mercy upon all: not upon all the individuals of Jews
        and Gentiles; for all are not concluded in, or convinced of the sin of
        unbelief, but only such who are eventually believers, as appears from
        the parallel text,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#022">Gal 3:22</a>; and designs all
        God's elect among the Jews, called "their fulness",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Rom 11:12</a>; and all God's
        elect among the Gentiles, called "the fulness of the Gentiles",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025">Rom 11:25</a>; for whom he has
        mercy in store, and will bestow it on them; and in order to bring them
        to a sense of their need of it, and that he may the more illustriously
        display the riches of it, he leaves them for a while in a state of
        unbelief, and then by his Spirit thoroughly convinces them of it, and
        gives them faith to look to, and believe in, the mercy of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, unto eternal life.

      O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God,....
      These words are the epilogue, or conclusion of the doctrinal part of this
      epistle, and relate to what is said throughout the whole of it hitherto;
      particularly to the doctrines of salvation by Christ, justification by his
      righteousness, predestination, the calling of the Gentiles, the rejection
      of the Jews, and their restoration in the latter day; upon the whole of
      which, the apostle breaks forth into this pathetic exclamation; the design
      of which is to show, how much of the wisdom and knowledge of God is
      displayed in these doctrines, and how small a part of it is known by the
      best of men, and therefore ought not to be cavilled at and objected to,
      because of some difficulties attending them, but to be received upon the
      testimony of divine revelation: and if there was a depth in these things
      unsearchable and past finding out by so great a man as the apostle, who
      had by revelation such knowledge in the mysteries of grace, and who had
      been caught up into the third heaven, and heard things unutterable, how
      much less is it to be fathomed by others, and therefore should be silent:
      by "the wisdom and knowledge of God", one and the same thing is meant; and
      design not so much the perfections of the divine nature, which are
      infinite and unsearchable, the understanding of which is too high for
      creatures, and not be attained to by them; nor the display of them in the
      works of creation and providence, in which there are most glorious and
      amazing instances; but rather the effects of them, the counsels and
      decrees of God; which are so wisely formed and laid, as not to fail of
      their accomplishment, or to be frustrated of their end; and the doctrines
      of grace relating to them, in which are treasures, riches, that is, an
      abundance of wisdom and knowledge; and a depth, not to be reached to the
      bottom of, in this imperfect state, and in which the knowledge and wisdom
      of God are wonderfully displayed: thus in the doctrine of redemption and
      salvation by Christ, wherein God has abounded in all wisdom and prudence;
      in the person fixed upon to be the Saviour, his own Son; who by the
      assumption of human nature, being God and man in one person, was very fit
      and proper to be a Mediator between God and man, to transact the affair of
      salvation; was every way qualified for it, and able to do it: so likewise
      in the manner in which it is accomplished, being done in a way which
      glorifies all the divine perfections; in which the rights of God's justice
      and the honour of his holiness are secured, as well as his love, grace,
      and mercy, displayed; in which Satan is most mortified, sin condemned, and
      the sinner saved; and also in the persons, the subjects of it, ungodly
      sinners, enemies, the chief of sinners, whereby the grace of God is the
      more illustrated, and all boasting in the creature excluded. The wisdom of
      God manifestly appears, in the doctrine of a sinner's justification; which
      though it proceeds from grace, yet upon the foot of redemption and
      satisfaction, in a way of strict justice; so that God is just, whilst he
      is the justifier; it is of persons ungodly, and without a righteousness in
      themselves, and yet by a perfect and complete righteousness, answerable to
      all the demands of law and justice; and the grace of faith is wisely made
      the recipient of this blessing, that it might appear to be of free grace,
      and not of works, and that the justified ones might have solid peace, joy,
      and comfort, from it. The doctrine of predestination is full of the wisdom
      and knowledge of God; his choice of some to everlasting life in his Son,
      through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, for the
      glorifying of his grace and mercy, in a way of righteousness; and his
      passing by others, leaving them to themselves, and in their sins, justly
      to perish for them, for the glorifying of his justice, are acts of the
      highest wisdom, and done according to the counsel of his will. The account
      just given of the call of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews, is
      an astonishing scheme of infinite wisdom; that, on the one hand salvation
      should come to the Gentiles, through the fall of the Jews, and they should
      obtain mercy through their unbelief; and on the other hand that the
      restoration of the Jews should be as life from the dead to the Gentiles;
      and the Jews, through their mercy, obtain mercy; and that both, in their
      turns, should be shut up in unbelief by God, that he might have mercy on
      them all, "O the depth", &amp;c. To which is added,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        how unsearchable are his judgments! which are not to be understood of
        his awful judgments on wicked men in particular, nor of the
        administrations of his providence in general; though these are a great
        deep, and in many instances are unsearchable, and cannot be counted for
        in the present state, but will hereafter be made manifest; nor of the
        commands of God, sometimes called his judgments, which are all plain,
        and may be easily searched out in his word; but rather of the counsels
        and purposes of God, and the doctrines of grace relating thereunto;
        which are the deep things of God, and are only searched out by the
        Spirit of God, who reveals them to us:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and his ways past finding out! not the methods and course of his
        providence, though his way in this respect is often in the deep, his
        footsteps are not to be known, discerned, and traced, by finite
        creatures; but rather the goings forth and steps of his wisdom from
        everlasting, in his purposes and decrees, council and covenant, which
        are higher than the ways of men, even as the heavens are higher than the
        earth; and which are all mercy and truth to his chosen people, and
        strict justice to others, and not to be found out by any; particularly
        his ways and methods, and dealings, with both Jews and Gentiles; that he
        should for so many hundred years leave the Gentiles in blindness and
        unbelief; and now for as many years his favourite people the Jews in the
        same, and yet gather in his elect out of them both; these are things out
        of our reach and comprehension.

      For who hath known the mind of the Lord,.... The intentions of his mind,
      the thoughts of his heart, and the counsels of his will: these could never
      have been known, if he had not revealed them; nor can the doctrines
      relating to them, though externally revealed, be known by the natural man,
      or by the mere dint of nature, but only by the light of the Spirit of God;
      who searches them, and makes them known in a spiritual manner to spiritual
      men, who have a spiritual discerning of them; and yet even by these they
      are not known perfectly, only in part, and are seen through a glass
      darkly:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or who hath been his counsellor? or was of his council, when all things
        were fixed according to his sovereign will: when the scheme of man's
        salvation was consulted and agreed upon between the eternal Three, there
        was no creature, angel, or man there; no created angel, only the eternal
        One, "the Counsellor",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</a>; or as the
        Septuagint there style him, , "the angel of the great council"; none but
        Father, Son, and Spirit, were present, when the book of life was made,
        when the names of God's elect were put into it, and others left out;
        when all things relating to his chosen ones, both for time and eternity,
        whether among Jews or Gentiles, were determined, ordered, and settled;
        and as there was no creature that assisted, or could give any advice
        about these matters, so there were none that were privy to the
        resolutions, determinations, and counsels of his will; which were
        purposed in himself and in his Son, and were known only to them and his
        Spirit, which is in him: from the whole it appears, that predestination
        is not according to men's works, or the foresight of them; for then
        these things would be plain and easy, they would not be unsearchable and
        past finding out; there would not be an unfathomable depth in them; the
        mind and counsels of God, and the springs of them, would be obvious; but
        it is according to his secret, sovereign, and unchangeable will.

      Or who hath first given to him,.... See
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job041.htm#011">Job 41:11</a>; no man can give
      God anything, which he has not first given him, or which he has not a
      prior right to, or a claim upon him for; Adam, in innocence, was not able
      to give God anything, nor are the angels in heaven, much less sinful men
      on earth; their bodies and souls, and all their enjoyments, all that is
      good in them, or done by them, are from the Lord; men by all their good
      works, best duties and services, give nothing to God, nor lay him under
      any manner of obligation to them: hence no man can merit anything at the
      hands of God, if he could,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it shall be recompensed to him again; but it is impossible there should
        be merit in a creature, who has nothing but what he has from God, and
        does nothing but what he is obliged to do; and that not by his own
        strength, but by the grace and strength of God; and therefore there is
        no retribution made by God as of debt, but of grace: hence it follows,
        that God is indebted to, and obliged by none, and may do what he will
        with his own; love Jacob and hate Esau; choose one and not another;
        reject the Jews, and call the Gentiles; save and justify some, and not
        others; none can call him to account, or say unto him, what dost thou?

      For of him, and through him, and to him are all things,.... Not only all
      things in nature and providence, he being the Maker and efficient cause of
      things, and the preserver and supporter of them their beings, and to whose
      glory they are all designed and directed; but all things in grace owe
      their original to him, as their first cause; they are produced by him, and
      make for his glory; they all spring from his sovereign will, are brought
      about by his almighty power, and tend to the glory of his grace; as does
      every thing in election, redemption, and regeneration: particularly the
      counsels and purposes of God respecting men may be here meant; which all
      rise out of his own heart, without any motive or inducement to them in the
      creature; are accomplished by his divine power, notwithstanding all the
      opposition of men and devils; and all issue in his glory, even such of
      them as may seem to carry in them severity to some of his creatures: and
