      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        "the blessed God , "hath not cast away the men of the captivity", though
        they are under the chastisements of God; but it is fit that they should
        every day obtain salvation by the hands of Messiah, the Son of David.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Now to this objection the apostle makes answer; "first", in his usual
        way,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God forbid, when anything was objected which was displeasing to him,
        abhorred by him, which was not agreeable to the perfections of God, to
        the truth of his word, and promises, and could by no means be admitted
        of; and next by observing his own case, which was a standing instance to
        the contrary; for God had chosen him unto eternal salvation, Christ had
        redeemed him by his blood, and he was effectually called by grace; and
        as to his eternal state, he had no doubt or scruple about it; and
        besides, the Lord had made him a minister of the Gospel, had greatly
        qualified him for that work, had raised him to the high office of an
        apostle, and had made him very useful to the souls of many, both Jews
        and Gentiles; and yet he was one of the nation of the Jews, and
        therefore God had not cast them all away, as the objection insinuates:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for I also am an Israelite; according to the flesh, by lineal descent
        from Jacob or Israel; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#022">Co2 11:22</a>; as well as in a
        spiritual sense:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        of the seed of Abraham; "the grandfather of Israel"; the head of the
        Jewish nation he was, both of his natural and of his spiritual seed, who
        is the father of us all:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        of the tribe of Benjamin; a very little tribe, which in the time of the
        Judges was near being destroyed, and, upon the return from the captivity
        of Babylon, was very small, as it was at this time; and yet God had not
        cast away this, much less all the tribes of Israel.

      </p>
      God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew,.... The apostle goes
      on with his answer to the objection, by distinguishing and explaining who
      he meant by the people God had not cast away, namely, which were
      "foreknown" by him; for all mankind are in a sense his people, being made,
      maintained, and supported in their beings by him, yet they are not all
      foreknown; for were they, they would be all predestinated, called,
      conformed to the image of Christ, justified and glorified; but some of
      them will be cast away, being bad and wicked, and will be sent into
      everlasting punishment: and though the people of the Jews in general were
      the people of God, being in a sense chose, known, and distinguished by him
      from the rest of the world, yet they were not all a "foreknown" people, in
      the sense the apostle uses the word; wherefore a great number of them were
      cast away, of which afterwards the apostle speaks largely in this chapter:
      but then there were a people among them, that were the people of God in a
      more special sense; they were chosen by him from everlasting to be his
      people; they were taken into the covenant of his grace as such; they were
      given to Christ as his people, and were redeemed and saved by him on that
      account; and were, or were to be called, with an holy calling, when they
      are openly declared to be the people of God, whom he foreknew: he not
      merely knew them before, by his general prescience and foreknowledge,
      which extends to all persons and things; or foresaw their faith, holiness,
      and good works, and so chose them for himself; for faith, holiness, and
      good works, are fruits and effects of electing grace; but he so knew them
      before, even from all eternity, as that he approved of them, liked them,
      loved them, and took delight and complacency in them: now these his people
      he never did, nor never will cast away. Their numbers may be but very
      small in some periods of time, yet none of them are cast away; God may not
      immediately arise to their help and assistance in time of distress, or so
      soon as they desire and expect; he may withdraw his presence, hide
      himself, and stand at a distance from them; he may afflict them in a
      fatherly way, when they may think he has cast them off, or cast them away;
      whereas he never casts any of them away, nor out of his heart's love, nor
      out of his sight, nor out of the covenant of his grace, nor out of the
      hands of his Son, nor out of his family, or so as that any of them shall
      perish eternally; so far from it, that he takes the utmost delight in
      them, grants them the greatest nearness to himself, bears the strongest
      affection for them, and takes the most diligent care of them; whoever
      casts them out of their affection and company, he will not; the reasons
      are, because his love to them is unchangeable, his purpose concerning
      their salvation stands firm and sure, his word and oath are unalterable,
      his gifts and calling are without repentance; and they are his jewels,
      portion, and inheritance; they are as the apple of his eye, and
      continually held by his right hand. The apostle next replies to this
      objection, by putting them in mind of the case and state of the church of
      God, in the times of Elijah; and what judgment that prophet formed of it,
      and in which he appeared to be mistaken:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        wot ye not what the Scripture saith of Elias? do ye not know? ye cannot
        be ignorant who have, and read the Scripture, what it says of Elias, or
        "in Elias"; that is, as the Arabic version renders it, "in the history
        of Elias"; in the account it gives of his life and times:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying: that is, how
        he spoke to God in prayer concerning Israel; and instead of praying for
        them, as the prophets were wont to do, he was obliged to bring a
        complaint against them for their idolatry, contempt of the worship of
        God, and violent persecution of his true followers. The apostle chose to
        mention this instance because there was some likeness between his case
        and Elijah's; and the state of the people of Israel at the then present
        time, and as in the times of Elijah; for as the Jews in his time killed
        and persecuted the prophets of the Lord, so in the present time they had
        killed the Lord Jesus Christ, and persecuted his apostles; and as
        Elijah, though one of their own prophets, was obliged to make
        intercession against them, so the apostle, though one of their own
        countrymen, could not but speak against them, and of their just
        rejection by God: and this he observes, to soften their resentments
        against him, when so great a prophet had done so before him: and this
        the Jews themselves own (p), for they say that Elijah , "brought an
        accusation against Israel": and it is observed by another (q) that
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "coals are said of Isaiah and Elijah, because they delivered an
        accusation against Israel: one called them a people of unclean lips, and
        the other said, for they have forsaken thy covenant:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>which is the apostle's sense.</p>

      Lord, they have killed thy prophets,.... By the order of Jezebel, wife of
      Ahab king of Israel,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004">Kg1 18:4</a>. This sin of
      slaying the prophets of the Lord is charged upon the Jews by Christ (Mat 23:31) and by the
      apostle, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#015">Th1 2:15</a>. In the
      text in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014">Kg1 19:14</a>, it is
      added, "with the sword": which expresses the manner of death they were put
      to; and this clause is there put after the following, according to a rule
      of transposition among the Jews; See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#010">Mat 27:10</a>.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And digged down thine altars; either the altars which the patriarchs had
        formerly built, and were still in being; and though not used, yet were
        kept and had in great veneration; wherefore the pulling of them down was
        done in contempt of them, and of the worship of God, which had been
        formerly performed there; or else such altars, which the religious among
        the ten tribes built, since the times of Jeroboam, who forbad them to go
        up to Jerusalem, but ordered them to go to Dan or Bethel; which they not
        choosing to do erected altars in different places for divine service,
        and which the Jews (r) say were allowed; for from that time, the
        prohibition of altars at other places than at Jerusalem ceased:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and I am left alone: meaning either as a prophet, not knowing that
        Obadiah had hid an hundred prophets by fifty in a cave,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#004">Kg1 18:4</a>; or else as a
        worshipper of the true God, imagining that he was the only person in
        Israel, that had a true zeal for the Lord of hosts:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and they seek my life; lay in wait for it, Jezebel by her emissaries
        being in quest of him; it is added in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#014">Kg1 19:14</a>, "to take it
        away"; for she had swore by her gods, that by the morrow about that
        time, his life should be as the life of one of the prophets of Baal he
        had slain; and in one copy it is added here.

      But what saith the answer of God unto him?.... The divine response, or
      oracle, the , "Bath Kol", or voice from heaven; the still small voice of
      the Lord, which Elijah heard (Kg1 19:12)
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I have reserved to myself; for his worship and service, to be partakers
        of his grace, inheritors of his kingdom, to show forth his praise, and
        for his name's sake, for his honour and glory: these he reserved in
        eternal election, in the council and covenant of peace; separated them
        in time from others by his grace, and preserved them from the general
        defection and apostasy: even
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        seven thousand men: meaning either that precise and exact number, which
        was but small in comparison of the very large multitude of persons that
        were in the ten tribes, or else a certain number for an uncertain:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>who have not bowed the knee; a sign of reverence and adoration:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to the image of Baal; Jezebel's god, the god of the Zidonians; a name
        common to many of the "deities" of the Gentiles, and signifies "lord",
        or "master"; we read of "Baalim" in the plural number, for there were
        "lords many" of this name: in the Greek text the article is of the
        feminine gender, wherefore our translators have supplied the word image.
        This word has, in the Septuagint version, sometimes a feminine article
        as here; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#003">Kg2 21:3</a>; but in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018">Kg1 19:18</a>, from whence
        this passage is taken, the article is masculine, as it is also in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg002.htm#011">Jdg 2:11</a>, and in other
        places. This deity being either of both sexes, or of no distinguished
        sex; or it may be, the reason it has so often a feminine article is,
        because it was a young heifer, or in the form of one; so in the history
        of Tobias 1:5, it is said, that "all the tribes which apostatized
        together sacrificed", , "to Baal the heifer". The apostle's view in
        mentioning this instance is to show, that when the church and cause of
        God are at the lowest, God has always some true worshippers of him; and
        that he never casts away his foreknown people, whose numbers are
        generally more than they are thought to be by the saints themselves;
        good men, as Elijah, may be mistaken in this matter; all which he
        accommodates to the then present state of God's people, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005">Rom 11:5</a>.

      </p>
      Even so then at this present time also,.... In which the apostle lived,
      the time of preaching the Gospel, the accepted time, the day of salvation,
      which then was, and also now is; at that time when the Gospel was sent
      unto the Gentiles, and God took out of them a people for his name; when
      multitudes of them were converted, and embraced the faith of Christ; and
      when the Jews in general had rejected the Messiah, killed the Lord Jesus,
      persecuted his apostles, and contradicted and blasphemed the Gospel; yet
      still God had made a reserve of some among them, for himself:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        there is a remnant; alluding either to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021">Isa 10:21</a>, or to the
        oracle delivered to Elijah, saying, "I have reserved", or "left",
        &amp;c. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#018">Kg1 19:18</a>, that as
        God had reserved for himself, in Elijah's time, a number of persons, who
        had not gone into the idolatrous worship of Baal, when the greater part
        of the Israelites did, so he had taken care to make a like reserve in
        the apostle's time, when the bulk of the Jewish nation had refused the
        Messiah, and despised his Gospel. This is a further proof, that God had
        not cast away all the people of the Jews; and that as Elijah was not the
        only worshipper of the true God in his time, so the apostle was not the
        only instance of grace among that people now; there was a number of
        them; the number of the disciples after our Lord's ascension, was an
        hundred and twenty; upon the first sermon preached by Peter, three
        thousand were converted, and added to them; after that, they are said to
        be about five thousand, and still multitudes were added, both of men and
        women, and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith; so
        that before the dispersion of the church at Jerusalem by a persecution,
        there might be at least such a number called by grace, as God had
        reserved in Elijah's time; though these, when compared with the
        generality of the nation, which remained in unbelief, were but a few,
        and therefore called a "remnant", or a "reserve", as the word may be
        rendered; for these were a set of men, whom God had reserved and
        preserved in his Son, and in the covenant of his grace, from
        everlasting; and had kept a watchful eye over them in time, reserved
        them in his providence, and saved them to be called; and by calling
        them, had reserved them by his grace, and preserved them by his power,
        from the general unbelief, impenitence, blindness, and ignorance, which
        prevailed over the people of the Jews; which reserve was not owing to
        their superior goodness, they being in no wise, with respect to nature,
        birth, and privileges, better than those who were not reserved; nor to
        the disposition of their minds and wills, their minds and consciences
        being defiled, and their wills naturally as obstinate and perverse as
        others; nor to any good works done by them, since works before calling
        are not properly good, and those after are the fruits of that grace: but
        this reverse was made,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to the election of grace; God's choice of these persons before
        the world was, which is the source and spring of all the blessings of
        grace, both in time eternity: hence these persons were put into the
        hands of Christ, secured in an everlasting covenant, took special care
        of by divine Providence, were called by grace, justified, sanctified,
        and at last glorified: and this choice is owing to grace, for not men's
        choice of God's grace, but God's choice, owing to his, own grace, is
        here meant. The Pelagians would have it, that this election is the
        choice which man makes of the grace of God: whereas such is the enmity
        of mans nature, and will against God and his grace, that he would never
        make choice of that, if the grace of God did not first make choice of
        him, and lay hold upon him: grace here, does not design the object of
        the choice, but the cause, spring, and motive of it, which is not any
        habit or quality in men, as faith and holiness, for these are fruits and
        effects of electing grace, and so not causes, motives, or conditions of
        it, but the free love and favour of God in his own heart; and shows the
        sovereignty and freeness of election, which is no ways depending on the
        will and works of men, but upon the sovereign good will and pleasure of
        God.

      </p>
      And if by grace, then is it no more of works,.... Upon election, being
      called "the election of grace", the apostle forms an argument, showing the
      contrariety and inconsistency of grace, and works, in that affair;
      proving, that it must be by the one or the other: and if by the one, then
      not by the other; and that these two cannot be mixed and blended together
      in this matter. If election is "by grace", as it certainly is; for no
      other reason can be given why God has chose one, and not another, but his
      own sovereign pleasure, or that free favour and unmerited love, with which
      he loves one and not another; and not because they are better, or had done
      or would do better things than others; "then it is no more", or not at
      all, for it never was "of works", was not influenced by them, does not
      arise from them, for it passed before ever any were done; and those that
      are done aright spring from it, and therefore could never be the rule and
      measure, causes, motives, and conditions of it;
      <p></p>
      <p>otherwise grace is no more grace; for</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "grace (as Austin has long ago observed) is not grace, unless it is
        altogether freed;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it will lose its nature, and ought to change its name, and be no more
        called or reckoned grace, but a due debt; and a choice of persons to
        salvation should be thought, not to be what God is free to make or not,
        but what he is obliged to, as a reward of debt to men's works:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but if it be of works, then it is no more grace; if election springs
        from, and depends upon the works of men, let no man ascribe it to the
        grace of God; for there is nothing of grace in it, if this be the case:
      </p>
      <p></p>

        otherwise work is no more work; that will free gift: but these things
        are contrary to one another; and so unalienable and unalterable in their
        natures, that the one cannot pass into the other, or the one be joined
        with the other, in this or any other part of man's salvation; for what
        is here said of election, holds true of justification, pardon of sin,
        and the whole of salvation. The Ethiopic version applies it to
        justification.

      What then?.... What can be said to the point the apostle is upon? it is as
      clear as the sun, out of all question, that God has not cast away all the
      people of the Jews, nor any whom he foreknew, any age or period of time;
      neither in the time Elijah, nor in the apostle's, he always having a
      reserve of some for himself; which reserve is owing to a previous choice
      of them, and that previous choice to ascribed not to any works of theirs,
      but to his free grace and sovereign pleasure. Indeed
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; that is, carnal
        Israel, the body and bulk of that people; who sought for life and
        righteousness by their obedience to the law, and which they in general
        were in quest of, and pursuit after, but did not obtain, though, some of
        them might imagine they did; for the thing was impracticable and
        impossible, no life nor righteousness are ever to be had by the law of
        works; they did not obtain life and righteousness, because they sought
        them in a wrong place and in a wrong way; they sought them not by faith
        in Christ Jesus, where they are only to be had, but by their own works,
        which fall abundantly short of procuring them for them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but the election hath obtained it. The apostle divides Israel into two
        parts, "the election and the rest": by "the election" he means, elect
        men, the remnant among them, whom God had reserved for himself; just as
        "circumcision" designs circumcised persons, and "uncircumcision"
        uncircumcised persons, and "calling" called ones, and "righteousness"
        righteous men and women; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#030">Rom 3:30</a>
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#013">Pe2 3:13</a>. Now these chosen
        ones obtained mercy, grace, life, and righteousness in Christ, as the
        apostle himself did, who was one of them; and that by virtue, and in
        consequence of their election, for which reason the word is here used;
        hence mercy was shown them, grace was bestowed upon them, the
        righteousness of Christ was imputed to them, faith was given them,
        holiness was wrought in them, and they entitled to, and made meet for
        eternal life: these among Israel then obtained such favours and
        blessings; and so God's elect, in all ages and nations, obtain the same
        things, and will obtain; for the purpose of God according to election
        stands sure, his word and oath are immutable, his covenant inviolable,
        his grace inalienable, and his power omnipotent:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the rest were blinded: the non-elect, or those who were not chosen
        and reserved, to whom Christ was "a stone of stumbling and a rock of
        offence"; and who "stumbled at the word" of the Gospel, "being
        disobedient" to the divine revelation, "whereunto they were appointed",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008">Pe1 2:8</a>; hence they
        obtained no mercy, grace, faith, life, righteousness, and eternal
        salvation, but were "blinded"; left in that native blindness and
        ignorance, in which they were born and brought up; were blinded by
        themselves wilfully more and more; as they knew not the Messiah, so
        neither would they understand; they sinned wilfully against light
        knowledge; they shut their eyes against all that evidence and
        demonstration given, of Jesus of Nazareth being the Messiah, by his
        doctrines and miracles; and they were blinded by Satan, the god of this
        world, by whom they were led captive; who wrought effectually in them,
        and stirred up the malice and enmity of their minds against Christ and
        his Gospel; for they were of their father the devil, and his lusts they
        would do; and they were also blinded by God himself, so that they could
        not believe; for after all this, it was but just with God to give them
        up to judicial blindness and hardness of heart.

      According as it is written,.... In
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010">Isa 29:10</a> which passages the
      apostle seems to refer to, though it is not exactly word for word as here,
      yet the sense is the same:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God hath given them the spirit of slumber; or of stupidity and
        insensibility, so that they were as persons in a deep sleep; their
        senses locked up, without any knowledge of, or concern about, the danger
        they were in; having no sense of sin, or of the need of a Saviour; or of
        their being upon the borders of eternal ruin and damnation, or of any
        ways and means to escape it; but careless and secure, as persons fast
        asleep in the midst of the sea, or upon the top of a mast, who, when
        stricken and beaten, feel it not; but if by jogging are awaked at all,
        immediately return to sleep again, and so sleep the sleep of eternal
        death:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        eyes that they should not see; which being closed by the deep sleep and
        stupidity of mind they were judicially given up to, could see no beauty
        in Christ, wherefore they should desire him; none of the glories and
        excellencies of his person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice;
        noticing amiable and agreeable in his Gospel, and the truths of it; nor
        had they any light in the prophets of the Old Testament, which were so
        remarkably fulfilled in him; their minds were blinded, a vail was upon
        their hearts, and which remains to this day:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and ears that they should not hear; for persons in a sleep, as their
        eyes are closed that they cannot see, so their ears are stopped that
        they cannot hear: and thus it was with these Jews, the awful judgment
        being upon them; they were uncircumcised in heart and ears; they were
        like the deaf adder, stopping their ears to the charming voice of Christ
        in the Gospel; and being given up in a judicial way, could neither
        understand his speech, nor hear his word: and this spirit of stupidity
        and insensibility, as it appeared in the times of Isaiah, so it
        continued
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        unto this day; the then present time, in which the apostle lived; and
        has continued ever since, at least in part, and will until the fulness
        of the Gentiles is brought in. These passages, with some others
        following, are produced by the apostle out of their own prophets, to
        take off their resentment against him; and lest, he should be thought to
        be severe upon them, when he said no more of them, but what had been
        prophesied long before concerning them. So Jarchi on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010">Isa 29:10</a>; says, that
        Isaiah prophesies , "concerning the transgressors of Israel".

      And David saith,.... That is, Christ by the mouth of David, or David in
      the person of Christ; for the psalm out of which the following words are
      taken is a prophecy of the Messiah, as appears from some passages cited
      out of it in the New Testament, and applied to Christ; compare
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#004">Rom 11:4</a> with
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#025">Joh 15:25</a>, and
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#009">Rom 11:9</a> with
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#017">Joh 2:17</a>, and
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#021">Rom 11:21</a> with
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#028">Joh 19:28</a>; and what are here
      cited are not so much imprecations, as predictions of what should befall
      the Jews, by way of recompense for their ill usage of the Messiah, in
      giving him gall for meat, and vinegar for drink (Mat 27:34)
      <p></p>
      <p>
        let their table be made a snare, and a trap and a stumbling block. By
        their "table" may be meant, the altar; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#007">Mal 1:7</a>; and the
        sacrifices offered up upon it, their meat offerings and drink offerings,
        and all others; likewise the laws concerning the difference of meats,
        and indeed the whole ceremonial law may be intended, which lay in meats
        and drinks, and such like things: now the Jews placing their justifying
        righteousness before God, in the observance of these rites and
        ceremonies, and imagining that by these sacrifices their sins were
        really expiated and atoned for, they neglected and submitted not to the
        righteousness of Christ, but went about to establish their own; so that
        that which should have led them to Christ, became an handwriting of
        ordinances against them, and rendered Christ of no effect to them:
        moreover, the sacred writings, which are full of spiritual food and
        divine refreshment, the prophecies of the Old Testament, which clearly
        pointed out Christ, not being understood, but misapplied by them, proved
        a trap, a snare, and a stumbling block to them; so that they rejected
        the true Messiah, which issued in their utter ruin and destruction: yea,
        the preaching of the Gospel, the salutary truths and wholesome words of
        our Lord Jesus Christ, were a stumbling block to the Jews, nay, even the
        savour of death unto death. Though these words may be literally
        understood of their table mercies, the necessary provisions of life,
        their common food and drink, of which they had great scarcity in their
        last wars; so that they not only by wicked methods stole it from one
        another, but ate what was forbidden by their law, and what was abhorrent
        to nature, as one is said to eat her own child; nor is it to be
        overlooked what is suggested by some, that the passover may be meant by
        their "table"; which was their grand yearly feast, and which they were
        eating (s) when they were surrounded and taken by the Roman army, like
        birds in a net, or beasts in a trap: and all this as
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        a recompense to them; a just judgment upon them, by way of retaliation
        for their ill treatment of Christ when on the cross, giving him gall and
        vinegar for his meat and drink.

      Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,.... Which is to be
      understood not literally of their being struck with blindness, as the men
      of Sodom were by the angels, and as Elymas the sorcerer was by the Apostle
      Paul; but mystically, of the eyes of their understandings being darkened,
      as they were by themselves and by Satan, and judicially by God; so that
      they could not see into the true same of the prophecies and promises
      concerning Christ; and how all the characters of the Messiah met in Jesus
      of Nazareth; their eyes were so blinded, that they could see no beauty nor
      comeliness in him; no excellency in his person, nothing wonderful in his
      works, nor amiable in his doctrine; nay, not only spiritual things, the
      things of the Gospel, were hid from the most wise and prudent among them,
      from their doctors and Rabbins, but also the things which regarded their
      temporal peace and happiness were hid from their eyes; their eyes were not
      only darkened with respect to things spiritual and evangelical, but even
      with regard to things natural and civil: never did a people act more
      imprudently for their temporal safety and welfare, or appear so infatuated
      in all their conduct, as they did, as the history of their wars does
      abundantly declare:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and bow down their back alway; which may denote their subjection and
        bondage to the Romans, when taken and carried captive by them; who laid
        very heavy burdens on them, which bowed down their backs indeed,
        multitudes of them being condemned to the mines; or this may design the
        general disposition of the minds of these people, which are bowed to the
        earth, for they mind nothing but earth and earthly things; the acquiring
        of which they are bent upon at any rate, and are infamous for their
        earthly mindedness, covetousness, extortion, usury, tricking, and over
        reaching: or this phrase may be expressive of that trembling, distress,
        horror, and despair, which shall seize them; especially when the son of
        man comes in the clouds of heaven, and they that have pierced him shall
        behold him, and wail because of trim; for in the Psalms the words are,
        "make their loins continually to shake",
