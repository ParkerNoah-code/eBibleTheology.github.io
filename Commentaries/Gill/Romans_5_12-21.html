      Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world,.... The design of
      these words, and of the following, is to show how men came to be in the
      condition before described, as "ungodly" (Rom 5:6) "sinners" (Rom 5:8) and "enemies",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</a>; and to express the
      love of Christ in the redemption of them; and the largeness of God's grace
      to all sorts of men: the connection of them is with
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#011">Rom 5:11</a>, by which it
      appears that the saints have not only an expiation of sin by the blood of
      Christ, but a perfect righteousness, by which they are justified in the
      sight of God; and the manner how they came at it, or this becomes theirs,
      together with the necessity of their having such an one, are here
      declared: by the "one man" is meant Adam the first man, and parent of
      mankind, who is mentioned by name in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014">Rom 5:14</a>; sin which came by
      him designs a single sin, and not many, even the first sin of Adam, which
      goes by different names, as "sin" here, "transgression" (Rom 5:14) the "offence" or
      "fall" (Rom 5:15)
      "disobedience" (Rom 5:19)
      and whatever was the first step or motive to it, which led to it, whether
      pride, unbelief, or concupiscence, it was finished by eating the forbidden
      fruit; and is called sin emphatically, because it contained all sin in it,
      was attended with aggravating circumstances, and followed with dismal
      consequences. Hence may be learnt the origin of moral evil among men,
      which comes not from God, but man; of this it is said, that it "entered
      into the world"; not the world above, there sin entered by the devil; but
      the world below, and it first entered into paradise, and then passed
      through the whole world; it entered into men by the snares of Satan, and
      by him it enters into all the inhabitants of the world; into all men that
      descend from him by ordinary generation, and that so powerfully that there
      is no stopping of it. It has entered by him, not by imitation, for it has
      entered into such as never sinned after the similitude of his
      transgression, infants, or otherwise death could not have entered into
      them, and into such who never heard of it, as the Heathens; besides, sin
      entered as death did, which was not by imitation but imputation, for all
      men are reckoned dead in Adam, being accounted sinners in him; add to
      this, that in the same way Christ's righteousness comes upon us, which is
      by imputation, Adam's sin enters into us, or becomes ours; upon which
      death follows,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and death by sin; that is, death has entered into the world of men by
        sin, by the first sin of the first man; not only corporeal death, but a
        spiritual or moral one, man, in consequence of this, becoming "dead in
        sin", deprived of righteousness, and averse, and impotent to all that is
        good; and also an eternal death, to which he is liable; for "the wages
        of sin is death",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023">Rom 6:23</a>; even eternal
        death: all mankind are in a legal sense dead, the sentence of
        condemnation and death immediately passed on Adam as soon as he had
        sinned, and upon all his posterity;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and so death passed upon all men; the reason of which was,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>for that, or because "in him"</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        all have sinned: all men were naturally and seminally in him; as he was
        the common parent of mankind, he had all human nature in him, and was
        also the covenant head, and representative of all his posterity; so that
        they were in him both naturally and federally, and so "sinned in him";
        and fell with him by his first transgression into condemnation and
        death. The ancient Jews, and some of the modern ones, have said many
        things agreeably to the apostle's doctrine of original sin; they own the
        imputation of the guilt of Adam's sin to his posterity to condemnation
        and death;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "through the sin of the first man (say they (g)) , "thou art dead"; for
        he brought death into the world:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nothing is more frequently said by them than that Adam and Eve, through
        the evil counsel of the serpent, , "were the cause of death to
        themselves and to all the world" (h); and that through the eating of the
        fruit of the tree, , "all the inhabitants of the earth became guilty of
        death" (i): and that this was not merely a corporeal death, they gather
        from the doubling of the word in the threatening, "in dying thou shalt
        die",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#017">Gen 2:17</a> (margin);
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "this doubled death, say they (k), without doubt is the punishment of
        their body by itself, , and also of the "soul by itself".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        They speak of some righteous persons who died, not for any sin of their
        own, but purely on the account of Adam's sin; as Benjamin the son of
        Jacob, Amram the father of Moses, and Jesse the father of David, and
        Chileab the son of David (l), to these may be added Joshua the son of
        Nun, and Zelophehad and Levi: the corruption and pollution of human
        nature through the sin of Adam is clearly expressed by them;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "when Adam sinned, (say they (m),) he "drew upon him a defiled power, ,
        "and defiled himself and all the people of the "world".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Again (n),</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "this vitiosity which comes from the sin and infection of our first
        parents, has invaded both faculties of the rational soul, the
        understanding by which we apprehend, and the will by which we desire.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This corruption of nature they call , "the evil imagination", which,
        they say (o), is planted in a man's heart at the time of his birth; and
        others say (p) that it is in him before he is born: hence Philo the Jew
        says (q), that , "to sin is connatural", to every man that is born, even
        though a good man; and talks (r) of , "evil that is born with us", and
        of (s) , "spots that are of necessity born with" every mortal man. And
        so his countrymen (t) often speak of it as natural and inseparable to
        men; yea, they represent Adam as the root and head of mankind, in whom
        the whole world and all human nature sinned: descanting on those words,
        "as one that lieth upon the top of a mast",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#034">Pro 23:34</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "this (say they (u)) is the first man who was "an head to all the
        children of men": for by means of wine death was inflicted on him, and
        he was the cause of bringing the sorrows of death into the world.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And in another place, speaking of Adam, they say (w), that</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "he was , "the root of the creation", or "of the men of the world"; and
        death was inflicted upon him and on his seed, because he sinned one sin
        in eating of the tree.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And it is observed,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that , the "He" demonstrative is not prefixed in Scripture to proper
        names, which yet is to the word "Adam"; the reason is, (say they (x),)
        because in Adam all his posterity are pointed at, and the whole human
        species designed.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Again, they observe (y), that</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "the end of man is to die, of which this is the reason, because ,
        "mankind" has sinned; that is, the nature of which he is composed, or in
        other words, Adam and Eve have sinned.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Once more (z).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "when he (Adam) sinned, , "all the whole world sinned", and his sin we
        bear;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and (a) that</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "the whole congregation of Israel have need of atonement for the sin of
        the first Adam, for he was , reckoned as the whole congregation;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>which exactly tallies with the apostle's assertion in this text.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        (When this commentary was written, it was generally accepted that all
        the fossils in the rocks were laid down by Noah's world wide flood and
        that the universe was about 6000 years old. Since that time, science has
        postualated that life evolved over billions of years and that the
        fossils are a result of this evolutionary process. If you accept the
        Bible as your authority you cannot accept the theory of evolution in any
        form. Firstly, the biblical chronology restricts the age of the universe
        to about 6000 years. Secondly, in order to get fossils, animals must
        die. This verse tells us that sin, not evolution, is the cause of death.
        Death and suffering did not exist until after Adam sinned. Hence before
        Adam sinned, no animal died and it would be impossible for any fossils
        to form. Before the fall, all animals ate plants, not other animals
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#030">Gen 1:30</a>. Paul tells us in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#020">Rom 8:20</a> that Adam's sin
        subjected all of creation to the curse, not just mankind. See Gill on

      </p>
      For until the law, sin was in the world,.... This is a proof of sin's
      having entered into the world, by one man's transgression of the positive
      law of God, which forbid him the eating of the fruit of the tree of
      knowledge of good and evil; since it was in the world before the law of
      Moses was given: the sin of Adam and the guilt of that were in the world
      before, and came upon all men to condemnation; the general corruption of
      nature appeared before; and actual sins, and transgressions of all sorts
      were committed before; as by the immediate posterity of Adam, by the men
      of the old world, by the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, by the
      patriarchs and their posterity, by the Egyptians, Canaanites, and others.
      They were all guilty of sin, corrupted by it, and under the dominion of
      it, except such as were released from it by the grace of God: now when sin
      is said to be until this time, the meaning is not that it existed and
      continued until the law of Moses took place, and then ceased; for that law
      did not, and could not take away sin, it rather increased it, at least it
      became more known by it; but that it was in being before it, and had
      influence and power over the sons of men, so as to subject them to death:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but sin is not imputed when there is no law. This looks like an
        objection, that if there was no law before Moses's time, then there was
        no sin, nor could any action of man be known or accounted by them as
        sinful, or be imputed to them to condemnation; or rather it is a
        concession, allowing that where there is no law, sin is not imputed; but
        there was a law before that law of Moses, which law was transgressed,
        and the sin or transgression of it was imputed to men to condemnation
        and death, as appears from what follows.
      </p>

      Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses,.... Though the law of Moses
      was not yet given, death exerted itself, and extended its dominion over
      all the sons and daughters of Adam, during the interval between Adam and
      Moses; which clearly shows that sin was in the world, and that there must
      be a law in being, which that was a transgression of: death is represented
      as a king, as sin and Satan sometimes are; and indeed, death reigns by
      sin, and Satan both by sin and death; their empires rise, stand, and fall
      together. So Bildad calls death "the king of terrors",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#014">Job 18:14</a>; and a very
      formidable and powerful king he is; his dominion is very large, his power
      uncontrollable, and the dread of him very great, especially to Christless
      sinners. The Jews say (b), that at the resurrection the world will be
      renewed, and will not be as at the first, when , "death reigned in the
      world"; referring to the same period of time the apostle here does. The
      subjects of his government were not only adult persons, who had been
      guilty of many actual transgressions, but he reigned
      <p></p>
      <p>
        even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
        transgression. This does not exclude the dominion of death over such who
        had sinned after the likeness of Adam, but rather confirms its power
        over them; nor does it intend adult Gentiles, who did not sin in the
        same manner, nor against the same law, as Adam did; but it designs
        infants, not yet guilty of actual sin; and therefore since death reigns
        over them, who only holds and exercises his dominion by virtue of sin,
        it follows, that they must have original sin in them; the guilt of
        Adam's transgression must be imputed to them, and the corruption of
        nature, from him, derived unto them, or it could not reign over them. A
        child of a year old, the Jewish doctors (c) say, has not tasted the
        taste of sin, that is, has not committed actual sin; and observe (d),
        that young children die on account of the sins of their parents: but the
        true reason of their dying is here suggested by the apostle; which is
        the transgression of Adam:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who is the figure of him that was to come; meaning, either his posterity
        that were to come out of his loins, whose figure, type, and
        representative he was; or rather Christ, who is sometimes called , "he
        that was to come"; and the Arabic version reads the words thus, "who was
        a type of Adam that was expected"; that is, of Christ the second Adam,
        that was expected to come, according to the promise and prophecy: of him
        the first Adam was a type, in his human nature, in the formation and
        quality of it; as the first Adam was made by God of the virgin earth,
        the second Adam was born of a virgin; as the first, so the second Adam
        was pure, holy, upright, and wise; in his office, as Lord of the world,
        head of the woman, priest in his house, and prophet to his posterity; in
        his marriage with Eve, a figure of the church; but in nothing more
        clearly than in his being a covenant head to all his offspring: and this
        is what the apostle chiefly designs, since he runs the parallel between
        them on this account in the following verses; showing, that as the one
        conveyed sin and death to all his seed, so the other communicates
        righteousness and life to all that belong to him. So the Jews say (e),
        that by Adam is intimated the righteous branch, the Messiah; and that ,
        "the secret of Adam is the secret of the Messiah".

      But not as the offence, so also is the free gift,.... By "the offence", or
      "fall", as the word signifies, is meant the first sin of Adam; by which he
      offended God, and fell from that estate in which he was created, and all
      his posterity with him; and by the "free gift" is meant, the righteousness
      of Christ, which justifies from that, and all other offences: now, though
      there is a great likeness between Adam and Christ; both are men, the first
      Adam is called "the one man", and so is the second Adam Jesus Christ;
      partly for the sake of the comparison between him and the first, and also
      to express the truth of his human nature; and because the Redeemer ought
      to be a man, though not a mere man; both are sole authors of what they
      convey to their respective offspring, Adam of sin, Christ of
      righteousness; both convey single things, Adam only one sin, not more, for
      when he had committed one sin, he broke the covenant made with him and his
      posterity, and so ceased in after acts to be a representative of them;
      Christ conveys his righteousness, or obedience to the law, without any
      additional works of righteousness of ours to complete it; and both convey
      what they do, "to all" their respective offspring: yet there is a
      dissimilitude between them, as to the manner of conveyance and the effects
      thereof; the offence or sin of Adam is conveyed in a natural way, or by
      natural generation, to all who descend from him in that manner; the
      righteousness of Christ is conveyed in a way of grace, to his spiritual
      seed: hence it is called, not only the "free gift", but "the grace of God,
      and the gift by grace", which is "by one man, Jesus Christ"; because of
      the grace of the Father, in fixing and settling the method of
      justification, by the righteousness of his Son; in sending him to work out
      one, that would be satisfying to law and justice; and in his gracious
      acceptation of it, on the behalf of his people, and the imputation of it
      to them; and because of the grace of the Son in becoming man, in being
      made under the law, yea, made sin and a curse, in order to bring in an
      everlasting righteousness; and because of the grace of the Spirit, in
      revealing and applying it, and working faith to receive it; for as the
      righteousness itself is a free grace gift, bestowed upon unworthy persons,
      so is faith likewise, by which it is laid hold on and embraced: and as
      there is a disagreement in the manner of conveying these things, so
      likewise in the effects they have upon the persons to whom they are
      conveyed; and the apostle argues from the influence and effect the one
      has, to the far greater and better influence and effect the other has:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for if through the offence of one many be dead; as all Adam's posterity
        are, not only subject to a corporeal death, but involved in a moral or
        spiritual, and liable to an eternal one, through the imputation of
        guilt, and the derivation of a corrupt nature from him: then
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man,
        Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many; that is, the righteousness of
        Christ, in which the grace of God is so illustrious, is much more
        effectual to the giving of life to all his seed and offspring; not
        barely such a life as Adam had in innocence, and which he lost by the
        offence, but a spiritual and an eternal one; which sheds the exuberance
        of this grace, which secures and adjudges to a better life than what was
        lost by the fall.

      And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift,.... The apostle goes
      on with the dissimilitude between the effects of Adam's sin, and Christ's
      righteousness:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for the judgment was by one to condemnation; by "judgment" is meant, not
        the judgment of God, or the judiciary sentence pronounced by God on Adam
        and his posterity for sin; but the guilt of the one man's sin, which is
        imputed to all men to condemnation, on account of which the sentence of
        condemnation passed on all men; the law transgressed, became a
        ministration of condemnation to them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but the free gift is of many offences unto justification; the
        righteousness of Christ, which stands opposed to the guilt of Adam's
        sin, being imputed to all his offspring, is to the justification of
        them; and that not only from the guilt of that particular offence, but
        from many other offences, even all their actual sins and transgressions,
        of every sort; which is another instance of the exuberance, or abounding
        of the grace of God, in the righteousness of Christ, not only over the
        sin of the one man, but also over the sins of many, even all the elect
        of God; for the last clause may be also thus rendered, "the free gift is
        of the offences of many, unto justification".

      For if by one man's offence death reigned by one,.... It may be rendered,
      "by one offence death reigned by one"; for it was the single sin of Adam,
      the first sin that was committed by him, which gave death its reigning
      power over the sons of men:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Adam, say (f) the Jewish doctors, transgressed, , one commandment of
        the law,''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and was the cause of death to himself, and to all the world. These words
        are a repetition, with a further explanation, of
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015">Rom 5:15</a>; there it is
        said, "through the offence of one many be dead"; here "by one man's
        offence", or "by one offence, death reigned by one"; in which death is
        represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only
        corporeal death, which has mounted the throne by sin, and is supported
        in its dominion by an ordinance of heaven; but also a moral or spiritual
        death, which has seized on all mankind, and reigns in every power and
        faculty of the soul of man; and likewise an eternal one, which will have
        power over all those, who have no part in the first resurrection: in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#015">Rom 5:15</a>, "the grace of
        God, and the gift by grace", are said to "abound unto many"; here they
        are said to
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness: by
        abundance of grace is designed, either something distinct from the
        justifying righteousness of Christ; such as the abundant grace and mercy
        of God, in regeneration and conversion; the various graces of the Spirit
        then implanted; the many things then wrought in the heart; the large
        discoveries! of pardoning grace, and the abundance of the love of God
        shed abroad in the soul by the Spirit: or rather the same with "the gift
        of righteousness", because of the large display of the grace of God in
        it; by which "righteousness" is meant, not righteousness or holiness
        infused into us; but the righteousness of Christ, which is a free grace
        gift, and is enjoyed in a way of receiving; which denotes the act of
        faith, and supposes giving; and hence there is no room for boasting, but
        great reason for thankfulness: now such persons who have received this
        abundant grace and free gift,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ; in corporeal life, they are
        not now subject to death as a penal evil, as other persons are, and
        though they die this death, they will triumph over it in the
        resurrection morn, they will rise again to everlasting life; they reign
        now in spiritual life over sin, Satan, and the world; and they will
        reign in eternal life, they will sit on thrones, wear crowns, and
        possess a kingdom of glory for ever and ever; and all by and through
        one, Jesus Christ, and not on account of any works, or merits of theirs.

      Therefore as by the offence of one,.... Or by one offence, as before, the
      guilt of which is imputed to, and
      <p></p>
      <p>
        judgment came upon all men to condemnation; which word is used in a
        legal sense, and intends condemnation to eternal death, as appears from
        the antithesis in the text; for if "justification of life", means an
        adjudging to eternal life, as it certainly does, the judgment or guilt,
        which is unto condemnation, must design a condemnation to eternal death,
        the just wages of sin: and this sentence of condemnation comes upon all
        men, all the sons of Adam without exception, even upon the elect of God
        themselves; though it is not executed upon them, but on their surety,
        whereby they are delivered from it:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men to
        justification of life; the righteousness of Christ being freely imputed
        without works, as it is to all the men that belong to the second Adam,
        to all his seed and offspring, is their justification of life, or what
        adjudges and entitles them to eternal life. The sentence of
        justification was conceived in the mind of God from eternity, when his
        elect were ordained unto eternal life, on the foot of his Son's
        righteousness; this passed on Christ at his resurrection from the dead,
        and on all his people as considered in him, when they, in consequence of
        it, were quickened together with him; and this passes upon the
        conscience of a sinner at believing, when he may, as he should, reckon
        himself alive unto God, and is what gives him a right and title to
        everlasting life and glory.

      For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners,.... Agreeably to
      this the Jews say (g), that
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "for the sin of the first man, all that are born of him, , "become
        wicked".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This is the sum of what is said in the foregoing verses, that as by
        Adam's sin all his posterity are made sinners, and so are brought under
        a sentence of condemnation; in like manner by the obedience of Christ,
        all his seed are made righteous, and come under a sentence of
        justification of life: the persons made sinners are said to be "many",
        in opposition to the "one man", by whose disobedience they became so,
        and because there is an exception of one, even Jesus Christ; and mean
        all the natural descendants of Adam, who are many, and are so called, to
        answer to the subjects of justification in the next clause: what they
        are made sinners by, is "the disobedience of one man, Adam"; and by the
        first and single disobedience of his, in eating the fruit of the
        forbidden tree, by which they "were made sinners": the meaning of which
        is not, that they became sufferers for it, or subject to death on the
        account of it; the word used will not bear such a sense, but signifies
        men guilty of sin, and sometimes the worst and chief of sinners;
        besides, the apostle had expressed that before; add to this, that the
        sons of Adam could not be sufferers for his sin, or subject to death on
        account of it, if they were not made sinners by it, or involved in the
        guilt or it: and though the posterity of Adam are habitually sinners,
        that is, derive corrupt nature from Adam, yet this is not meant here;
        but that they are become guilty, through the imputation of his sin to
        them; for it is by the disobedience of another they are made sinners,
        which must be by the imputation of that disobedience to them; he sinned,
        and they sinned in him, when they had as yet no actual existence; which
        could be no other way, than by imputation, as he was reckoned and
        accounted their head and representative, and they reckoned and accounted
        in him, and so have sinned in him. This is also evident, from the
        sentence of condemnation and death passing upon all men for it; and even
        upon those, who had not actually sinned; to which may be added, that
        Adam's posterity are made sinners through his disobedience, in the same
        way as Christ's seed are made righteous by his obedience, which is by
        the imputation of it to them;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous; not by their
        own obedience; nor by their own obedience and Christ's together; but by
        his sole and single obedience to the law of God: and the persons made
        righteous by it are not all the posterity of Adam, and yet not a few of
        them; but "many", even all the elect of God, and seed of Christ; these
        are all made righteous in the sight of God, are justified from all their
        sins, and entitled to eternal life and happiness.

      Moreover, the law entered,.... By "the law" is meant, not the law of
      nature, much less the law of sin; rather the ceremonial law, which came in
      over and above the moral law; it entered but for a time; by which sin
      abounded, and appeared very sinful; and through it the grace of God much
      more abounded, in the sacrifice of Christ prefigured by it: but the moral
      law, as it came by Moses, is here intended; which entered with great pomp
      and solemnity on Mount Sinai; and intervened, or came between Adam's sin
      and Christ's sacrifice; and also came in besides, or over and above the
      promise of life by Christ; and may moreover be said to enter into the
      conscience of a sinner, with the power and energy of the Spirit of God:
      and the end of its entrance is,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that the offence might abound; meaning either the sin of Adam, he had
        been speaking of under that name, that that itself, and the imputation
        of it to his posterity, and also the pollution of human nature by it,
        together with all the aggravating circumstances of it, might appear more
        manifest; or sin in general, any and all actual transgressions, which
        abound through the law's discovering the evil nature of them, and so
        taking away all excuse, or pretext of ignorance: by prohibiting them,
        whereby the corrupt nature of man becomes more eager after them; and by
        accusing, threatening, terrifying, and condemning, on account of them:
        one view of the apostle in this, doubtless, is to show, that there can
        be no justification by the law:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: sin has abounded in
        human nature, in all the individuals of it; and grace has superabounded
        in the same nature, being assumed by the Son of God, and united to him,
        who has appeared in it "full of grace and truth" (Joh 1:14) sin has abounded
        in all the powers and faculties of the soul, in the understanding, will,
        and affections, of an unregenerate man; but in regeneration, the grace
        of God much more abounds in the same powers and faculties, enlightening
        the understanding, subduing the will, and influencing the affections
        with love to divine things: sin abounded in the Gentile world, before
        the preaching of the Gospel in it; but afterwards grace did superabound
        in the conversion of multitudes in it from idols, to serve the living
        God; and where sin has abounded in particular persons to a very great
        height, grace has exceeded it, as in Manasseh, Mary Magdalene, Saul, and
        others.

      That as sin hath reigned unto death,.... This is another end of the law's
      entrance, or rather an illustration of the grace of God, by comparing the
      reigns of sin and grace together: sin has such a power over man in a state
      of nature, as amounts to a dominion; it has not only an enticing,
      ensnaring power, to draw into a compliance with it, and an obstructive
      power to hinder that which is good, and an operative one of that which is
      evil, and a captivating, enslaving one to the same; but it has a kingly,
      governing, and commanding power: its dominion is universal as to men, and
      with respect both to the members of the body, and faculties of the soul;
      it is supported by laws, which are its lusts; and has its voluntary
      subjects, to whom it gives wages; its reign is very cruel and tyrannical;
      it is "unto death" corporeal, moral, or spiritual, and eternal. The
      ancient Jews often represent sin in the same light; they frequently speak
      (h) of , "the corruption of nature reigning" over men; and say (i): that
      he is "a king" over the several members of the body, which answer to him
      at the word of command. "The old and foolish king" in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013">Ecc 4:13</a>, is commonly
      interpreted by them of sin; which they say (k) is called "a king", because
      he rules in the world, over the children of men, and because all hearken
      to him: it is a petition much used by them (l),
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "let not the evil imagination or corruption of nature "rule" over me:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and on the other hand, they represent grace, or a principle of goodness,
        as a king, reigning over the corruption of nature; thus interpreting
        these words, "my son, fear thou the Lord and the king", they ask (m),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "who is the king? the king (say they) , is "the good imagination", or
        principle of goodness, who reigns over the evil imagination, which is
        called a king.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And in another place (n) they say of a good man, that he , "caused the
        good imagination to reign" over the evil one; with which in some measure
        agrees what follows:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by
        Jesus Christ our Lord; by grace is meant, either grace as it is in the
        heart of God; which reigns or bears sway in man's salvation in all the
        parts of it, "through righteousness"; consistent with the justice of
        God, in a way in which that is glorified, through the redemption of
        Christ: it reigns "unto eternal life"; grace has promised, prepared it,
        and makes meet for it, and will introduce into it, and freely give it:
        it reigns "by Jesus Christ"; grace reigns by him, righteousness, or
        justice, is glorified by him, and eternal life is in him, through him,
        and by him: or grace as it is in the hearts of converted persons, is
        meant where it reigns, has the dominion, is the governing principle, and
        that in a way of righteousness and true holiness; and will reign until
        it is perfected in glory, or is crowned with eternal life; all which are
        by Jesus Christ, namely, grace, righteousness, and life.
