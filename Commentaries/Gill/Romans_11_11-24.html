      I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall?.... This is an
      objection, which the apostle takes from the mouth of an adversary; and the
      purport of it is, you say that the people of the Jews being blind, have
      stumbled at Christ and his Gospel, as was prophesied of them, and to which
      they were appointed; pray what were God's view and end in this? was it
      that they should fall and perish eternally? if it be so, is not this doing
      himself, what he forbids others, namely, "to put a stumblingblock before
      the blind?"
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#014">Lev 19:14</a>, and can he be
      excused from cruelty, and rejoicing at the misery of others? or is their
      stumbling permitted, that they should "all" fall through unbelief, and be
      cast away? and so it is an objection of the same kind with
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#001">Rom 11:1</a>; or since they have
      stumbled, and have thereby fell into a forlorn and miserable condition,
      are they always to continue in it, as the last clause in the above cited
      passage suggests? To which the apostle answers,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God forbid; neither of these are to be admitted of. The end which God
        had in view, in suffering the Jews to stumble and fall, was not their
        destruction, but rather the salvation of the Gentiles; and especially
        not the destruction of "all" of them, blindness had only happened "in
        part" to them; for there was a remnant among them according to the
        election of grace, which should be saved; a chosen number, which
        obtained life and righteousness by Christ; yea, a fulness of them, how
        small soever their number might be now, which should be brought in; and
        still less that they should always continue in this sad condition, their
        unbelief had brought them into; for the time would come, when there
        would be a receiving of them as life from the dead, when all Israel
        should be saved. And at present there appeared nothing ill in view,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but rather through their fall, salvation is come unto the Gentiles. That
        is, the Gospel; which is sometimes called salvation, the Gospel of our
        salvation, the word of "salvation"; because it is a declaration of
        salvation by Christ, and is the power of God unto it; or a means made
        effectual by the power of God to convince persons, both of their need,
        and of the worth of it, and also a means of the application of it to
        them, by the Spirit of God: now this came to the Gentiles by the
        ministry of the apostles, according to the orders and command of Christ;
        and that through the fall of the Jews, their unbelief and rejection of
        the Messiah; for the Gospel was first preached to them, but they
        contradicting and blaspheming it, the apostles turned to the Gentiles,
        and preached it to them, as the Lord had commanded them: and thus they
        came to be acquainted with the doctrine of salvation by a crucified
        Christ, and to have it powerfully applied to their souls by the Spirit
        of God; when salvation might be said to "come" to them, in such sense as
        our Lord says it did to Zacchaeus and his house,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#009">Luk 19:9</a>, and another end
        is to be answered hereby; which is
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for to provoke them to jealousy: that is, to provoke the Jews to
        jealousy; not in an ill sense, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#019">Rom 10:19</a>, and as they
        were provoked upon the first sending of the Gospel to the Gentiles, and
        the calling of them, when they discovered a great deal of envy, wrath,
        and bitterness; but in a good sense, as will appear in the latter day,
        when being convinced of their sin in rejecting the Messiah, and
        observing the many advantages the Gentiles have received by embracing
        him, and they have lost by their contempt of him, will be provoked to an
        holy emulation of them, and be stirred up through their means to seek
        the Lord their God, and David their King; and thus things will wind
        about in Providence. The fall of the Jews makes way for the Gospel among
        the Gentiles; and this having had its effects with them, will be a means
        of putting the Jews upon serious thoughts about, and a studious inquiry
        after, the true Messiah, and salvation by him; all which is a full
        answer to the question, and the objection contained in it.

      Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world,.... By "the world", as
      is clear from the next clause, is meant the Gentiles; who were frequently
      called so by the Jews, who reckoned themselves to be "the church", and all
      the nations round about them, "the world"; which observation may serve to
      illustrate other passages of Scripture; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016">Joh 3:16</a>; now the fall of
      the Jews, which was a lessening of them, was the riches of the Gentiles;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; the number of
        the true believers in Christ among them were very few, the generality of
        them received him not, but stumbled at him, and fell through unbelief;
        but the few that did believe were the means of carrying and spreading
        the Gospel, which is, "the unsearchable riches of Christ",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#008">Eph 3:8</a>, in the Gentile
        world: thus at first a persecution being raised against the church at
        Jerusalem, the ministers of the Gospel were scattered abroad, and went
        everywhere preaching the word; and afterwards the Jews behaving in a
        very indecent manner towards the apostles of Christ, they turned in a
        manner wholly to the Gentiles; and thus by the means of a few, a
        diminutive company, of which the Apostle Paul was one, the Gospel, the
        pearl of great price, treasure hid in a field, and put into earthen
        vessels, was carried into the Heathen world, and by it they were
        enriched. This handful of men that went out of Judea, were the means of
        converting vast numbers, large multitudes of souls among the Gentiles,
        which may be also designed by "riches": this word sometimes signifying
        plenty, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004">Rom 2:4</a>; and
        also of enriching them with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and of
        directing them to Christ, who has durable riches, treasures of wisdom
        and knowledge, riches of grace, and riches of glory. Now the apostle
        argues, that if such a small number of the Jews who embraced Christ,
        were of so much advantage to the Gentiles,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        how much more their fulness? when converts to Christ among them will be
        as the sand of the sea, a nation of them shall be born again at once,
        and all Israel be saved. This will be a great accession to the Gentile
        church, bring much glory to it, contribute greatly to its welfare, and
        be a means of establishing their faith, and of putting fresh life and
        vigour into them, and of inspiring them with more zeal for Christ, and
        for his honour and glory.

      </p>
      For I speak to you Gentiles,.... The church at Rome, as the primitive
      churches for the most part did, consisted of Jews and Gentiles; hence the
      apostle sometimes addresses the one, as in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017">Rom 2:17</a>, and sometimes the
      other, as here; and this he does to observe unto them the grace and
      goodness of God, in enriching them with the Gospel of salvation; and that
      they might not despise the Jews, from whom it first came out, and through
      whose fall it came to them, and was preached among them by some of that
      nation:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles. He was ordained and set
        apart by God, in his eternal purposes, to be a teacher of the Gentiles;
        he was sent immediately by Christ to bear his name among them, though
        not among them only, to the exclusion of the people of Israel; he
        chiefly preached the Gospel to them, though sometimes to the Jews also;
        and the success of his ministry was mostly among the uncircumcision,
        though he sought by all ways and means to gain both Jews and Gentiles:
        hence he addresses the Gentiles with greater freedom and boldness,
        because he was their apostle, and had been so useful among them; and is
        a reason why we Gentiles should have a special regard to his writings;
        for though every word of God is pure, and all Scripture is divinely
        inspired, and is profitable on one account or other; nor is any part of
        it to be slighted and neglected; yet as Paul's epistles are written
        chiefly to the Gentile churches, excepting that to the Hebrews, and
        which some question whether it is his, they ought especially to be
        attended to by us; though, alas, of all the inspired writings they are
        had in the least esteem:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I magnify mine office: not himself, for he was not of a self-exalting
        spirit, but humble and lowly minded, ready at all times to own himself
        to be less than the least of saints and the chief of sinners; but his
        office, which he had received from Christ, as an instance of his grace
        and favour. This was magnified partly by the miracles, signs, and
        wonders done by him, in proof, and for the confirmation of his
        apostleship; and partly by his constant, diligent, and faithful
        preaching of the Gospel: as also by the unwearied pains he took to
        spread it far and near; and likewise by the numbers of souls he was the
        means of bringing to the knowledge of Christ; and it was no small
        accession of glory to his office, as an apostle of the Gentiles, that he
        was an instrument of the conversion of many among the Jews.

      </p>
      If by any means I may provoke to emulation,.... What he had in view, even
      in discharging his office among the Gentiles with so much labour,
      assiduity, and indefatigableness, was, that if possible he might stir up
      the Jews to emulate and imitate the Gentiles, in seeking after Christ; for
      these he means when he says,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        them which are my flesh; they being his brethren and kinsmen according
        to the flesh, for it was common with the eastern nations to call such
        persons their flesh; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#014">Gen 29:14</a>; and carries in
        it a reason why he was so solicitous for their welfare, because of the
        relation of them to him, and the natural affection he bore towards them;
        and his hope was, that they seeing the nations of the earth blessed in
        the promised seed, through his preaching the Gospel to them, great
        gatherings of the people to Shiloh, and the Gentiles seeking to the root
        of Jesse, set up for an ensign to the people, might be provoked to an
        emulation of them; and likewise seek the Lord their God, and David their
        King, and thereby have his end he so much wished for and desired:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and might save some of them; he says "some", not all, for he knew the
        bulk of the people was rejected, only a seed was left among them, a
        remnant according to the election of grace that should be saved, and
        which did obtain righteousness and life, while the rest were blinded.
        The ministers of the Gospel may be said to save souls, not efficiently,
        for the author or efficient cause of salvation is God only; the Father
        has chose unto it, the Son has effected it, and the Spirit applies it;
        but instrumentally, as the word preached by them is the means of
        regeneration, faith, and conversion, with which salvation is connected:
        and as they show unto men the way of salvation, and encourage souls to
        believe in Christ, in whom alone it is. Now the apostle argues from his
        office, and the usefulness of it, to some among the Jews, to saving
        purposes, to prove that their rejection was not total.

      </p>
      For if the casting away of them,.... This argument, as before, in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#012">Rom 11:12</a>, is from the
      lesser to the greater, showing that as the Gentiles received present
      advantage through the rejection of the Jews, they would receive far
      greater at their future recovery, and which proves that their rejection is
      not final; for by "the casting away of them", is meant the rejection of
      the Jews, and refers to God's writing a "Lo-ammi",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#009">Hos 1:9</a>, upon them, and his
      taking away the Gospel from them, and which were the occasion of
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the reconciling of the world, the Gentiles; not of God's drawing the
        scheme of their reconciliation in his Son; nor of the actual
        reconciliation of them by his sufferings and death; but of the Gospel,
        the word of reconciliation being carried among them upon the Jews'
        disbelief and contempt of it, which was made effectual by the power of
        divine grace, to the reconciling of them to God, to the, way of
        salvation by Christ; to be willing to serve him, and be saved by him;
        to, lay down their arms, surrender to his victorious grace, and become
        obedient to him both by word and deed; and if this was the case then, as
        it was, he asks
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead? By the
        receiving of them is meant the conversion of the Jews in the latter day,
        when they will be received by Christ, on whom they will look with an eye
        of faith, and mourn in an evangelical manner for their sins against him;
        who casts out none that come unto him, but receives them into his arms
        in the most kind and tender manner; and when they will be also openly
        received into the house and family of God, into the visible church of
        Christ; and as the apostle afterwards says, "be grafted into their own
        olive tree",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#024">Rom 11:24</a>; and this their
        restoration will be as "life from the dead"; which regards not so much
        the quickening of the Jews themselves, though their conversion will be,
        as the conversion of every sinner is, a resurrection from the death of
        sin to a life of grace, and is so represented in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#001">Eze 37:1</a>, but rather the
        reviving the work of God among the Gentile churches, who having lain
        long in a dead, lifeless, lukewarm, and indifferent frame of spirit,
        will be aroused and quickened, at this wonderful work of grace upon the
        Jews; and besides it will be as unexpected by them, and as surprising to
        them, as a person's being raised from the dead would be; yea as joyful,
        and as welcome to them, as if a man received his nearest relation and
        friend from the dead; add to this, and which some of the ancients make
        to be the sense of the place, quickly after the conversion of the Jews,
        the fulness of the Gentiles being brought in, and nothing more to be
        done in a way of grace, the first resurrection from the dead will
        follow, and happy is he that will have part in it.

      For if the firstfruit be holy,.... Some by "the firstfruit" and "root"
      understand Christ, who is sometimes called, "the firstfruits of them that
      slept", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020">Co1 15:20</a>, and "the
      root of Jesse and David",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#010">Isa 11:10</a>, and indeed of all
      the righteous; and certain it is, that since he is holy, has all the
      holiness of his people in him, and is sanctification unto them, they shall
      be holy likewise; have it imparted to them in this life, and perfected in
      them in another: but this does not seem to agree with the apostle's
      argument. Others think that by them are meant the Jewish ancestors, and
      particularly Abraham, and dream of a holiness derived from him to his
      natural seed; but if no such holiness was derived from him to his
      immediate offspring, Ishmael, it can hardly be thought any should be
      communicated by him to his remote posterity; and to these here designed,
      at the distance of four or five thousand years from him: but by them are
      intended the first converts among the Jews, under the Gospel dispensation;
      it being usual with the apostle to call those persons, that were first
      converted in any place, the firstfruits of it; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom 16:5</a>; These were they
      who received the firstfruits of the Spirit in Judea, and who first among
      the Jews hoped and believed in Christ; these were but few in number, as
      the "firstfruit" is but small in comparison of "the lump", and mean,
      abject, and despicable, as the "root" under, and in a dry ground is; but
      yet were pledges and presages of a larger number of souls among that
      people, to be converted in the latter day: now the apostle's argument is,
      "if the firstfruit be holy",
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the lump is also holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches;
        that is, that whereas those persons who were converted among the Jews,
        however few in number, and despicable in appearance they might be, yet
        were truly sanctified by the Spirit of God; and as they were, so should
        the whole body of that people be in the last days, "when holiness shall
        be upon the horses' bells, and every pot in Judah and Jerusalem shall be
        holiness unto the Lord of hosts",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#020">Zac 14:20</a>, by which
        metaphorical expressions is meant, that holiness should be common to the
        whole nation, and all the inhabitants of it, of which the call of some
        few among them was a pledge and presage. The allusion in the former
        clause is to the holy offerings of firstfruits to the Lord, the two wave
        loaves, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#014">Lev 23:14</a>, whereby
        the whole lump was sanctified, for after use throughout the year
        following; and that in the latter clause, to the holiness of trees; that
        is, to trees devoted to sacred use or that were planted in a field
        appropriated thereunto: hence we read (t), that the men of Jericho
        permitted, or as other exemplars read it, cut down , "branches of
        holiness", or "holy branches"; and eat fallen fruit on the sabbath day.
        (u) Bartenora explains these branches, of such that grow upon a tree
        devoted to holy uses; and Maimonides (w), observes, that they thought it
        lawful to eat what grew in a holy field.

      And if some of the branches be broken,.... This is to be understood, not
      of the exclusion of the Jews from their national church; for the persons
      designed by the "branches", were the principal members of it, as the civil
      and ecclesiastical rulers, the priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, and the
      far greater part of the people; and on the other hand, the apostles and
      followers of Christ were put out of their synagogues, and deemed by them
      heretics and apostates: nor of the destruction of the Jewish nation, city,
      and temple; for as yet they existed as a nation, their city of Jerusalem
      was in being, and their temple standing: but of their being left out of
      the Gospel church, gathered among them, they not believing in the Messiah,
      but rejected and crucified him; and though afterwards the Gospel was
      preached to them, they despise it, contradicted, and blasphemed it; so
      that it pleased God to take it wholly away from them, when they might be
      truly said to be, "as branches broken off"; which phrase seems to be
      borrowed from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016">Jer 11:16</a>;
      they were withered, lifeless, and hopeless, being cast off by God, and
      neglected by his ministers, the Gospel being removed from them, and they
      without the means of grace and salvation: and this was the case of the
      generality of the people; for though the apostle only says "some", making
      the best of it in their favour against the Gentiles, and speaking in the
      softest terms; yet they were only a few, a seed, a remnant, that were
      taken into the Gospel church, and the rest were blinded, hardened,
      rejected, and left out for their unbelief:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and thou being a wild olive tree: speaking to the Gentiles, to some, not
        to all of them; for not a whole tree, but a part of one, what is cut out
        of it, a scion from it is grafted into another; and so they were a
        certain number which God took out from among the Gentiles, to be a
        people for his name and glory, and who before conversion were comparable
        to a wild olive tree; for though they might have some show of morality,
        religion, and worship, yet lived in gross ignorance, superstition,
        idolatry, and profaneness were destitute of a divine revelation, of all
        spiritual light and knowledge, of true righteousness and the grace of
        God; were barren and unfruitful in good works, were without hope, God
        and Christ in the world. This metaphor rather regards their character,
        case, and manners, than their original; in respect of which they and the
        Jews were on a level, being by nature equally corrupt, and children of
        wrath; and yet though a wild olive tree, were
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        grafted amongst them; meaning either the broken branches, in whose stead
        they were grafted; the Syriac version favours this sense, reading it "in
        their place"; as also in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#019">Rom 11:19</a>; and so the
        Ethiopic version: or rather the believing Jews, of whom the first Gospel
        church and churches consisted; for the Jews first trusted in Christ,
        received the firstfruits of the Spirit, and were first incorporated into
        a Gospel church state; and then the Gentiles which believed were
        received among them. The first coalition of Jews and Gentiles, or the
        ingrafting of the Gentiles in among the Jews that believed, was at
        Antioch, when dropping their distinctive names of Jews and Gentiles,
        they took the common name of Christians,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#019">Act 11:19</a>. So that this is
        not to be understood of an ingrafting into Christ unless by a visible
        profession, but of being received into a Gospel church state; which is
        signified by the "olive tree" in the next clause:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; the
        Gospel church is so called for its excellency the olive tree being a
        choice tree, as they were a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a
        holy nation, a peculiar people; for its fruitfulness, bringing forth
        berries that are wholesome, delightful, and useful, so the saints are
        filled with the fruits of grace, and good works, which are by Christ to
        the praise and glory of God; for its beauty when laden with fruit, so a
        Gospel church is beautiful maintaining the purity of Gospel doctrine,
        discipline, worship and conversation; "his beauty shall be as the olive
        tree", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006">Hos 14:6</a>; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#016">Jer 11:16</a>; and for its
        verdure and durableness, and growing on the mountains, all which may
        denote the continuance and firmness of the church of Christ. Now the
        Gentiles being grafted into a Gospel church state with the believing
        Jews, partook of the same root and fatness as they did, being built upon
        the same "foundation of the apostles prophets",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#020">Eph 2:20</a>; rooted,
        grounded, and built up in the same church state they enjoyed the same
        privileges, had the doctrines of Christ and his apostles preached to
        them, communicated with them in the ordinances of the Gospel, and were
        satisfied with the goodness and fatness of the house of God; for they
        became "fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise
        in Christ by the Gospel",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006">Eph 3:6</a>, the apostle
        speaks according to the nature of the olive tree, which is unctuous,
        from whence an oil is taken, which makes the face of man to shine, the
        fruit of which fattens those that are lean; and hence it loses not its
        leaves, , "because of its heat and fatness", as Plutarch (x) says.

      Boast not against the branches,.... Those that were broken off: the
      apostle would not have them vaunt it over them, despise them, and trample
      upon them; but pity them, and pray for and be abundantly thankful and
      humbled before God, under a sense of Ida sovereign and distinguishing
      grace, who had settled them in a Gospel church state, who were before
      comparable to a wild olive tree; and much less should they glory over the
      believing Jews, among whom they were, there being no difference between
      them, for they were all one in Christ Jesus:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but if thou boast; but if such a vain temper of mind should prevail, he
        suggests they would do well to sit down and consider what little reason
        they had on their side to glory; and if such glorying and boasting, one
        against another was lawful, the Jews had the greatest reason for it;
        for, adds the apostle,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. The Jews received no
        advantages from the Gentiles, but on the contrary the Gentiles from the
        Jews, to whom were committed the oracles of God, and by whom they were
        faithfully kept and transmitted to the Gentiles; the Gospel itself came
        out first from among them; the first preachers of it were Jews, who
        carried it into the Gentile world, where it was greatly succeeded to the
        conversion of many, who by this means were brought into a Gospel church
        state, and so enjoyed all the privileges they did: yea, Christ himself,
        according to the flesh, came of them, was sent unto them, was the
        minister of them, lived and died among them, and wrought out the great
        salvation for his people; hence "salvation" itself is said to be "of the
        Jews", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022">Joh 4:22</a>, so that
        the root and foundation of all their enjoyments were from the Jews, and
        not those of the Jews from them; hence there was no room, nor reason,
        for boasting against them, and vaunting it over them.

      </p>
      Thou wilt say then,.... This is an objection which the apostle foresaw the
      Gentiles would make against what he had said, and in favour of their
      boasting;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. The sense of
        which is, that the Jews were rejected and left out of the Gospel church,
        on purpose to make way for the Gentiles, that they might be put in their
        room; and consequently the Jews must be more vile and unworthy, and the
        Gentiles more deserving of such favours and privileges, or God would
        never have taken such a step, to leave out one to make room for the
        other.

      </p>
      Well,.... To this the apostle answers, by approving and granting in, part
      what was said, that the unbelieving Jews were broken off and rejected, and
      that the Gentiles that believed in Christ were grafted in among the Jews
      that professed his name; but then he tacitly denies that it was for their
      sakes, and their account, they were broken off, but for their own
      incredulity:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        because of unbelief they were broken off; because of their unbelief and
        contempt of the Messiah, they were rejected of God, and died in their
        sins; that which excluded their forefathers from the land of Canaan,
        shut them out of the Gospel church state, and the kingdom of heaven:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and thou standest by faith; which is not of a man's self, but the gift
        of God; so that it was not by their merits, and better deservings, but
        by the grace of God that they were in the situation they were; they were
        blessed with faith in Christ, and having made a profession of it were
        admitted to Gospel ordinances, and into a Gospel church; and being
        helped hitherto to hold the profession of their faith in a becoming
        manner they stood their ground, and continued in their church relation;
        and therefore ought not to give way to a vain boasting spirit, but to be
        humble, modest, and dependent; wherefore he gives them this proper
        pertinent, and wholesome advice,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        be not highminded, but fear. The apostle would have them not be elated
        with their gifts, privileges, and enjoyments, and look over others, or
        down upon them with contempt and disdain, considering that all they had
        and enjoyed were owing to the goodness of God, and not to any deserts of
        theirs; and therefore should fear the Lord and his goodness; for not a
        fear of hell and damnation, or a distrust of the grace of God, is here
        meant; but a fear of offending him, and that not from a dread of
        punishment, but from a sense of his grace and goodness; and also designs
        humility of soul, in opposition to pride, haughtiness, and elation of
        mind, a lowly carriage and behaviour to others, and an humble dependence
        on grace and strength from above, to enable to persevere and hold out to
        the end; for "let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall" into
        sin,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#012">Co1 10:12</a>; so as to
        dishonour God and Christ grieve the Holy Spirit, wound his own
        conscience, and bring himself under the censure of the church, and to be
        cut off from the good olive tree, the root and fatness of which he now
        partakes.

      </p>
      For if God spared not the natural branches,.... That is, executed his
      righteous judgments, inflicted due punishment upon the Jews, unchurched
      them, and stripped them of those privileges they enjoyed in a church
      state; who were the natural descendants of Abraham; were naturally, and as
      born into the world, in a national church state and in that national
      covenant God made with that people; to whom belonged a national adoption,
      in which sense they were the sons of God, his firstborn; they were chosen
      by him as a special and peculiar people, to very great favours and
      privileges; they were Christ's own, he came of them according to the
      flesh, and was particularly sent unto them, and ministered among them;
      wherefore, if, at last, God did not spare this people, though he had for a
      long time done it, but stirred up all his wrath against them, they
      disbelieving his Son, rejecting and despising the Messiah, and salvation
      by him, this should awaken the fear, care, and caution of the Gentiles in
      a church state, lest if they behave not well, he should deal in like
      manner with them:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        take heed lest he also spare not thee; for whatever was done to the Jews
        in former or latter times, are written for the instruction and
        admonition of Gentiles; and the use they are to make thereof is, to be
        careful and cautious, lest by imbibing principles derogatory from the
        grace of God and glory of Christ, or by an unbecoming walk and
        conversation they provoke the Lord to unchurch them as he has done the
        Jews before them; and which they may the rather fear, since the Jews
        were the natural branches, and they formerly strangers and aliens.

      Behold therefore the goodness, and severity of God,.... The consideration
      of both the grace and kindness of God to some, and his severity or strict
      justice towards others, is recommended by the apostle as very proper to
      abate pride, vain glory, and haughtiness of spirit; and to engage to
      humility, fear, care, and caution;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        on them which fell, severity: the Jews who stumbled at Christ and his
        Gospel, and fell by unbelief, God in strict justice and righteous
        judgment not only destroyed, as afterwards their nation, city, and
        temple, and scattered them abroad in the world to be a reproach, a
        proverb, a taunt, and a curse in all places; but cast them off as his
        people, broke his covenant with them, took away his Gospel from them,
        left them out of a Gospel church state, except a few, and gave up the
        generality of them to blindness and hardness of heart; so that wrath is
        come upon them to the uttermost, both with respect to things civil and
        religious, and they continue as living standing monuments of God's
        severity and justice, to be beheld by us Gentiles with pity and concern,
        and to excite in us the fear of God, and caution as to our conduct and
        behaviour in the world, and in the church:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but towards thee, goodness; the Gentiles, who not only share in the
        goodness and grace of God, displayed in the election of many of them to
        eternal life, in their redemption by Christ, and the effectual calling
        of them by the grace of God; but in their church state, they being made
        fellow citizens with the saints, fellow heirs, and of the same body, and
        having a place and a name in God's house, better than that of sons and
        daughters; and therefore under great obligation to fear the Lord, and
        his goodness, and to walk worthy of the calling wherein they are called,
        in all humility and lowliness of mind:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        if thou continue in his goodness; meaning not the love, grace, and free
        favour of God, or the grace of the Spirit, a continuance in which no
        "if" is to be put upon; for such who are interested in the love of God
        always continue in it, and nothing can separate them from it; and such
        as have the graces of the Spirit implanted in them, as faith, hope, and
        love, can never lose them; these always remain in them, and they in the
        possession of them, though not always in the exercise of them; but the
        goodness of God in a church state is here meant, as the means of grace
        and comfort, the ministration of the word and ordinances; and the sense
        is, if thou dost not despise the riches of divine goodness in a church
        relation, if thou dost not abuse it, or walk unworthy of it, if thou
        abidest by it, and retainest a value for it, thou wilt still share the
        advantages of it:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        otherwise thou also shall be cut off; from the good olive tree, the
        Gospel church state, into which the Gentiles were taken; and which, with
        respect to particular persons, may intend the act of excommunication by
        the church, expressed in Scripture by purging the old leaven, putting
        away the wicked person, withdrawing from such that are disorderly, and
        rejecting heretics, that is, from the communion of the church; and with
        respect to whole bodies and societies, an entire unchurching of them by
        removing the Gospel, and the ordinances of it; which threatening has
        been awfully fulfilled in many Gentile churches, in Asia, Africa, and
        Europe; and therefore may serve to awaken our fear, care, and caution,
        lest we should be treated in like manner.

      And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief,.... The apostle
      suggests that the Jews also might be recovered and brought into a Gospel
      church state, provided they did not continue in infidelity; but inasmuch
      as they seem to lie under invincible ignorance, obstinacy, and unbelief,
      and were such bitter enemies to the Gospel, and abhorrers of Gospel
      ordinances, and a Gospel church state; yea, that they must and will abide
      in unbelief, unless the Spirit of God convinces them of it, and it is
      given to them to believe in Christ, and they are powerfully drawn by the
      Father to come to the Son, there is no possibility or likelihood that they
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall be grafted in, or taken into a Gospel church state; to which the
        apostle answers, and argues for their ingrafting, and the possibility of
        it from the power of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for God is able to graft them in again; as many of them were in the
        times of the apostles, and some since, for nothing is impossible with
        God; he can remove their unbelief, knock off the shackles and fetters in
        which they are held, and bring, them out of the prison of infidelity, in
        which they are shut up; he is able to take away the blindness of their
        minds, and the hardness of their hearts, the veil that is over them, and
        turn them to the Lord; he can by his mighty power work faith in them,
        and cause them to look on him whom they have pierced, and mourn in an
        evangelical manner; he can bring them to Christ, and into his churches,
        and among his people, and fold them with the rest of his sheep; so that
        there one fold of Jew and Gentile, under one shepherd, Jesus Christ.

      For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree,.... As the apostle argues the
      possibility of bringing the Jews into a Gospel church state, from the
      power of God; so here the probability of it, or the easiness and
      likelihood of its being performed, from the ingrafting of the Gentiles;
      who were originally like an olive tree,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which is wild by nature, grows in the field, bears no fruit, and is
        useless and unprofitable; so they by nature were sinners of the
        Gentiles, children of wrath, full of unrighteousness, without any fruit
        of holiness; being not within the pale of the Jewish church and
        commonwealth; but in the wide field of the world, worthless, and of no
        account; and yet many were "cut out of" this wild olive tree; were,
        through the ministration of the Gospel, by the power of divine grace
        separated from the rest of the world; were effectually called and
        brought into a Gospel church state; God took out from among them a
        people for his name. This their being cut out of the wild olive, as it
        expresses the power and grace of God towards them, it might teach them
        humility, as it led them to observe their original state and condition:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and wert grafted, contrary to nature, into a good olive tree: for an
        olive tree being full of fatness, will not admit of ingrafting; nor was
        it ever usual to ingraft upon olive; hence the Jews say (y) , "there is
        no ingrafting on olives": besides, it is contrary to nature, use, and
        custom, to ingraft wild scions, or grafts of any sort into a good stock;
        but always good scions or grafts into a wild stock, for in wild hungry
        stocks, grafts grow best: but in the ingrafting of the Gentiles into a
        Gospel church state, just such a method was taken, as if a wild graft
        were let into a good stock; so that this ingrafting was not of nature,
        it was contrary to it; but of pure grace, and, sovereign good will and
        pleasure; and the apostle's argument is this, that if the Gentiles, who
        were originally as a wild olive tree; if some as grafts were taken out
        from among them, and, quite contrary to their own nature, and the nature
        of things, were, by the goodness and grace of God, grafted into a good
        olive, the Gospel church state;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        how much more shall these which be the natural branches, be grafted into
        their own olive tree? that there is a greater likelihood, and more
        easily may it be, according to all appearance of things, that the Jews,
        the natural branches or descendants of Abraham, should be brought into a
        Gospel church state, which first began among them, and which at first
        only consisted of some of their nation. The Gospel church is called
        "their own olive tree", in allusion to Israel, or the Jewish church,
        which is often so called in their writings.

        "Says (z) R. Joshua ben Levi, to what are the Israelites like? "to an
        olive tree"; to teach them that as the leaves of an olive tree do not
        fall, neither on sunshine days, nor on rainy days; so the Israelites
        will never cease, neither in this world, nor in the world to come; and
        says R. Jochanan, to what are the Israelites like? "to an olive"; to
        teach thee that as an olive does not send forth its oil, but by the
        means of pressing, so the Israelites do not return to do good, but by
        the means of chastisement:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and says another (a) of their writers,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "as oil ascendeth above all liquids, and is not mixed with them; so the
        Israelites ascend above all nations, and are not mixed with them; and
        there is an intimation that they are even like "to an olive", that is
        pressed or squeezed; for so the Israelites are bruised and afflicted,
        and yet, notwithstanding all this, they ascend by virtue of the law,
        which is called "oil olive".''

      <p>It is easy to see from whence this simile is borrowed.</p>
