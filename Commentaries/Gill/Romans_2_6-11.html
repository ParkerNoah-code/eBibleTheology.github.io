      Who will render to every man according to his deeds. God will be the
      Judge, who is righteous, holy, just, and true; every man in particular
      will be judged; as the judgment will be general to all, it will be special
      to everyone, and will proceed according to their works; for God will
      render to wicked men according to the demerit of their sins, the just
      recompense of reward, eternal damnation; and to good men eternal life, not
      according to the merit of their good works, which have none in them, but
      according to the nature of them; such who believe in Christ, and perform
      good works from a principle of grace, shall receive the reward of the
      inheritance, which is a reward of grace, and not of debt. In other words,
      God will render to evil men according to the true desert of their evil
      deeds; and of his own free grace will render to good men, whom he has made
      so by his grace, what is suitable and agreeable to those good works,
      which, by the assistance of his grace, they have been enabled to perform.

      To them who by patient continuance in well doing,.... These words are
      descriptive of one sort of persons, to whom God will render according to
      their works; and must be understood not of the Gentiles, the best and most
      moralized among them; for they sought after worldly things, after human
      wisdom, and popular applause, and not after God, his honour and glory, nor
      after immortality, which is only brought to light by the Gospel; nor of
      the pharisaical Jews, who sought for righteousness by the works of the
      law, and honour and glory from men, and not from God; nor of any
      unregenerate persons, but only of such who have the true principles of
      grace implanted in them, whether Jews or Gentiles: now the things which
      these men seek after are
      <p></p>
      <p>
        glory; not the glory of this world, nor any from the men of it; but the
        glory of God and Christ; to be glorious within and without, by the grace
        and righteousness of Christ here, and to enjoy eternal glory with him
        hereafter.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Honour; not that which Adam had in innocence, and did not abide in; but
        that which is, and abides with Christ, and which all the saints have,
        and shall have.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Immortality; not the immortality of the soul, which is common to all;
        but the incorruption of the body, or the glorious resurrection of it to
        everlasting life at the great day, or the incorruptible crown, and never
        fading inheritance of the saints in light. The manner in which these
        things are sought is, "by patient continuance in well doing"; by doing
        good works, and by doing these good works well, from a principle of
        faith and love, and with a view to the glory of God; and by patiently
        enduring reproaches and sufferings for well doing, and by persevering
        therein: not that these things are to be had, or are expected by the
        saints to be had for the sake of patience and well doing; yet they may
        be sought for, and looked unto, as an encouragement to well doing, and
        continuance therein; and though not "for", yet "in" well doing there is
        a reward. These words do not express that for the sake of which glory is
        had; but only describe the persons who seek, and the manner in which
        they seek for it, to whom God will render
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        eternal life, which he of his rich grace promised them before the world
        was, and of his free favour has put into the hands of Christ for them,
        and which, as a pure gift of grace, he bestows on them through him.

      But unto them that are contentious,.... This is a description of the other
      sort of persons to whom God will render according to their deeds, "who are
      of the contention"; who contend for victory, and not truth; strive about
      words to no profit; are quarrelsome, and sow discord among men, and in
      churches;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and do not obey the truth; neither attend to the light of nature, and to
        that which may be known of God by it; nor regard and submit to the
        Gospel revelation and so design both the Gentiles, which knew not God,
        and Jews, and others, who obey not the Gospel:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>but obey unrighteousness; are servants of sin: to these God renders</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        indignation and wrath; wrathful or fiery indignation, the hottest of his
        fury.

      Tribulation and anguish,.... These, with the foregoing words, are
      expressive of the second death, the torments of hell, the worm that never
      dies, and the fire that is not quenched: which will fall
      <p></p>
      <p>
        upon every soul of man that doth evil; whose course of life and
        conversation is evil; for "the soul that sins shall die" (Eze 18:4) unless
        satisfaction is made for his sins by the blood of Christ:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; regard being had to what
        nation they belong.

      But glory, honour, and peace,.... Which are so many words for the
      everlasting happiness of the saints; which is a "crown of glory that
      fadeth not away"
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#004">Pe1 5:4</a>); an honour
      exceeding that of the greatest potentates upon earth, since such that
      enjoy it will be kings and priests, and sit with Christ on his throne to
      all eternity; and is a peace that passes all understanding: all which will
      be rendered
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to every man that doth good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile;
        which none without Christ, and his grace, and by the strength of nature,
        does, or can do; not that good works are causes of salvation, but are
        testimonies of faith, and fruits of grace, with which salvation is
        connected, whether they be found in Jews or Gentiles; for neither grace
        nor salvation are peculiar to any nation, or set of people.

        For there is no respect of persons with God. It will not come into
        consideration, at the day of judgment, of what nation men are; or from
        what parents they are descended; nor of what age and sex persons be; nor
        in what state and condition they have lived in this world; nor will it
        be asked to what sect they have belonged, and by what denomination they
        have been called; or whether they have conformed to such and such
        externals and rituals in religion; but only whether they are righteous
        men or sinners; and accordingly as they appear under these characters,
        judgment will proceed. Some object from hence, though without any
        reason, to the doctrine of particular election of certain persons to
        everlasting salvation. This passage respects matters of strict justice,
        and is a forensic expression relating to courts of judicature, where
        persons presiding are to have no regard to the faces of men, but do that
        which is strictly just between man and man; and does not respect matters
        of grace and free favour, such as giving alms, forgiving debts, &amp;c.
        A judge, as such, is to regard no man's person, but to proceed in
        matters before him, according to the rules of law and justice; should he
        do otherwise, he would be chargeable with being a respecter of persons;
        but then he may bestow alms on what objects he pleases; and forgive one
        man who is personally indebted to him, and not another, without any such
        imputation. This, applied to the case in hand, abundantly clears it; for
        though God, as a Judge, respects no man's person; yet in matters of
        grace he distinguishes one person from another, as it is plain he does
        by the bounties of his Providence. Besides, God is not bound to any
        person by any laws, but acts as a Sovereign; he is not moved by anything
        in the creature; as his choice is not confined to persons of any
        particular nation, family, sex, or condition, so neither does it proceed
        upon anything, or a foresight of anything in them, or done by them; and
        as there is no worthiness in them that are chosen, and saved above
        others, so no injury is done to the rest: add to all this, that those
        that are saved by virtue of electing grace, are saved in a way of
        righteousness agreeably to the holy law, and strict justice of God; so
        that no complaint can be made against the distinguishing methods of
        grace, upon the foot of strict justice.
