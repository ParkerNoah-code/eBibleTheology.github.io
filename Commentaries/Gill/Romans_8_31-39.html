      What shall we then say to these things? &amp;c. Either to these
      afflictions, shall we murmur and repine at them? no, since they work
      together for our good, and are not to be compared with our future glory,
      which is certain; for if we suffer with, and for Christ, we shall be
      glorified together: or to these blessings just now mentioned, as the
      foreknowledge of God, divine predestination, effectual calling, free
      justification, and eternal glorification, what can be said to these?
      nothing can be added to them, they are a complete set of blessings,
      wanting nothing; nor can the greatness of them be fully expressed, or the
      freeness of God's grace displayed in them, sufficiently declared: what
      remains for us to do, but to be thankful for them, and glory in them? or
      what can be said "against" them? nothing at all, they cannot be
      contradicted or gainsaid; they are true and faithful sayings; they can
      never be made void, and of no effect, by hell or earth; nor ought our
      unbelieving hearts to have anything to say against interest in them: or
      what is to be said, or inferred "from" them? why, the free, sovereign,
      unchangeable, and everlasting love of God, in providing and bestowing such
      benefits; and the certainty of salvation, which is infallibly secured
      hereby:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        if God be for us; or, "seeing he is for us", has an affection for us,
        which appears from the gift of himself, Son, and Spirit, and all the
        blessings of grace and glory; and is on our side: as that he is on the
        side of his people, is evident from his preservation of them from the
        evils of the world and their own corruptions; from the supports he gives
        them under afflictions and temptations; from his carrying on the work of
        grace upon them, notwithstanding all the opposition made unto it; and
        from their safety and security they enjoy by him, notwithstanding the
        power of their enemies; he is so for them, and on their side, as that he
        will certainly save them. This he has determined to do, he has sent his
        Son to obtain salvation for them, his Spirit to apply it to them, and
        keeps them by his power to the full enjoyment of it: and since this is
        the case,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who can be against us? none can be against them. There are some that
        cannot possibly be against them; if Jehovah the Father is not against
        them, the Son cannot be against them, nor the Spirit; good angels cannot
        be against them, so far from it, that they rejoice at their good,
        minister to them, and are a guard about them; the law cannot be against
        them, because it is fulfilled in them; nor justice, because it is
        satisfied, and all its demands answered: and though there may be some
        who may be against them, and oppose themselves to them, yet their
        opposition is to no purpose; they will never prevail over them to their
        ruin and destruction; as neither sin, nor Satan, nor the world, nor
        death itself.

      He that spared not his own Son,.... It is said that God spared not the
      angels that sinned, nor the old world, which was full of violence, nor
      Sodom and Gomorrah, whose wickedness was great, nor the Egyptians and
      their firstborn, refusing to let Israel go, nor the Israelites themselves,
      when they transgressed his laws, nor wicked men hardened in sin; all which
      is not to be wondered at; but that he should not spare "his own Son", his
      proper Son, of the same nature with him, and equal to him, the Son of his
      love, and who never sinned against him, is very amazing: he spares many of
      the sons of men in a providential way, and in a way of grace, but he did
      not spare his own Son, or abate him anything in any respect, what was
      agreed upon between them, with regard to the salvation of his people; as
      appears by his assuming human nature, with all its weaknesses and
      infirmities; by his having laid on him all the iniquities of his people,
      and all the punishment due unto them he inflicted on him, without the
      least abatement; and by his sufferings not being deferred at all, beyond
      the appointed time; when full satisfaction for all their sins were
      demanded, the whole payment of their debts to the uttermost farthing
      insisted on, and all done according to the utmost strictness of divine
      justice: and which was not out of any disaffection to him; nor because he
      himself deserved such treatment; but because of the counsel, purpose, and
      promise of God, that his law and justice might be fully satisfied, and his
      people completely saved: moreover, the sense of the phrase may be learnt
      from the use of it in the Septuagint version of
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#012">Gen 22:12</a>, "thou hast not
      withheld thy Son, thine only Son from me", which that renders , "thou hast
      not spared thy beloved Son for me": so God did not spare his Son, because
      he did not withhold him:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but delivered him up for us all. That is, God the Father delivered him,
        according to his determinate counsel and foreknowledge, into the hands
        of wicked men; into the hands of justice, and to death itself; not for
        all men, for to all men he does not give Christ, and all things freely
        with him, nor are all delivered from condemnation and death by him;
        wherefore if he was delivered up for all men, he must be delivered up in
        vain for some; but for "us all", or "all us", whom he foreknew,
        predestinated, called, justified, and glorified; and not merely as a
        martyr, or by way of example only, and for their good, but as their
        surety and substitute, in their room and stead: wherefore
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        how shall he not with him freely give us all things? Christ is God's
        free gift to his elect; he is given to be a covenant to them, an head
        over them, a Saviour of them, and as the bread of life for them to live
        upon: he is freely given; God could never have been compelled to have
        given him; Christ could never have been merited by them; nothing that
        they could give or do could have laid him under obligation to have
        bestowed him on them; yea, such were the persons, and such their
        characters, for whom he delivered him up, that he might have justly
        stirred up all his wrath against them; and yet such was his grace, that
        he has given his own Son unto them; and not him alone, but "all things"
        with him: all temporal good things, needful and convenient; all
        spiritual blessings, a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin,
        sanctifying grace, adoption, and eternal life: and all "freely", in a
        sovereign way, according to his own good will and pleasure, without any
        obligation or compulsion; not grudgingly nor niggardly, but cheerfully
        and bountifully, absolutely, and without any conditions; for he is not
        moved thereunto by anything in them, or performed by them.

      Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?.... The elect of God
      are a certain select number of persons, whom he has so loved, as of his
      sovereign good will and pleasure, to choose in Christ before the
      foundation of the world, unto eternal life and salvation, by certain ways
      and means of his own appointing, as sanctification and faith, so that they
      are peculiarly his: but are these persons chargeable with nothing
      criminal? yes, with Adam's sin; with a want of original righteousness;
      with multitudes of sins before conversion, some of them with very great
      ones; and all, even after conversion, with frequent infirmities and
      backslidings: and will none rise up and exhibit charges of this nature
      against them? yes, even now, they very often bring charges against
      themselves; they are very apt to charge one another; Satan, the accuser of
      the brethren, lays many things to their charge very frequently, and so do
      the men of the world; but all these charges avail nothing, since none of
      the divine persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, lay anything against them:
      not God the Father, for
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it is God that justifieth; he against whom sin is committed, who is the
        lawgiver, and the righteous judge, justifies them from every charge; not
        by teaching them the way of justification, nor by infusing righteousness
        into them, or on account of any works of righteousness done by them, but
        by pronouncing them righteous through the imputation of the
        righteousness of his Son unto them: observe, that "God's elect", as
        such, are the objects of justification; which proves the eternity of it;
        the speciality of it as belonging to particular persons, and the
        everlasting security and continuance of it.

      Who is he that condemneth,.... That is, the elect of God: all mankind are
      deserving of condemnation, and are under the sentence of it, as in Adam;
      some are foreordained to condemnation; all in final impenitence and
      unbelief, are condemned already; and the whole world of the ungodly will
      be condemned at the last day; but none of God's elect are, or shall be
      condemned: for they are loved with an everlasting love; they are chosen
      unto salvation; they are in Christ, where there is no condemnation; they
      are brought to believe in him, and by him are justified from all sin, and
      so are secure from condemnation. They are indeed deserving of it as
      others, considered in themselves; and are under the sentence of it, as in
      Adam, with the rest of mankind; and in their own apprehensions, when
      convinced of sin, righteousness, and judgment. And are there none that
      will condemn them? yes, their own hearts often condemn them; they are very
      forward to condemn one another; the world condemns them, and so does the
      god of it: but neither Father, Son, nor Spirit, will condemn them; not the
      Father, for he justifies; nor the Son, for
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it is Christ that died: that he died is certain; the death he died was
        the death of the cross; the persons he died for were God's elect; the
        reason of his dying for them was to make atonement for their sins; this
        came to pass through his substitution in their room and stead; this
        death of his was but once, yet of an eternal efficacy, and so a full
        security of them from all condemnation: for sin, the cause of
        condemnation, was removed by it; the condemnation itself was bore by
        Christ in their stead; the law and justice of God were satisfied by it;
        pardon of sin was procured by his blood; and complete justification
        obtained by his active and passive obedience; all which is confirmed by
        his resurrection, session at God's right hand, and intercession:
        wherefore it is added,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        yea, rather that is risen again. As the death, so the resurrection of
        Christ, is the security of God's elect from condemnation; inasmuch as
        Christ rose again, as a conqueror over death, and over sin, the sting of
        death, and over Satan, who had the power of death; and also as a surety,
        having given satisfaction to law and justice: he engaged as a surety for
        his people; God in justice, and according to his righteous law, dealt
        with him, and by him as such; he satisfied both, and therefore was set
        free by them; hence neither law nor justice can condemn; besides he rose
        again as a common person, head and representative of his people, and for
        their justification: he first stood charged with all their sins, which
        by his Father, and with his own consent, were imputed to him; he was
        condemned and suffered death for them; when he rose from the dead, he
        was justified and acquitted from them all; and all his people were
        justified in him, and with him: yea, the resurrection of Christ is
        rather a greater security from condemnation, than his death; Christ's
        death expiated sin, but his resurrection brought in the everlasting
        righteousness; notwithstanding Christ's death, had he not risen again,
        we should have been in our sins, and so liable to condemnation; Christ's
        dying showed that he was arrested and condemned, but his resurrection
        shows that he is discharged, and we in him:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who is even at the right hand of God. The ascension of Christ, his
        entrance into heaven, and session at the right hand of God, are also a
        very considerable security of God's elect from condemnation; for when he
        ascended from earth to heaven in human nature, accompanied by angels, of
        which they and his disciples were witnesses, he led captivity captive,
        or triumphed over those that led his people captive, as sin, Satan, the
        law, death, and every other enemy of theirs; he entered into heaven to
        prepare it for them, to take possession of it in their name, to appear
        in the presence of God for them, and as having obtained the eternal
        redemption of them, where he was received with a welcome, as the surety
        and head of the chosen ones, and then sat down at the right hand of God;
        which shows that he had done his work, and to satisfaction, is advanced
        above all, power is given to him, all things are put under him, and he
        is head over all things to the church: and since he is at the right hand
        of God, as an advocate and intercessor for his people, it will be to no
        purpose, and of no avail, that Satan, or any other enemy, is at their
        right hand to resist them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who also maketh intercession for us; which is done, not by vocal prayer,
        as in the days of his flesh on earth; or as supplicating an angry judge;
        or as controverting: a point in the court of heaven; but by the
        appearance of his person for us, by the presentation of his sacrifice,
        by offering up the prayers and praises of his people, by declaring it as
        his will, that such and such blessings be bestowed upon them, and by
        seeing to it, that the benefits of his death are applied to those, for
        whom they were designed; which intercession of Christ proceeds upon the
        foot of a satisfaction made; it always continues, and is ever prevalent,
        and so has a considerable influence to secure from condemnation. The
        apostle, in this verse, seems to have in view a passage in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#029">Job 34:29</a>; which the
        Septuagint render, "and he gives peace, and who is he that condemneth?"

      Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?.... By "the love of Christ"
      is not meant the saints' love to Christ, but his love to them; he is
      indeed the object of their love, and so strong is their love to him, that
      it can never be destroyed; for though there may be an abatement in the
      fervour of it, it can never be lost; yet this is never called the love of
      Christ: besides, the apostle is speaking not of their love to Christ, but
      of the love of God and Christ to them, throughout the context; and his
      design is, to strengthen the faith of God's people, and comfort their
      souls, under their various afflictions: now nothing more effectually
      serves such purposes, than the love of Christ; and the things here
      instanced in are such, as are apt to inject doubts and fears, about
      interest in the love of Christ, and of the love of God in Christ, as it is
      interpreted in some following verses: moreover, the separation here
      interrogated is not of Christ from us, but of us from him; whereas was it
      our love to Christ, which is here meant, it should rather have been put,
      who shall separate him from us, and not us from the love of Christ? That
      Christ does love the elect of God, who are the persons here spoken of, is
      evident from his undertaking for them, espousing their persons, assuming
      their nature, dying in their room and stead, paying off their debts, and
      redeeming their persons, by going to prepare a place for them, by
      interceding for them, by supplying them with all grace, and using them in
      the most free and familiar manner; which love of his is wonderful,
      matchless, and inconceivable, special and peculiar, free and undeserved,
      exceeding affectionate, unchangeable, durable, and for ever. This is the
      bond of union to Christ; and the union which is made by it is exceeding
      near and close; it is real; perfect, and indissoluble, nothing can
      separate from it: not
      <p></p>
      <p>
        tribulation; or "affliction", which springs from his love, and is the
        fruit of it; and notwithstanding that, he rests in his love; this is not
        taken away, but is often sensibly enjoyed, in the midst of afflictions:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or distress; whether of body or mind; straitness in the affairs and
        circumstances of life, or straitness of mind, in the exercise of grace,
        and discharge of duty; for "though we believe not, yet he abides
        faithful" (Ti2 2:13) to his covenant
        and promises:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or persecution: from the world; for this is rather an evidence that
        Christ has loved them chosen and called them, because the world hates
        them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or famine: want of the necessaries of life, as food and drink; being
        exposed to great hunger and thirst, which has sometimes been the lot of
        the dear children of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or nakedness; want of proper clothing, or the use of common apparel;
        wandering about in sheep skins and goat skins, which has been the case
        of some, of whom the world was not worthy, and so no proof of separation
        from the love of Christ:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or peril; dangers from different quarters, by different persons and
        ways; such as the Apostle Paul had trial of, who was highly in the love
        of Christ,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#026">Co1 11:26</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or sword; that is, death by the sword; which death James the brother of
        John died (Act 12:13) now,
        though this may separate the head from the body, and separate soul and
        body, yet cannot separate from the love of Christ.

      As it is written, for thy sake we are killed,.... This passage is a
      citation out of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022">Psa 44:22</a>;
      and the meaning is, that for the sake of God, and his pure worship, Old
      Testament saints were frequently put to death, or exposed to the
      persecutions of men, which often issued in death; as New Testament saints
      have been, for the sake of Christ and his Gospel, even
      <p></p>
      <p>
        all the day long; that is, they were liable to death all the day long;
        or every day, one or other of them was put to death:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter; they were reckoned as fit
        for nothing else, and were continually exposed unto it; were used as
        sheep are, as if they were made for no other use and service, but to be
        slaughtered; hence they are called, "the flock of slaughter",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#007">Zac 11:7</a>; and as this
        expresses the brutality of their persecutors, so their harmlessness,
        meekness, humility, and patience in sufferings, being under them like
        lambs or sheep. This testimony is produced, to show that suffering death
        has been the common lot of the saints in all ages: and is designed to
        animate the people of God under the Gospel dispensation, to suffer with
        cheerfulness; the allusion may be to the lambs and sheep daily slain for
        sacrifice; either to the lambs of the sacrifice slain morning and
        evening; or to others that were slain in any part of the day from
        morning to night, for other sacrifices, in the court of the tabernacle
        and temple.

      Nay, in all these things,.... The former words being inserted in a
      parenthesis, these are an answer to the question in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#035">Rom 8:35</a>, "what shall
      separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation?" &amp;c. "nay", it
      shall not, nor any of the other things mentioned: "in all these things";
      afflictions, distresses, persecutions, famine, nakedness, sword, or any
      other thing of the same kind:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        we are more than conquerors; not only over sin and Satan, but the world,
        the reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions of it; which they
        cheerfully and courageously undergo, insomuch that they are not only
        conquerors, but "more than conquerors": they have above overcome, they
        have exceedingly the better of it; for they not only patiently bear
        afflictions and persecutions, but they glory in them; their experience,
        faith, and joy, are often increased by them; they have sometime
        solicited, and even wearied their persecutors; they have got the victory
        with ease, over Satan and his hellish emissaries, by the blood of the
        Lamb, and the word of their testimony: but this is not owing to
        themselves, or through their own strength, but
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through him that loved us; meaning either God the Father, whose love is
        mentioned in the following verses, or rather the Lord Jesus Christ; and
        so some copies express it, "through Christ that loved us": "through
        him", who has got the victory over all his and his people's enemies, and
        makes them sharers in his conquests; "through him", who is able to help
        them, and has strength sufficient to carry them through, and brings them
        off more than conquerors; who has loved them, still loves them, and
        whose love engages his power to stand by them and protect them against
        all their enemies.

      For I am persuaded,.... These words with the following, express the strong
      persuasion, and full assurance of faith the apostle had, that nothing
      whatever could separate him and the rest of God's people, from his love
      towards them in Christ Jesus. This persuasion not only regards himself,
      but others; and is not conjectural, but certain; and which did not arise
      from any special and extraordinary revelation, but is founded upon the
      nature of the love of God itself, the security of it in Christ, and of the
      persons of God's elect in him; upon eternal predestination, and the
      unalterable purposes of God; upon the promise and oath of God; upon
      adoption, and the gracious witnessings, assistances, and inhabitation of
      the Spirit; and is greatly increased by the consideration of the death,
      resurrection, and intercession of Christ. The things enumerated, which are
      not able to separate from the love of God, are as follow:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        death; death separates men from the world, their worldly habitations and
        substance; it separates the soul from the body, and one friend from
        another; and in process of time, may take off all thoughts and
        affections for departed friends, but it is not able to separate from the
        love of God; it is so far from it, that it lets the soul into the
        fullest enjoyment of it: and as corporeal death, so no other kind of
        death can do it; for if the death of the body cannot, the death of
        afflictions never can; and as for a moral or spiritual death, and an
        eternal one, these shall never befall the children of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor life; this natural and temporal life, which is frail and mortal; the
        love of God is better than this life, and this itself is the effect of
        divine favour; wherefore this can never separate from the love of God,
        nor anything in it: the life of believers is indeed filled up with
        troubles and exercises, and attended with much imperfection and sin; but
        nothing does, or can alienate the affections of God from his children;
        for though he exercises them with the trials of life, and chastises them
        for their sins, yet his loving kindness be does not take away from them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor angels; by whom are meant evil angels, the devils; for as for good
        angels, they never attempt to separate God and his people; they rejoice
        at their good, minister to them, are their guardians whilst here, at
        death they carry their souls to heaven, and at the last day will gather
        all the elect together; but evil angels do endeavour it, by temptations
        to sin, and accusations for it; by stirring up heresies and
        persecutions, in order to destroy them, but cannot succeed; for the
        saints are upon God's heart, are in Christ's hands, and on him the rock;
        and the Spirit of God is in them, who is greater than he that is in the
        world:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor principalities: civil magistrates; who though they may separate them
        from their company, and cast them out as evil; may separate them in
        prisons one from another; and separate soul and body, by killing the
        latter, which is all they can do; yet they cannot separate neither soul
        nor body from the love of God: the Jews often say, that if all the
        nations of the world were gathered together, they could not extinguish
        (n) or cause to cease (o), or take away the love which is between God
        and his people Israel (p):
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor powers; either the same with the former; or false teachers who had
        the power of working miracles in confirmation of their doctrines, by
        which they deceived many; and if it had been possible, would have
        deceived the elect of God, but that was impossible:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor things present; present evils, the afflictions of the present life;
        God does not cease to love when he afflicts his people; yea, afflictions
        spring from his love, and in them he afresh manifests his love to them;
        they are overruled for their good, and issue in eternal glory. Present
        temptations also may be meant. The best of saints have been exposed unto
        them; Christ himself was not exempted from them; these do not, nor
        cannot separate from the love of God; which is manifest from the regard
        which God and Christ have to tempted ones, by sympathizing with them,
        supporting and succouring of them, rebuking the tempter, and delivering
        from them. Present desertions, or the hidings of God's face, which often
        is the case of his dear children, can have no such effect; their
        relation to God still continues; they have great nearness unto him, are
        engraven on the palms of his hands, are set as a seal on his heart, and
        he bears a strong affection to them; though, for wise reasons, he is
        pleased for a moment to hide himself from them: yea, the present body of
        sin and death saints carry about with them in this life, cannot separate
        them; sin has separated the angels from God, who rebelled against him;
        it drove Adam out of the garden of Eden, and will exclude the wicked
        from the divine presence to all eternity; and it often separates between
        God and his own people, with respect to communion, but never with
        respect to union to him, or interest in him; for he knew what they would
        be when he set his love upon them; his love broke through all the
        corruptions of nature and sins of life in their conversion; and appears
        to continue the same from the strong expressions of his grace to them,
        notwithstanding all their backslidings; could sin separate in this
        sense, no one would remain the object of his love. Now this does not
        suppose that God loves sin, nor does it give any encouragement to it;
        for though it cannot separate from interest in God, yet it does from the
        enjoyment of him. Again, present good things may be designed, the good
        things of this life, temporal enjoyments; these are given in love; and
        though they may be but few, they are in mercy, and with a blessing; and
        the great mercy of all is, that these are not their all, nor do they
        take off their value and esteem for the love of God, which is better to
        them than all the things of life; and though "the prosperity of fools
        shall destroy them" (Pro 1:32) the prosperity
        of the saints shall never be their ruin:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor things to come; whether good or bad, prosperous or adverse; more
        afflictions, fresh difficulties with the body of sin; an hour of
        temptation, and time of distress that is to come upon all the earth; or
        the evil days of old age; God will never leave, nor forsake his people,
        or cause his loving kindness to depart from them, in whatsoever state or
        condition they may come into: the Vulgate Latin version adds, "nor
        fortitude"; and the Ethiopic version, "nor powers"; and one copy adds it
        in the beginning of
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#039">Rom 8:39</a>, "nor power".

      Nor height, nor depth,.... Neither heaven, earth, nor hell, nor any of the
      inhabitants of either, or anything in either; no high or low place, to be
      cast down from the one, or into the other; nor the height of honour and
      prosperity, or the depth of meanness and adversity; nor the height of
      power, or depth of policy in men or devils;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nor any other creature. This takes in the whole compass of created
        beings in heaven, earth, and sea; and most strongly expresses the
        inseparableness of the saints from the love of God, by anything or
        creature whatever; nothing in the whole universe
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall be able to separate us the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
        our Lord: by "the love of God", is not meant the saints' love to God;
        for though this is sometimes called the love of God, it is from him, as
        the author of it, and to him, as the object of it, and may be said to be
        in Christ, or by him, and can never be lost; yet the apostle would not
        have expressed such a strong confidence and full persuasion about this,
        and would rather have said, had this been his meaning, that nothing
        shall be able to separate our love from God, or God from our love, and
        not us from the love of God; besides, he is speaking of that love by
        which we are more than conquerors, and manifestly intends the love with
        which God loves his people, particularly the love of God the Father: and
        this is "in Christ Jesus our Lord"; he has expressed it in and through
        Christ, in choosing and blessing them in him, and in sending him to die
        for them; and it still continues in him, and is in him as their Lord,
        head, husband, and Redeemer; and is a reason why nothing can separate
        them from it: which is to be understood, not of the effects of love, and
        the application of it, which may be suspended for a time; nor of the
        manifestation and sense of it, which believers may be without for a
        while; nor of any sort of separation from God, for saints themselves may
        be separated from him, with respect to intimate sensible communion and
        fellowship; but the sense of this passage is, that they can never be
        separated from the love of God, so as that that union which is made by
        it between God and them can ever be dissolved, or they cease to have any
        share or interest in his love. This the apostle was persuaded could
        never be.
