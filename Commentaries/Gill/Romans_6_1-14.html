      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The Apostle having finished his design concerning the doctrine of
        justification, refutes the charge brought against it as a licentious
        doctrine, and prevents any ill use that might be made of it by men of
        evil minds, justified persons by the strongest arguments, and with the
        best of motives to holiness of life and conversation: he saw, that
        whereas he had affirmed in the preceding chapter, that sin being made to
        abound by the law, in the condemnation of sinners, the grace of God the
        more abounded in their justification and pardon; that some would rise up
        and object, that this doctrine countenances men's continuance in sin,
        and opens a door to all manner of iniquity; and that others would abuse
        this doctrine, and encourage themselves in a vicious course of life,
        upon this mistaken notion, that the grace of God would be the more
        illustrious by it; all which is suggested in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#001">Rom 6:1</a>, to which an
        answer is returned in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#002">Rom 6:2</a>, with an
        abhorrence of everything of this kind; and by an argument, showing the
        absurdity and inconsistency of it, seeing persons dead to sin, as
        justified ones are, cannot live in it: and that they are dead to sin,
        and under obligation to live unto righteousness, he argues from their
        baptism into Christ's death, which represents their being dead with
        Christ, and buried with him (Rom 6:3) and likewise the
        resurrection of Christ from the dead, and theirs by him, whereby they
        are both fitted and obliged to walk in newness of life; since they are,
        and should be like him, as in his death, so in his resurrection from the
        dead: and the rather, as they are implanted in him, as the branches in
        the vine (Rom 6:4) and
        especially as it was the great end of his death, that by the crucifixion
        of sin with him, it might so be destroyed, that his people should be no
        more servants to it (Rom 6:6) this being
        proved, that justified ones are dead to sin, the apostle argues upon it,
        that such are freed from sin (Rom 6:7) and therefore
        ought not, and cannot live in it; for this must be given into as an
        article of faith, that such as are dead with Christ live, and shall live
        a life of communion with him (Rom 6:8) which is
        inconsistent with living in sin: he further argues from the resurrection
        of Christ, which was not to die more (Rom 6:9) and suggests,
        that in like manner, those who have been dead and buried, and risen with
        him, which their baptism signifies, should not live in sin, which is no
        other than dying again; and to strengthen this, directs to the ends of
        Christ's death and resurrection (Rom 6:10) the end of the
        one being unto sin, to finish, make an end of that, and be the death of
        it, and the end of the other, being living unto God; wherefore in like
        manner, such who profess to be Christ's, to be justified by his
        righteousness, to be baptized into his death, and to be risen with him,
        should account themselves dead unto sin, and so not live in it, and
        alive to God through the righteousness of Christ, and so live to his
        honour and glory (Rom 6:11) and having thus
        answered the objection, and removed the calumny, and set this matter in
        a clear light, the apostle proceeds to dehort from sinning, and to
        exhort to holiness of life (Rom 6:12) in which he
        compares sin to a tyrant, the lusts of it to the laws of such an one,
        and which therefore should not be obeyed; and the rather, as the wages
        of them are death, and have made the body already mortal; wherefore the
        members of it should not be employed in such service, but in the service
        of God: and whereas it might be objected, that sin is too strong and
        prevalent, and has got the mastery, and will keep its power, the apostle
        declares it as a promise of grace, that sin shall not have the dominion (Rom 6:14) giving this as a
        reason, because such as are justified and sanctified, are not under the
        law, as a covenant of works, but under the covenant of grace, of which
        this promise is a part; and in order to prevent an ill use of this
        doctrine, and remove an objection that might be made, that if not under
        the law, men are under no restraints, but may go on in sin without
        control, he answers it with his usual detestation (Rom 6:15) and argues the
        folly and absurdity of living in sin upon such an account, because it
        would make them servants of sin unto death (Rom 6:16) and so they were
        before conversion, but now were otherwise, for, which they had reason to
        be thankful (Rom 6:17)
        since through the grace of God they had yielded an hearty obedience to
        the Gospel; wherefore to obey sin would be to return to their former
        state of bondage; whereas being freed from the power and dominion of
        sin, they were now the servants of righteousness, and ought to act
        becoming such a character (Rom 6:18) wherefore it was
        but acting the part of reasonable men, it was but their reasonable
        service, to yield themselves servants, not to sin and uncleanness, but
        to righteousness and holiness (Rom 6:19) in order to
        engage to which, the apostle puts them in mind of their former state;
        how that when they were in subjection to sin, they had nothing to do
        with the exercise of righteousness (Rom 6:20) and therefore as
        there was an alteration made in them, they ought to be just the reverse
        in their conduct and conversation; for he appeals to them, that they had
        no pleasure nor profit in their former course of life; which had brought
        upon them shame and confusion, and must have ended in death, had it not
        been for the grace of God (Rom 6:21) but now as they
        were delivered from the slavery and dominion of sin, they were under a
        better master, were servants to God; and the fruit of their service was
        holiness, and the issue of all would be everlasting life (Rom 6:22) which is
        illustrated by the contrary (Rom 6:23) the wages due
        from the service of sin, and which only could be expected from it, being
        death; whereas grace and holiness, the gift of God, issue in eternal
        life by Christ Jesus; in whose hands it is, and through whom it comes,
        and is enjoyed.

      What shall we say then?.... The apostle here obviates an objection he saw
      would be made against the doctrine he had advanced, concerning the
      aboundings of the grace of God in such persons and places, where sin had
      abounded; which if true, might some persons say, then it will be most fit
      and proper to continue in a sinful course of life, to give up ourselves to
      all manner of iniquity, since this is the way to make the grace of God
      abound yet more and more: now says the apostle, what shall we say to this?
      how shall we answer such an objection? shall we join with the objectors,
      and say as they do? and
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? that is, shall we
        persist in a vicious way of living with this view, that the grace of God
        may be magnified hereby? is it right to commit sin on such an account?
        or is this a fair inference, a just consequence, drawn from the doctrine
        of grace? To be sure it was not, the objection is without any ground and
        foundation; sin is not "per se", the cause of the glorifying God's
        grace, but "per accidens": sin of itself is the cause of wrath, and not
        of grace; but God has been pleased to take an occasion of magnifying his
        grace, in the forgiveness of sin: for it is not by the commission of
        sin, but by the pardon of it, that the grace of God is glorified, or
        made to abound. Moreover, grace in conversion is glorified by putting a
        stop to the reign of sin, and not by increasing its power, which would
        be done by continuing in it; grace teaches men not to live in sin, but
        to abstain from it; add to this, that it is owing to the want of grace,
        and not to the aboundings of it, that men at any time abuse, or make an
        ill use of the doctrines of grace; wherefore the apostle's answer is,
      </p>

      God forbid,.... By which he expresses his abhorrence of such a practice,
      and that this was a consequence which did not follow from the premises,
      and was far enough from his thoughts, and which he had in the greatest
      detestation: and he further argues against it by asking,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        how shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? There is a
        death for sin, a death in sin, and a death to sin; the latter is here
        mentioned, and persons may be said to be "dead to sin", both as
        justified and sanctified: justified persons are dead to sin, inasmuch as
        that is not imputed to them to condemnation and death; they are
        discharged from it; it cannot hurt them, or exert its damning power over
        them; it is crucified, abolished, and made an end of by Christ:
        sanctified persons are dead to sin; sin is not made their business, it
        is not their course of life; it is no longer a pleasure to them, but is
        loathsome and abominable; it is looked upon, not as a friend, but an
        enemy; it does not reign, it has not the dominion over them; it is
        subdued in them, and its power weakened; and as to the members of the
        flesh, and deeds of the body, it is mortified: to live in sin, is to
        live after the dictates of corrupt nature; and persons may be said to
        live in it, when they give up themselves to it, are bent upon it; when
        sin is their life, they delight in it, make it their work and business,
        and the whole course of their life is sinful: now those who are dead to
        sin, cannot thus live in it, though sin may live in them; they may fall
        into sin, and lie in it some time, yet they cannot live in it: living in
        sin, is not only unbecoming the grace of God revealed in the Gospel, but
        is contrary to it; it is detestable to gracious minds, yea, it seems
        impossible they should live in it; which is suggested by this question,
        "how shall we?" &amp;c. The thing is impracticable: for, for a gracious
        soul to live in sin, would be to die again, to become dead in sin, which
        cannot be; he that lives and believes in Christ shall never die,
        spiritually or eternally.

      Know ye not that so many of us as, You must know this, you cannot be
      ignorant of it, that whoever
      <p></p>
      <p>
        were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death: and
        therefore must be dead to sin, and consequently ought not to live, nor
        can they live in sin. This does not suppose, that some of this church
        were baptized persons, and others not; but that some might be baptized
        in water who were not baptized into Christ: there is a difference
        between being baptized in water in the name of Christ, and being
        baptized into Christ, which believers in their baptism are; by which is
        meant, not a being brought by it into union with Christ, which is either
        secretly from eternity, or openly at conversion, and both before the
        baptism of true believers; nor a being brought by it into the mystical
        body of Christ the church, for this also is before it; but rather it
        designs a being baptized, or a being brought by baptism into more
        communion with Christ, into a participation of his grace and benefits;
        or into the doctrine of Christ, and a more distinct knowledge of it: the
        power of which they feel upon their hearts, and so have really believed
        in Christ, heartily love him, and make a sincere profession of him;
        though rather the true meaning of the phrase "baptized into Christ", I
        take to be, is to be baptized purely for the sake of Christ, in
        imitation of him, who has set us an example, and because baptism is an
        ordinance of his; it is to submit to it with a view to his glory, to
        testify our affection for him, and subjection to him, without laying any
        stress or dependence on it for salvation; such who are thus baptized,
        are "baptized into his death"; they not only resemble Christ in his
        sufferings and death, by being immersed in water, but they declare their
        faith in the death of Christ, and also share in the benefits of his
        death; such as peace, pardon, righteousness, and atonement: now this
        proves, that such persons are dead to sin, who are so baptized; for by
        the death of Christ, into which they are baptized, they are justified
        from sin; by the death of Christ, their old man is crucified, and the
        body of sin destroyed; besides, believers in baptism profess themselves
        to be dead to sin and the world, and their baptism is an obligation upon
        them to live unto righteousness.

      Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death,.... The nature and
      end of baptism are here expressed; the nature of it, it is a "burial"; and
      when the apostle so calls it, he manifestly refers to the ancient and only
      way of administering this ordinance, by immersion; when a person is
      covered, and as it were buried in water, as a corpse is when laid the
      earth, and covered with it: and it is a burial with Christ; it is a
      representation of the burial of Christ, and of our burial with him as our
      head and representative, and that "into death"; meaning either the death
      of Christ as before, that is, so as to partake of the benefits of his
      death; or the death of sin, of which baptism is also a token; for
      believers, whilst under water, are as persons buried, and so dead; which
      signifies not only their being dead with Christ, and their communion with
      him in his death, but also their being dead to sin by the grace of Christ,
      and therefore ought not to live in it: for the apostle is still pursuing
      his argument, and is showing, from the nature, use, and end of baptism,
      that believers are dead to sin, and therefore cannot, and ought not, to
      live in it; as more fully appears from the end of baptism next mentioned;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
        father, even so we also should walk in newness of life; for the end of
        baptism is not only to represent the death and burial, but also the
        resurrection of Christ from the dead, which is here said to be "by the
        glory of the Father", some read the words, "unto the glory of the
        Father"; meaning either, that the Father might be glorified hereby; or
        that Christ, being raised from the dead, might enjoy glory with the
        Father, as he does in human nature; but rather the phrase expresses the
        means by which, and not the end to which, Christ was raised from the
        dead: and by the "glory of the Father" is meant, the glorious power of
        the Father, which was eminently displayed in raising Christ from the
        dead; and as baptism is designed to represent the resurrection of
        Christ, which is done by raising the person out of the water, so
        likewise to represent our resurrection from the death of sin, to a life
        of grace: whence it must be greatly incumbent on baptized believers, who
        are raised from the graves of sin by the power of Christ, to "walk in
        newness of life"; for since they are become new creatures, and have new
        hearts and new spirits given them, new principles of light, life, grace,
        and holiness implanted in them, and have entered into a new profession
        of religion, of which baptism is the badge and symbol, they ought to
        live a new life and conversation.

      For if we have been planted together,.... This is not to be understood of
      an implantation of Jews and Gentiles together in One body; nor of an
      implantation of believers together in a church state; but of an
      implantation of Christ and his people together; which is openly done at
      conversion, in consequence of a secret union with him before; when they
      are transplanted from a state of nature, and are ingrafted into Christ;
      have the graces of the Spirit of God implanted in them, and grow up under
      the dews of grace, and shinings of the sun of righteousness upon them, and
      bring forth much fruit; now as these persons, by virtue of their secret
      union with Christ from eternity, as their head and representative, with
      whom they were crucified, in whom they died representatively, share in his
      death, enjoy the benefits of it, and feel its efficacy, and through it
      become dead to the law, sin, and the world, which is meant by
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the likeness of his death; so these same persons shall be also planted
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in the likeness of his resurrection; that is, they shall share in the
        benefits, and feel and enjoy the effects of it; not only their bodies
        will be raised at the last day, as their souls are now regenerated by
        virtue of it, and in resemblance to it; but their are, and shall be so
        influenced by his Spirit and grace, which has raised them from death to
        life, that they shall walk in newness of life; of which baptism is a
        lively representation, and to which it is a constant obligation.

      Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him,.... By the old man
      is meant the corruption of nature; called a man, because natural to men;
      it lives and dwells in them; it has spread itself over the whole man; it
      rules and governs in men; and consists of various parts and members, as a
      man does: it is called "old", because it is the poison of the old serpent,
      with which man was infected by him from the beginning; it is derived from
      the first man that ever was; it is as old as the man is, in whom it is,
      and is likewise called so, with respect to its duration and continuance;
      and in opposition to, and contradistinction from, the new man, or
      principle of grace: it is called "ours", because continual to us; it is in
      our nature, it cleaves to us, and abides in us. This name the apostle took
      from his countrymen the Jews, who were wont to call the vitiosity of
      nature hereby; so R. Aba on that passage, "the firstborn said to the
      younger, our father is old" (Gen 19:31) asks, what is the
      meaning of this, "our father is old?" this, answers he, is the evil
      imagination, or corruption of nature, which is called "old", according to
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#013">Ecc 4:13</a>; and is said to be
      old, , "because it is born with the man" (o); or as the reason is
      elsewhere given (p), because it is joined to him from his birth, to his
      old age: this, they say (q), is with a man as soon as he is born, from the
      hour of his birth, as soon as ever he comes into the world. Now this is
      said to be "crucified with him"; that is, with Christ, when he was
      crucified: the Jews (r) have a notion that the evil imagination, or
      corruption of nature, , will not be made to cease, or be abolished out of
      the world, till the King Messiah comes, and by him it is abolished: this
      is so crucified by the death, and at the cross of Christ, as that it
      cannot exert its damning power over believers; and is so crucified by the
      Spirit and grace of Christ in them, as that it cannot reign over them, or
      exercise its domineering power over them; wherefore they are dead unto it,
      and that to them, and therefore cannot live in it; which is done,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that the body of sin might be destroyed: by "the body of sin" is meant
        sin itself, which consists, as a body does, of various members; and also
        the power and strength of it, which the Jews (s) call , "the power of
        the evil imagination"; this is crucified with Christ, and nailed to his
        cross by his sacrifice and satisfaction, that its damning power might be
        destroyed, abolished, and done away: and it is crucified by the Spirit
        and grace of Christ, that its governing power might be took away, and
        that itself be subdued, weakened, and laid under restraints, and its
        members and deeds mortified:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that henceforth we should not serve sin; not that it should not be in
        us, for as yet, neither by virtue of the sacrifice of Christ, nor by the
        power of his grace, is sin as to its being removed from the people of
        God: but that we should not serve it, make provision for it, indulge it
        and obey it, in the lusts thereof.

      For he that is dead, is freed from sin. This is not to be understood of a
      natural or a corporeal death; for this is the effect of sin, and is
      inflicted by way of punishment for it, on Christless persons; so far is it
      from being an atonement for sin, as the Jews (t) fancy; besides, there are
      many persons, who as they die in their sins, they will rise in them;
      though a natural death is alluded to, when persons are free from those
      laws and obligations to service and duty they are under whilst living: but
      here it is to be understood of a spiritual or mystical death, and of
      persons who are dead to the law, by the body of Christ; dead to sin by the
      sacrifice and grace of Christ; who are baptized into the death of Christ,
      and in imitation of him: such are "freed from sin"; not from the being of
      it; nor from the burden of it; nor from a continual war with it; nor from
      slips and falls into it; no, not even freed from it, in the most solemn
      services and acts of religion; but they are freed from the dominion of it,
      from servitude to it, and also from the guilt of it, and from obligation
      to punishment on account of it: they are, as it is in the Greek text, and
      as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions read, "justified from sin".

      Now if we be dead with Christ,.... This does not imply any doubt about it,
      but is rather a taking it for granted: seeing we are dead with Christ by
      union with him, as our head and representative, and by communion with him
      in the benefits of his death, and being planted together in the likeness
      of it; or being dead to the law, sin, and the world, through the virtue
      and efficacy of Christ's death:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        we believe that we shall also live with him; not only a life of
        justification by faith in his righteousness; and a life of
        sanctification from him, and to his glory; the continuance of which, and
        a perseverance in it, are firmly believed; but a life of glory and
        happiness with him hereafter, both in the new Jerusalem, in the new
        heavens, and new earth, in the glorious state of the church on earth,
        and in heaven to all eternity; where they shall be personally and
        visibly with him, in soul and body, and shall live in the most intimate
        and uninterrupted communion with him, enjoying the highest pleasure, and
        the most consummate happiness; and are therefore under the greatest
        obligation, whilst here on earth, to live, not in sin, but to
        righteousness, and to his praise and glory; with whom they are now dead
        to sin, and with whom they not only hope, but believe they shall live
        throughout the endless ages of eternity.

      Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead,.... That Christ is risen
      from the dead, is a certain fact, well attested, thoroughly known, and
      firmly believed; the prophets prophesied of it, Christ himself foretold
      it, angels affirmed it, and the apostles were witnesses of it, as is also
      the Holy Ghost: and it is as certain, that he
      <p></p>
      <p>
        dieth no more; he is raised to an immortal life, and will live for
        evermore; there is no need of his dying again, his death having been a
        full atonement and expiation of all the sins and transgressions of his
        people:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        death hath no more dominion over him: it once had dominion over him; it
        held him under its power for a time, according to the divine
        determination, and by his own consent: but it was not possible he should
        be holden of it longer; both on account of the dignity of his person, as
        the Son of God, and the virtue and efficacy of his sacrifice, as the
        surety of his people, having put away sin for ever by it. He is the holy
        man the Jews (u) speak of,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "who is the mystery of the name Jehovah, and in him there is no sin,
        neither shall death have the dominion over him.''

      For in that he died,.... The death of Christ was settled and agreed to in
      the covenant and council of peace; it was spoken of by the prophets, and
      typified by sacrifices; Christ came into the world in order to die, and
      actually did die the death of the cross; in which the great love of God
      and Christ is expressed to us; and which is a fundamental article of the
      Christian faith: and when he died,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he died unto sin once: he died to that, which we by nature are dead in,
        and could never make atonement for; which he himself never lived in, and
        which men naturally love to in; and which had he not died for, we must
        have died for to all eternity; and he died not for any sin of his own,
        or of angels, nor for the sins of every man, but for the sins of his
        people; it may be rendered, he died in sin: in the likeness of sinful
        flesh, in which he was sent; having as a surety sin laid on him, and
        bore by him, and for which he was wounded, bruised, and died: or rather
        to sin; that is, to make atonement for it, procure the pardon of it,
        take it away, and utterly abolish it: and this he did "once"; this is
        observed, in reference to the repeated sacrifices of the old law, which
        could never expiate or remove sin; and to show, that Christ's dying once
        was enough, his sacrifice was fully satisfactory to the law and justice
        of God:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but in that he liveth: which must be understood, not of his life as God,
        but as man; and that not on earth, but in heaven; where he lives with
        God, at the right hand of God, and by him, by the power of God: and
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>he liveth unto God; to his glory, and to make intercession for us.</p>

      Likewise reckon ye also yourselves,.... Two things the apostle would have
      believers consider of themselves, and reckon themselves, to be, in
      consequence of their relation to Christ, who was dead, but is alive, and
      as agreeable thereunto: the one is, that they would look upon themselves
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to be dead indeed unto sin: believe their discharge from it, and not
        fear condemnation and death on account of it; and that it shall not be
        imputed to them, or have any damning power over them, since Christ has
        died unto it, or for it; and therefore should have no fellowship with
        it, nothing to do with it, as being dead unto it, and that to them: the
        other is, that they would consider themselves
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        alive unto God, through, Jesus Christ our Lord; and that either in a
        legal sense, as justified persons; men in a state of nature, or of
        "Pharisaism", think themselves alive, when they are not; but when they
        come under a work of the Spirit of God, they see themselves otherwise,
        and are convinced both of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the
        insufficiency of their own righteousness to justify from it; and when
        they have the righteousness of Christ revealed unto them, and faith is
        wrought in them to look unto it, and lay hold upon it, they are in
        themselves, and in their own apprehensions, alive, and that "unto God",
        in the sight of God; and their life of faith on the righteousness of
        Christ, is unto the glory of God, and will be followed with an eternal
        life with God, to which the justifying righteousness of Christ gives
        them a title; and this is all through Christ, and his righteousness: or
        this is to be considered by them of themselves as sanctified persons,
        who are quickened by the Spirit of Christ, and can feel the burden of
        sin, see the corruption of their nature, hear the voice both of law and
        Gospel, breathe after spiritual things, speak the language of Canaan,
        walk by faith on Christ, and work and act for him; which life of faith
        and holiness is "unto God", to his glory and honour, and is "through
        Christ", and is maintained and supported by him: or they should consider
        themselves not only as being justified before God, and made alive by his
        Spirit, but as such who shall live to and with God, through Christ, for
        evermore; for as Christ died and rose again, and lives unto and with God
        for ever, so they being dead to sin through him, and being quickened
        together with him and by his Spirit, shall never die the second death,
        but shall have everlasting life.

      Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body,.... Since grace reigns in
      you, sin should not: seeing ye are dead to sin, are baptized into the
      death of Christ, and are dead with him, and alive through him, sin
      therefore should not reign in you, and over you. This exhortation does not
      suppose a freewill power in man naturally, for this is spoken to persons,
      who had the Spirit and grace of Christ, and in whom God had wrought both
      to will and to do of his good pleasure; nor is this exhortation
      unnecessary to believers, though they are dead to sin, and though God has
      promised it shall not have the dominion over them, and though reigning
      sin, as divines say, cannot be in regenerate persons; for though they are
      entirely dead to sin as justified persons, yet not perfectly so as
      sanctified: they are indeed dead to sin, but sin is not dead in them; it
      struggles, it makes war, leads captive, and threatens absolute and
      universal dominion, wherefore such an exhortation is necessary; besides,
      though God has promised that sin shall not have the dominion, yet making
      use of means, such as prayer to God that it may not, striving against it,
      opposing it, in order to hinder its dominion, are no ways inconsistent
      with the promise of God, whose promises often have their accomplishment in
      the use of means: moreover, whereas some divines say, that reigning sin
      may be and others that it cannot be in regenerate persons, it should be
      observed, that if by reigning sin is meant, sinning against God out of
      malice and contempt, with the whole heart, without any struggle against
      it, or repentance for it, or so as to lose the grace of God, and never
      rise more, then it must be said that it cannot be in a regenerate man; but
      if by it is meant, falling into sin against their consciences, knowingly
      and willingly, so as to distress their minds, lose their peace, and grieve
      the Spirit of God, so as to be held under it, and be led captive by it,
      such power sin may have in them, and over them; and therefore the
      exhortation is not needless; and when the apostle says, let it not reign
      "in your mortal body", by it is either meant the whole man, or rather the
      body only, which is the instrument of sinning, and is become mortal
      through sin; and being so, is a reason why it should not reign in it,
      since it has done so much mischief to it already: and this also denotes
      the time of sin's being in us, and of the danger of its reigning in us; it
      is only whilst we are in this mortal body; and the consideration of our
      mortality should quicken us to war against sin, and be careful not to
      <p></p>
      <p>
        obey it in the lusts thereof; the lusts of the body, or flesh, which are
        therefore sometimes called fleshly lusts, are many, and have great power
        and influence; and may be said to be obeyed, when provision is made to
        fulfil them, when these are the business of a man's life, and the whole
        of his conversation is taken up in them, without struggle against them,
        or opposition to them; and heroin lies the reign of sin.

      </p>
      Neither yield ye your members,.... The apostle more fully explains what he
      means by obeying sin in the lusts thereof; a presenting, or making use of
      the "members, as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin": by their
      "members" he means the several powers and faculties of the soul, and so
      the Ethiopic version renders it, "your souls"; or the several parts of the
      body, or both; by "yielding", or presenting of them, is designed the
      employment of them in the service of sin,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: that is, as means of
        performing unrighteous actions, in obedience to sin, or the corruption
        of nature with its lusts: the word translated "instruments", signifies
        "arms" or "weapons": so the ancients (w) formerly reckoned weapons the
        members of soldiers; and here the apostle calls the members weapons,
        which he would not have the saints use in favour of sin, an enemy and a
        tyrant; for that would be unrighteous in itself, and injurious to God
        and themselves: says he,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead:
        that is, present themselves soul and body to God, give up and devote
        themselves to him, and to his service, and yield a cheerful obedience to
        him; considering themselves as under great obligation so to do, inasmuch
        as they are freed from condemnation and death, by the righteousness of
        Christ; and quickened, when dead in trespasses and sins, by his Spirit
        and grace; and therefore should yield
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>your members, their whole selves,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>as instruments, or weapons</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        of righteousness unto God; by fighting against sin, revenging all
        disobedience, and fulfilling obedience to the commands of God: the same
        is here meant, as is by putting on "the armour of light"
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012">Rom 13:12</a>, and wearing and
        making use of "the armour of righteousness, on the right hand and the

      For sin shall not have dominion over you,.... It has dominion over God's
      people in a state of unregeneracy: and after conversion it is still in
      them, and has great power oftentimes to hinder that which is good, and to
      effect that which is evil; it entices and ensnares, and brings into
      captivity, and seems as though it would regain its dominion, and reign
      again, but it shall not. This is not a precept, exhortation, or
      admonition, as before, though some read it as such, "let not sin have
      dominion over you"; nor does it express merely what ought not to be, but
      what cannot, and shall not be; it is an absolute promise, that sin shall
      not have the dominion over believers; and respects not acts of sin, but
      the principle of sin; and means not its damning power, though that is took
      away, but its tyrannical, governing power: "it shall not lord it over
      you", as the words may be rendered; for in regeneration, sin is dethroned;
      Christ enters as Lord, and continues to be so; saints are in another
      kingdom, the kingdom of Christ and grace; could sin reign again over them,
      they might be lost and perish, which they never can: now this is a noble
      argument why saints should use their members as weapons of righteousness
      for God and against sin; since they are sure of being conquerors, and are
      secure from the tyrannical government of sin over them. The Jewish doctors
      say (x), there are three persons, , "over whom the evil imagination", or
      "sin, had not the dominion"; and these are they, Abraham, Isaac, and
      Jacob; but these are not the only persons, for all Abraham's spiritual
      seed, all that are of the faith of Abraham, enjoy the same favour: the
      reason of this is,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for ye are not under the law; by which is meant, not the law of nature;
        nor the civil law of the Jews; nor their ceremonial law; but either the
        law of sin, as a governing principle; or rather the moral law: this they
        were under, so as to obey it, but not in order to obtain righteousness
        by it; or as forced to obey it by its threats and terrors; they were not
        under its rigorous exaction; nor under its curse and condemnation; nor
        as irritating sin, and causing it to abound; or as a covenant of works:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but under grace; under the covenant of grace, and in the enjoyment of
        the blessings of it; under the Gospel, and the dispensation of it, which
        leads and teaches men to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts; under and
        in the possession of the grace of justification and pardon, which
        strongly influence to righteousness and holiness; and under regenerating
        and sanctifying grace as a reigning governing principle in the soul. The
        apostle's view in this is, to affect the saints with their present
        privilege, and to engage them in a cheerful conflict with sin, and to
        stir up in them an abhorrence of living in it.
