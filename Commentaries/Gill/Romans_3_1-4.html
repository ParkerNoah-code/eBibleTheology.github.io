      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        In this chapter are an answer to several objections which follow one
        upon another, relating to what the apostle had said concerning the
        equality of the Gentiles with the Jews; and various proofs out of the
        Psalms and Prophets, showing the general depravity and corruption of
        mankind, of the Jews as well as of the Gentiles; and the conclusion from
        all this, that there is no justification by the works of the law, but by
        the righteousness of God received by faith, of which a large and clear
        account is given. The first objection is in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#001">Rom 3:1</a>, and is taken from
        the unprofitableness of being a Jew and a circumcised person, if that is
        true which is asserted in the preceding chapter; to which an answer is
        given (Rom 3:2) showing
        that though many things might be instanced in, in which the Jew had the
        advantage of the Gentile in external things; this might be mentioned as
        one for all, and taken sufficient answer, that the Jews had the oracles
        or word of God committed to their trust, by which they became acquainted
        with the will of God. The apostle foreseeing that another objection
        would arise upon this; what signifies their having the oracles of God,
        when these are not believed by them? prevents it by observing (Rom 3:3) that though some
        did not believe, some did, and as for the unbelief of others, the truth
        and faithfulness of God in his word were not made void by it; however
        false and deceitful men are, God is always true to his word (Rom 3:4) and which is
        confirmed by a passage of Scripture, cited out of
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004">Psa 51:4</a>, hence arises
        another objection, that if the righteousness of God is commended and
        illustrated by the unrighteousness of man, then it would be unjust in
        God to take vengeance on men for their sins (Rom 3:5) which is removed
        with abhorrence, and answered by observing, that if there was any truth
        in it, the world could not be judged by God, as it certainly will (Rom 3:6) but still the
        objection is continued and strengthened (Rom 3:7) that if God is
        glorified through the sins of men, not only men ought not to be punished
        for them, but they should not be reckoned sinners, or as doers of evil
        things, but of good things, and be indulged in them; to which is
        replied, that this was the common calumny cast upon the doctrine of the
        apostle, and persons of such principles and practices are deserving of
        damnation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#008">Rom 3:8</a>. Having
        removed these objections, the apostle reassumes his former assertion,
        and supports it, that a carnal circumcised Jew is no better than a
        carnal uncircumcised Gentile; it being already sufficiently made to
        appear, that they are both under the power and guilt of sin; and as a
        further evidence of it, he produces several passages out of the book of
        Psalms, and out of the prophecies of Isaiah, which fully express the sad
        corruption of human nature, and especially of the Jews; and this account
        begins in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#010">Rom 3:10</a>, and
        ends in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#018">Rom 3:18</a>, and
        which account he suggests (Rom 3:19) carries in it
        such a full conviction of the truth of what he had said, that all men
        are under sin, that no one would be able to open his mouth in his own
        defence, but all must acknowledge themselves guilty before God: and then
        he proceeds to the conclusion he meant to draw from all this, that there
        is no justification of any before God by the deeds of the law; giving
        this as a reason for it, because the law discovered sin, but not a
        justifying righteousness (Rom 3:20) that is revealed
        in another way, by the Gospel, and not the law, though both law and
        prophets bear a testimony to it (Rom 3:21) which
        righteousness is described by the author of it, God; by the means
        through which it comes to the use and comfort of men, the faith of
        Christ; and by the subjects of it, them that believe; in the
        justification of which there is no difference (Rom 3:22) of which a
        reason is given (Rom 3:23)
        taken from the general state of men, as sinners, and bereaved of the
        image of God: the several causes, ways, means, and end of the
        justification of such persons are suggested; the moving cause is the
        free grace of God, the meritorious or procuring cause the redemption
        that is in Christ (Rom 3:24) and his
        propitiatory sacrifice (Rom 3:25) which is owing
        to the eternal purpose of God, whose end in it was to declare his
        purity, holiness, and justice; which end is repeated and enlarged on, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#026">Rom 3:26</a>, upon which the
        apostle asks (Rom 3:27)
        what is become of boasting in the creature? and answers himself by
        saying, it was excluded, not by the doctrine of works, but by the
        doctrine of faith, and particularly the doctrine of justification by
        faith in the righteousness of Christ; wherefore the conclusion stands
        firm and just, from the premises, that justification is by faith without
        the works of the law (Rom 3:28) and it is
        further confirmed, that Jews and Gentiles, with respect to their state
        and condition God-ward, are on a level; he is the God of the one, as
        well as of the other (Rom 3:29) and this appears
        by his justifying both in one and the same way, through faith in the
        righteousness of this Son (Rom 3:30) and the chapter
        is concluded by obviating an objection that might be made, that through
        this doctrine of justification by faith the law is made void, and is of
        no use (Rom 3:31) to which
        the apostle answers, that this is so far from being fact, that the law
        is established by it.

      What advantage then hath the Jew?.... If he is not properly a Jew, who is
      born of Jewish parents, and brought up in the customs, rites, and religion
      of the Jewish nation, but anyone of whatsoever nation, that is born again
      of water, and of the Spirit; where is the superior excellency of the Jew
      to the Gentile? A man may as well be born and brought up a Heathen as a
      Jew; the one has no more advantages than the other by his birth and
      education: it may be rendered, "what hath the Jew more?" or "what has he
      superfluous" or "abundant?" the phrase answers to the Hebrew in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc001.htm#003">Ecc 1:3</a>, which is rendered,
      "what profit hath a man?" and in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc006.htm#008">Ecc 6:8</a>, , "what hath a wise
      man more", &amp;c. and in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#011">Rom 3:11</a>, , "what is a man
      better?" the first of these passages the Septuagint render by , "what
      abundance?" and the last by "what more", or "superfluous", or "abundant?"
      the phrase used by the apostle here:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or what profit is there of circumcision? since that which is outward in
        the flesh profits not unless the law is kept, otherwise circumcision is
        no circumcision; and if an uncircumcised Gentile keeps the law, he is a
        better man than a circumcised Jew; yea, he judges and condemns him; for
        the only true circumcision is internal, spiritual, and in the heart. To
        this the apostle answers in the
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#002">Rom 3:2</a>.
      </p>

      Much every way,.... The circumcised Jew has greatly the advantage of the
      uncircumcised Gentile, , "in all respects", , "on every side", as the
      Rabbins speak; phrases to which this in the text answers:
      <p></p>
      <p>chiefly; more especially, particularly, and in the first place;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        because that unto them were committed the oracles of God; by which are
        meant the law of Moses, and the writings of the prophets, the
        institutions of the ceremonial law, and the prophecies of the Messiah
        and the Gospel church state; and in a word, all the books of the Old
        Testament, and whatsoever is contained in them; which are called so,
        because they are of divine inspiration, contain the mind and will of
        God, and are infallible and authoritative: and it was the privilege and
        profit of the Jews that they were intrusted with them, when other
        nations were not, and so had the advantage of them; they had them for
        their own use; for hereby they had a more clear and distinct knowledge
        of God than the Gentiles could have by the light of nature; and besides,
        became acquainted with the doctrines of a trinity of persons in the
        Godhead, of the sonship and deity of the Messiah, of the sacrifice,
        satisfaction, and righteousness of the Redeemer, and of salvation by
        him; and also with the manner of worshipping of God according to his
        will; all which the Gentiles were ignorant of. Moreover, they had the
        honour of being the keepers of these sacred books, these divine oracles,
        and of transmitting them to posterity, for the use of others.

      </p>
      For what if some did not believe?.... It is suggested, that though the
      Jews enjoyed such a privilege, some of them did not believe; which is an
      aggravation of their sin, that they should have such means of light,
      knowledge, and faith, such clear and full evidences of things, and yet be
      incredulous: though it should be observed that this was the case only of
      some, not of all; and must be understood, not of their disbelief of the
      Scriptures being the word of God, for these were always received as such
      by them all, and were constantly read, heard, and attended to; but either
      of their disobedience to the commands of God required in the law, or of
      their disregard to the promises of God, and prophecies of the Messiah, and
      of their disbelief in the Messiah himself when he came; but now this was
      no objection to the advantage they had of the Gentiles, since this was not
      owing to want of evidence in the word of God, but to the darkness and
      unbelief of their minds: and,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? no, their
        unbelief could not, and did not make void the veracity and faithfulness
        of God in his promises concerning the Messiah, recorded in the oracles
        of God, which they had committed to them; for notwithstanding this, God
        raised up the Messiah from among them, which is another advantage the
        Jews had of, the Gentiles; inasmuch as "of" them, "as concerning the
        flesh, Christ came, who is God over all, blessed for evermore" (Rom 9:5) and he sent him
        to them, to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, as a prophet and
        minister; he sent his Gospel to them first, and called out by it from
        among them his elect, nor did he take it from them until he had done
        this: and he took it away only; until "the fulness of the Gentiles" (Rom 11:25) is brought in;
        and then the Gospel shall come to them again with power, and "all Israel
        shall be saved" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#026">Rom 11:26</a>.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004">Romans 3:4</a>
      </p>

      </p>
      God forbid, yea, let God be true, but every man a liar,.... Let no such
      thing ever enter into the minds of any, that the truth of God can be, or
      will be made of none effect by the want of faith in man; let it be always
      asserted and abode by; that God is true, faithful to his word, constant in
      his promises, and will always fulfil his purposes; though "every man is a
      liar", vain, fallacious, and inconstant: referring to
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#011">Psa 116:11</a>;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as it is written,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004">Psa 51:4</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome
        when thou art judged. This is a proof that God is true, and stands to
        his word, though men are fallacious, inconstant, and wicked. God made a
        promise to David, that of the fruit of his body he would set upon his
        throne; that the Messiah should spring from him; that he would of his
        seed raise up unto Israel a Saviour. Now David sinned greatly in the
        case of Bathsheba,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#003">Sa2 11:3</a> (title), but his
        sin did not make of no effect the truth and faithfulness of God: though
        David showed himself to be a weak sinful man, yet God appeared true and
        faithful to every word of promise which he had sworn in truth to him;
        and therefore when he was brought to a sense of his evil, and at the
        same time to observe the invariable truth and faithfulness of God, said,
        "I acknowledge my transgression, &amp;c. against thee, thee only have I
        sinned and done this evil in thy sight" (Psa 51:3) which confession
        of sin I make, "that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings"; or
        "when thou speakest" (Psa 51:4) which is all
        one; that is, that thou mightest appear to be just, and faithful, and
        true in all thy promises, in every word that is gone out of thy mouth,
        which shall not be recalled and made void, on account of my sins; for
        though I have sinned, thou abidest faithful; and this also I declare
        with shame to myself, and with adoring views of thine unchangeable truth
        and goodness: "that thou mightest overcome"; that is, put to silence all
        such cavils and charges, as if the faith of God could be made void by
        the unfaithfulness of men: "when thou art judged"; when men will be so
        bold and daring to arraign thy truth and faithfulness, and contend with
        thee about them. This now is brought as a full proof, and is a full
        proof of this truth, that God is always true to his word, though men
        fail in theirs, and fall into sin. God kept his word with David
        concerning the stability of his kingdom, his successor, and the Messiah
        that should spring from him, though he acted a bad part against God.
        There is some little difference between these words as they stand in the
        Hebrew text of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004">Psa 51:4</a>;
        and as they are cited and rendered by the apostle, in the last clause of
        them; in the former it is, "that thou mightest be clear"; in the latter,
        "that thou mightest overcome". Now to vindicate the apostle's version,
        let it be observed, that the Hebrew word signifies to "overcome", as
        well as to "be clear"; of which instances may be given out of the Jewish
        writings. Says (l) Rabba; concerning an argument used by R. Chanina, in
        a controversy with other Rabbins, by this R. Chanina ben Antigonus,
        "hath overcome" them: and in another place (m), whosoever "overcomes" a
        king, they cast him into an empty ditch; where the gloss upon it is, he
        that overcomes a king by words, that is, by disputing with him, which is
        a disgrace to a king. So the word is used in the Syriac language in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033">Joh 16:33</a>. Moreover, the
        sense is the same, be it rendered either way; for as a man, when he
        overcomes his adversary, and carries his point against him, is clear of
        his charges and cavils, so God, when he overcomes in judgment, is clear
        of the imputations of wicked men. Another difference in the citation is,
        that what in the psalm is rendered "when thou judgest", is by the
        apostle, "when thou art judged" (Psa 51:4) the word, which
        is used by the Psalmist, may be rendered either way; either "when thou
        judgest", as a word of the same form is rendered, when "thou speakest",
        in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#004">Psa 51:4</a>; or "when
        anyone judges of thee", or "when thou art judged": a like instance is in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#002">Psa 46:2</a>; and so it is
        rendered by the Septuagint, and followed by the apostle, though the word
        he uses may be considered in the middle voice, and may have an active
        signification in it; and the phrase, , may be rendered, "when thou
        judgest", and then both agree.
