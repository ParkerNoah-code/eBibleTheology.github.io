      What shall we say then? is the law sin?.... The apostle having said, that
      "the motions of sins were by the law",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005">Rom 7:5</a>, meets with an
      objection, or rather an ill natured cavil, "is the law sin?" if the
      motions sins are by it, then it instigates and prompts men to sin; it
      cherishes it in them; it leads them and impels them to the commission of
      it, and therefore must be the cause of sin; and if the cause of sin, then
      it must be sin, or sinful itself: "what shall we say then?" how shall we
      remove this difficulty, answer this objection, and silence this cavil? To
      this it is replied by way of detestation and abhorrence,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God forbid! a way of speaking often made use of by the apostle, when any
        dreadful consequence was drawn from, or any shocking objection was made
        to his doctrine, and which was so monstrous as scarcely to deserve any
        other manner of refutation; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003">Rom 3:3</a>; and next by
        observing the use of the law to discover sin; which it does by
        forbidding it, and threatening it with death; by accusing for it,
        convincing of it, and representing it in its proper colours, it being as
        a glass in which it may be beheld just as it is, neither greater nor
        less; which must be understood as attended with a divine power and
        light, otherwise as a glass is of no use to a blind man, so neither is
        the law in this sense, to a man in a state of darkness, until the Spirit
        of God opens his eyes to behold in this glass what manner of man he is:
        now since the law is so useful to discover, and so to discountenance
        sin, that itself cannot be sin, or sinful. The apostle exemplifies this
        in his own case, and says,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; which he says not in the
        person of another, there is no room nor reason for such a fancy; but in
        his own person, and of himself: not of himself at that present time, as
        is evident from his way of speaking; nor of himself in his childhood,
        before he came to years of discretion to discern between good and evil;
        but as, and when he was a grown person, and whilst a Pharisee,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005">Phi 3:5</a>; he did not know
        sin during his being in that state till the law came, and entered into
        his conscience, and then, and by it, he knew sin,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#007">Rom 7:7</a>, the exceeding
        sinfulness of it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013">Rom 7:13</a>, and that he
        himself was the chief of sinners,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015">Ti1 1:15</a>. Nay he goes on
        to observe, that by the law he came to know, not only the sinfulness of
        outward actions, but also of inward lusts; says he,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for I had not known lust, except the law had said, thou shall not covet:
        as it does in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017">Exo 20:17</a>.
        This is a way of speaking used by the Jews, when they produce any
        passage out of the law, thus (e), , "the law says", if anyone comes to
        kill thee; referring either to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#011">Sa1 24:11</a> or
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#001">Exo 22:1</a>; and a little
        after, "the law says", namely, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005">Exo 3:5</a>, "put off thy
        shoes from off thy feet", &amp;c. By "lust" is meant the inward motions
        of sin in the heart, any and every desire of the mind after it; not only
        studied and concerted schemes, how to bring about and compass an evil
        action; but every loose vagrant thought of sin, and inclination to it;
        yea, every imagination of the thought of the heart, before the
        imagination is well formed into a thought; and not only a dallying with
        sin in the mind, dwelling upon it with pleasure in thought, but even
        such sudden motions and starts of the mind to sin, to which we give no
        assent; such as are involuntary, yea, contrary to the will, being "the
        evil we would not",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019">Rom 7:19</a>, and are
        displeasing and hateful to us; these are meant by lust, and which by the
        law of God are known to be sinful, and only by that. These were not
        known to be so by the Gentiles, who only had the law and light of
        nature; nor are they condemned, nor any provision made against them, nor
        can there be any made, by the laws of men: and though these inward lusts
        are condemned by the law of God, yet inasmuch as they were not
        punishable by men, and could be covered with the guise of an external
        righteousness, multitudes who were born under, and brought up in that
        law, were secure and indolent about them, did not look upon them as
        sins, or as at all affecting their righteousness; but imagined that,
        "touching the righteousness of the law", they were "blameless",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006">Phi 3:6</a>; which was the
        case of all the Pharisees, and of the apostle whilst such: but when the
        law came and entered his conscience with power and light attending it,
        then he saw, such innumerable swarms of lusts in his heart, and these to
        be sinful, which he never saw and knew before: just as in a sunbeam we
        behold those numerous little bits of dust, which otherwise are
        indiscernible by us. Now since the law is of such use, not only to
        discover the sinfulness of outward actions, but also of inward lusts and
        desires, that itself cannot be sinful.

      But sin taking occasion by the commandment,.... By "the commandment" is
      meant, either the whole moral law, or that particular commandment, "thou
      shalt not covet", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#017">Exo 20:17</a>,
      which, the Jews say, comprehends all;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "God, (say they (f),) caused them (the Israelites) to hear the ten
        words, which he concluded with this word, "thou shalt not covet"; , "for
        all of them depend on that": and to intimate, that whoever keeps this
        commandment, it is as if he kept the whole law, and whoever transgresses
        this, it is all one as if he transgressed the whole law;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and no doubt but it does refer to any unlawful thought of, desire after,
        and inclination to anything forbidden in the other commandments. By
        "sin" is meant, not the devil, as some of the ancients thought; but the
        vitiosity and corruption of nature, indwelling sin, the law in the
        members that took "occasion" by the law of God; so that the law at most
        could only be an occasion, not the cause of sin, and besides, this was
        an occasion not given by the law, but taken by sin; so that it was sin,
        and not the law, which
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        wrought in him all manner of concupiscence. The law forbidding every
        unclean thought, and covetous desire of unlawful objects, sin took an
        occasion through these prohibitions to work in him, stir up and excite
        concupiscence, evil desire after all manner of things forbidden by the
        law; hence it is clear that not the law, but sin, is exceeding sinful:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for without the law sin was dead; not that, before the law of Moses was
        given, sin lay dead and unexerted, for during that interval between Adam
        and Moses sin was, and lived and reigned, and death by it, as much as at
        any other time; but when the apostle was without the law, that is,
        without the knowledge of the spirituality of it, before it came with
        power and light into his heart and conscience, sin lay as though it was
        dead; it was so in his apprehension, he fancied himself free from it,
        and that he was perfectly righteous.

      </p>
      For I was alive without the law once,.... The apostle says this, not in
      the person of Adam, as some have thought; who lived indeed, in a state of
      innocence, a perfectly holy and righteous life, but not without the law,
      which was the rule of his actions, and the measure of his obedience; he
      had the law of nature written upon his heart, and a positive law
      respecting the forbidden fruit given him, as a trial of his obedience; and
      though when he transgressed he became mortal, yet sin could not be said to
      revive in him, which never lived before; nor does the apostle speak in the
      person of a Jew, or the whole body of the people of Israel before the law
      was given on Mount Sinai; before that time the sons of Abraham did not
      live without a law; for besides the law of nature, which they had in
      common with others, they were acquainted with other laws of God, as the
      laws of circumcision, sacrifices, and the several duties of religion; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#019">Gen 18:19</a>; and when the law
      did come from Mount Sinai, it had not such effects upon them as are here
      expressed: but the apostle is speaking of himself, and that not as in his
      state of infancy before he could discern between good and evil, but when
      grown up, and whilst a Pharisee; who, though he was born under the law,
      was brought up and more perfectly instructed in it than the common people
      were, and was a strict observer of it, yet was without the knowledge of
      the spirituality of it; he, as the rest of the Pharisees, thought it only
      regarded the outward actions, and did not reach to the spirits or souls of
      men, the inward thoughts and affections of the mind; the law was as it
      were at a distance from him, it had not as yet entered into his heart and
      conscience; and whilst this was his case he was "alive", he did not know
      that he "was dead in trespasses and sins",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#001">Eph 2:1</a>, a truth he
      afterwards was acquainted with; nor that he was so much as disordered by
      sin; he thought himself healthful, sound, and whole, when he was diseased
      and full of wounds, bruises, and sores, from head to foot; he lived in the
      utmost peace and tranquillity, without the least ruffle and uneasiness,
      free from any terror or despondency, and in perfect security, being in
      sure and certain hope of eternal life; and concluded if ever any man went
      to heaven he certainly should, since, as he imagined, he lived a holy and
      righteous life, free of all blame, and even to perfection;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but when the commandment came; not to Adam in the garden of Eden; nor to
        the Israelites on Mount Sinai; but into the heart and conscience of the
        apostle, with power and light from above:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        sin revived; it lift up its monstrous head, and appeared in its ugly
        shape, exceeding sinful indeed; it grew strong and exerted itself; its
        strugglings and opposition, its rebellion and corruption were seen and
        felt, which show that it was not dead before, only seemed to be so; it
        was in being, and it lived and acted before as now; the difference was
        not in that, but in the apostle's sense and apprehension of it, who upon
        sight of it died away:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and I died; he now saw himself a dead man, dead in sin, dead in law,
        under a sentence of death which he now had within himself; he saw he was
        deserving of eternal death, and all his hopes of eternal life by his
        obedience to the law of works died at once; he now experimentally learnt
        that doctrine he so much insisted afterwards in his ministry, and to the
        last maintained, that there can be no justification of a sinner by the
        deeds of the law, since by it is the knowledge of sin.

      </p>
      And the commandment which was ordained to life,.... The law which promised
      a continuance of an immortal life to Adam, in case of perfect obedience to
      it; and which was appointed to the Israelites, that by the observation of
      it they might live in the land of Canaan, and in the quiet and full
      possession of their privileges and enjoyments; but was never ordained to
      eternal life, or that men should obtain that by their obedience to it;
      since eternal life is the free gift of God, without respect to any works
      of men; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#021">Gal 3:21</a>; This same law, the
      apostle says,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I found to be unto death; as it was an occasion, through the vitiosity
        of nature, of stirring up sin in him, which brought forth fruit unto
        death; as it convinced him that he was a dead man and worthy of death;
        as it threatened him with it, and struck all his hopes of eternal life
        dead, and left him in this condition without giving him the least
        direction or assistance whereby to obtain life.

      </p>
      For sin taking occasion by the commandment,.... As in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008">Rom 7:8</a>,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        deceived me; either by promising pleasure or impunity: the same effect
        is ascribed by the Jews to the evil imagination or corruption of nature,
        which they say is called an enticer, , "that deceives man" (g):
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and by it slew me; mortally wounded me: not the law, but sin by the law,
        deceived and slew him; so that as before, the law is cleared from being
        the cause of sin, so here, from being the cause of death; for though the
        law is a killing letter, the ministration of condemnation and death, yet
        it is not the cause of it; but sin, which is a transgression of the law,
        is that which deceives or leads out of the way, as the word signifies,
        and then kills. The metaphor is taken from a thief or a robber, who
        leads a man out of the way into some bypath, and then murders him.

      </p>
      Therefore the law is holy,.... This is a conclusion or inference drawn
      from the preceding discourse, in commendation of the law; that standing
      clear of any charge or imputation of sin, as being the cause of it. This
      epithet the apostle gives to the law is what the Jews frequently give it;
      worthy are the Israelites, say they (h),
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "to whom is given "the holy law"; in which they study day and night.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        By "the law" is meant the whole body of the precepts of it in general;
        and by
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the commandment, either the same, or everyone of the commandments in
        particular, and especially that which is cited, "thou shall not covet".
        Some have thought that the three properties of it design the threefold
        division of the law; and suppose that by that which is "holy" is meant
        the ceremonial law, which sanctified to the purifying of the flesh; by
        that which is "just", the judicial law, which pointed out to the Jewish
        commonwealth what was right and wrong; and by that which is "good", the
        moral law in all its precepts: but nothing is more certain, than that
        the moral law is only spoken of in this context, which may be said to be
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        holy, because of its author, the holy God, from whom nothing can come
        but what is holy; and because of the matter of it, it is a transcript of
        the holy nature of God, a declaration of his holy will; it requires
        holiness both of heart and life; it forbids whatever is unholy, and
        commands nothing but what is holy; it teaches men to live holy, sober,
        righteous, and godly lives. It may be truly called
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        just, or righteous, as it demands perfect obedience to all its precepts,
        or it will not admit of it as a righteousness; as it pronounces guilty,
        curses and condemns for every disobedience of it; as it deals
        impartially with persons the transgressors of it; and as it acquits
        believers upon the foot of the righteousness of Christ, the fulfilling
        end of it. It is rightly called
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        good, from the author of it, God, from whom every good thing comes, and
        nothing else; from the matter of it, and from the use of it both to
        saints and sinners.

      </p>
      Was then that which is good, made death unto me?.... An objection is
      started upon the last epithet in commendation of the law; and it is as if
      the objector should say, if the law is good, as you say, how comes it to
      pass that it is made death, or is the cause of death to you? can that be
      good, which is deadly, or the cause of death? or can that be the cause of
      death which is good? This objection taken out of the mouth of another
      person proceeds upon a mistake of the apostle's meaning; for though he had
      said that he died when the commandment came, and found by experience that
      it was unto death, yet does not give the least intimation that the law was
      the cause of his death; at most, that it was only an occasion, and that
      was not given by the law, but taken by sin, which, and not the law,
      deceived him and slew him. Nor is it any objection to the goodness of the
      law, that it is a ministration of condemnation and death to sinners; for
      "lex non damnans, non est lex", a law without a sanction or penalty, which
      has no power to condemn and punish, is no law, or at least a law of no use
      and service; nor is the judge, or the sentence which he according to law
      pronounces upon a malefactor, the cause of his death, but the crime which
      he is guilty of; and the case is the same here, wherefore the apostle
      answers to this objection with abhorrence and detestation of fixing any
      such charge upon the law, as being the cause of death to him, saying,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God forbid; a way of speaking used by him, as has been observed, when
        anything is greatly disliked by him, and is far from his thoughts.
        Moreover, he goes on to open the true end and reason of sin, by the law
        working death in his conscience;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is
        good; that is, the vitiosity and corruption of nature, which is designed
        by sin, took an occasion, "by that which is good", that is, the law,
        through its prohibition of lust, to work in me all maimer of
        concupiscence, which brought forth fruit unto death; wherefore, upon the
        law's entrance into my heart and conscience, I received the sentence of
        death in myself, that so sin by it, "working death in me, might appear
        sin" to me, which I never knew before. This end was to be, and is
        answered by it, yea,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful; that the
        corruption of nature might not only be seen and known to be sin, but
        exceeding sinful; as being not only contrary to the pure and holy nature
        of God, but as taking occasion by the pure and holy law of God to exert
        itself the more, and so appear to be as the words , may be rendered,
        "exceedingly a sinner", or "an exceeding great sinner"; that being the
        source and parent of all actual sins and transgressions; wherefore not
        the law, but sin, was the cause of death, which by the law is discovered
        to be so very sinful.

      For we know that the law is spiritual,.... We who have a spiritual
      understanding of the law, who have been led into the true nature of it by
      the Spirit of God, know by experience that that itself is "spiritual"; and
      therefore can never be the cause of sin or death: the law may be said to
      be "spiritual", because it comes from the Spirit of God; and reaches to
      the spirit of man; it requires truth in the inward parts; spiritual
      service and obedience; a serving of it with our minds; a worshipping of
      God in spirit and truth; a loving of him with all our hearts and souls, as
      well as a performance of all the outward acts of religion and duty; and
      because it cannot be truly obeyed and conformed to without the assistance
      of the Spirit of God. To this spirituality of the law the apostle opposes
      himself,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but I am carnal, sold under sin: from hence to the end of the chapter
        many are of opinion, that the apostle speaks in the person of an
        unregenerate man, or of himself as unregenerate; but nothing is more
        clear, than that he speaks all along of himself in the first person, "I
        am carnal":, &amp;c. , "I myself", as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025">Rom 7:25</a>, and in the
        present tense of what he then was and found; whereas, when he speaks of
        his unregenerate state, and how it was with him under the first
        convictions of sin, he speaks of them as things past,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#005">Rom 7:5</a>; besides, several
        things which are said by the apostle can neither agree with him, nor any
        other, but as regenerate; such as to "hate evil", "delight in the law of
        God", and "serve it with the mind",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015">Rom 7:15</a>. Moreover, the
        distinctions between flesh and spirit, the inward and the outward man,
        and the struggle there is between them, are to be found in none but
        regenerate persons; and to say no more, the thanksgiving for deliverance
        from sin by Christ can only come from such; nor are any of the things
        said inapplicable to men that are born again, as will appear by the
        consideration of them as they follow: for when the apostle says, "I am
        carnal"; his meaning is, either that he was so by nature, and as he saw
        himself when sin through the law became exceeding sinful to him; or as
        he might be denominated from the flesh or corruption of nature which was
        still in him, and from the infirmities of the flesh he was attended
        with; just as the Corinthians, though sanctified in Christ Jesus, and
        called to be saints, are said to be "carnal" on account of their
        envying, strife, and divisions,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001">Co1 3:1</a>, or in comparison
        of the "spiritual" law of God, which was now before him, and in which he
        was beholding his face as in a glass, and with which when compared, the
        holiest man in the world must be reckoned carnal. He adds, "sold under
        sin"; he did not "sell himself" to work wickedness, as Ahab,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#025">Kg1 21:25</a>, and others; he
        was passive and not active in it; and when at any time he with his flesh
        served the law of sin, he was not a voluntary, but an involuntary
        servant; besides, this may be understood of his other I, his carnal I,
        his unrenewed self, the old man which is always under sin, when the
        spiritual I, the new man, is never under the law of sin, but under the
        governing influence of the grace of God.

      For that which I do, I allow not,.... The apostle having cleared the law
      from the charge of being the cause either of sin or death, and taken the
      blame to himself, proceeds to give an account of the struggle and combat
      he found in himself between the flesh and spirit; "that which I do, I
      allow not". That which he did was evil, since he allowed not of it; but
      this is to be understood not of any notorious crime committed by him, and
      repeated again and again; nor of a sinful course of life, for before his
      conversion he was not a profane man, but externally moral; and after his
      conversion, had his conversation in the world by the grace of God in
      righteousness and holiness; a vicious course of life being contrary to the
      grace of God implanted in him, and the doctrines of grace professed by
      him; but of internal lusts, the workings of corruptions in his heart, and
      which are real actions of the mind, together with the various frailties
      and infirmities of life: when that apostle says that what he did, "I know
      not": his meaning is, not that he was utterly ignorant of them, of their
      nature and operations; that he was insensible of their motions, and
      unconcerned about them; for his sense of them, and concern for them, are
      expressed by him in the strongest terms, "I know", "I find", "I see", "O
      wretched man", &amp;c.
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018">Rom 7:18</a>; but either that
      the efforts and effects of sin in him were so sadden, and at an unawares,
      that he was sometimes overtaken and held captive, before he knew well
      where he was, or, what he was doing; or the sense is, that he had not a
      full knowledge of the evil of his heart, the corruptions of his nature,
      nor did he understand all his infirmities and the errors of his life; or
      else the meaning is, I own it not as right, but confess it to be wrong, I
      do not acknowledge these actions as the productions of the new man, they
      are alien to him, but as the deeds of the old man; or rather, "I do not
      approve" of them, I dislike, abhor, and detest them; I cannot excuse or
      palliate them, but must condemn them; so words of knowledge in the Hebrew
      language are expressive of love, liking, and approbation; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#006">Psa 1:6</a>; on which last text,
      "I know him", says Jarchi, , "it is the language of love", or a phrase
      expressive of strong affection; and so here, I know not, I do not like,
      love, and approve of these things, or I do not "allow" of them, and
      indulge myself in them, I loathe them and myself for them; and is this
      talking like an unregenerate man? can it be thought that the apostle
      speaks of himself as unregenerate, or represents such a man?
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for what I would, that do I not; what he desired and willed was good,
        though he did it not; and so the Vulgate Latin version reads, "for not
        the good which I would, I do": and so the next clause, "but the evil
        which I hate, I do": and what was that? he would have had his thoughts
        always employed about the best things; he would have had his affections
        continually and alone set on God, Christ, and the things of another
        world; he would he was desirous to keep the whole law of God, and do the
        whole will of God, and live without sin, and as the angels do in heaven:
        now such a will as this is never to be found in unregenerate persons;
        this is from God, and the power of his grace: when he says he did not
        what he willed, what he was desirous of, and bent upon, his sense is,
        not that he never did any good thing he willed; for he did many good
        things, as every good man does, but he did not always do the good he
        willed, and never perfectly, nor anything without grace and strength
        from Christ: he adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but what I hate, that do I; sin was what he hated; it being contrary to
        the pure and holy nature of God, to the good and righteous law of God,
        and was in itself, to his view, exceeding sinful: he hated vain
        thoughts, unclean desires, revengeful lusts, the secret motions of all
        sin in his heart, and the various evil actions of life; which can never
        be said of an unregenerate man; who loves sin, delights in iniquity, and
        takes pleasure in them that do it; and yet what the apostle hated he
        did; he wrought with his carnal I, his flesh, and through the power of
        it, and force of temptation, though not without reluctance, remorse, and
        repentance. The Karaite Jews, which were the better sort of them, say
        and hold some things, not much unlike to what is here delivered;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "though a man (say they (i)) should transgress some of the commandments,
        or the commandments in part, , "through the strength of lust, and not on
        account of, or with pleasure not delight", he shall be one of those that
        shall enter into paradise.''

      </p>
      If then I do that which I would not,.... This is a corollary, or an
      inference from what he had related of his own experience; that since what
      he did, though it was contrary to the law of God, yet was what he did not
      will nor allow of, but hated, it must be a clear point, that he
      <p></p>
      <p>
        consented to the law, that it was good; lovely and amiable; that it
        forbad those things which were hateful, and commanded those things which
        were desirable to a good man; and so is acknowledged to be a very
        beautiful rule of obedience, walk, and conversation.

      </p>
      Now then, it is no more I that do it,.... This is another inference,
      deduced from what is before said, that since he did not approve, but hated
      what he did, and willed the contrary, it was not he as spiritual, as born
      again, as a new man, a new creature, that did it; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#009">Jo1 3:9</a>. He says,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But sin that dwelleth in me; the old man, the carnal I, the evil present
        with him, the law in his members; which not only existed in him, and
        wrought in him, and that at times very strongly, but dwelt in him, had
        its abode in him, as it has in all regenerate persons, and will have, as
        long as they are in the body.

      </p>
      For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh,.... The apostle goes on to
      give some further account of himself, what he knew, and was fully assured
      of by long experience; as that
      <p></p>
      <p>
        dwelleth no good thing in him, that is, in his flesh, or carnal self;
        for otherwise there were many good things dwelt in him; there was the
        good work of grace, and the good word of God in him, and even Father,
        Son, and Spirit, dwelt in him; but his meaning is, that there was no
        good thing naturally in him; no good thing of his own putting there;
        nothing but what God had put there; no good thing, but what was owing to
        Christ, to the grace of God, and influence of the Spirit; or as he
        himself explains it, there was no good thing in his "flesh"; in the old
        man that was in him, which has nothing in his nature good; no good thing
        comes out of him, nor is any good thing done by him: and this
        explanative and limiting clause, "that is, in my flesh", clearly proves,
        that the apostle speaks of himself, and as regenerate; for had he spoke
        in the person of an unregenerate man, there would have been no room nor
        reason for such a restriction, seeing an unregenerate man is nothing
        else but flesh, and has nothing but flesh, or corrupt nature in him; and
        who does not know, that no good thing dwells in such persons? whereas
        the apostle intimates by this explication, that he had something else in
        him beside flesh, and which is opposed to it; and that is spirit, or the
        new man, which is of a spiritual nature, and is seated in the spirit, or
        soul, and comes from the Spirit of God; and in this spiritual man dwell
        good things, for "the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness,
        righteousness, and truth"; so that though there was no good thing
        dwelling in his flesh, in the old than, yet there were good things
        dwelling in his spirit, in the new and spiritual man, the hidden man of
        the heart: and he adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to will is present with me; which must be understood, not of the power
        and faculty of the will, with respect to things natural and civil, which
        is common to all men; nor of a will to that which is evil, which is in
        wicked men; but of a will to that which was good, which he had not of
        himself, but from God, and is only to be found in regenerate persons;
        and denotes the readiness of his mind and will to that which is
        spiritually good, like that which Christ observes of his disciples, when
        he says, "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#041">Mat 26:41</a>, which may serve
        much to illustrate the passage before us: since it follows,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but how to perform that which is good, I find not; he found he had no
        strength of himself to do what he willed; and that he could do nothing
        without Christ; and that what he did by the strength and grace of
        Christ, he did not do perfectly. To will to live without sin, not to
        have a lustful or a revengeful thought in his breast, was present with
        him, but how to perform, how to live in this manner, which was so
        desirable to him, being born again, he found not. It may be asked, how
        does this agree with what the apostle says, "it is God which worketh in
        you both to will and to do of his good pleasure?"
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013">Phi 2:13</a>. To this it may
        be replied, that when God does work in his people both to will and to
        do, he does not work both equally alike, or to the same degree, so that
        the work answers to the will; God never works in them so to do, as to
        will, for when they are wrought in, acted upon, and influenced to do the
        most, and that in the best manner, they never do all that they would;
        and sometimes God works in them to will, when he does not work in them
        to do; as in the case of the disciples of Christ, in whom he worked to
        will to watch with Christ an hour, but did not work in them to do,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#040">Mat 26:40</a>; and whenever he
        works in the saints, whether to will or to do, or both, it is always of
        his own good pleasure.

      For the good that I would, I do not,.... The apostle here repeats what he
      had delivered in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015">Rom 7:15</a> to
      strengthen and confirm this part of his experience; that though he had a
      will to that which was good, yet he wanted power, and had none of himself
      to perform; and therefore often did what he would not, and what he would
      he did not.

      Now if I do that I would not,.... The same conclusion is formed here, as
      in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#017">Rom 7:17</a>, not with any view
      to excuse himself from blame in sinning, but to trace the lusts of his
      heart, and the sins of his life, to the source and fountain of them, the
      corruption of his nature; and to ascribe them to the proper cause of them,
      which was not the law of God, nor the new man, but sin that dwelt in him.

      </p>
      I find then a law,.... This is to be understood either of the corruption
      of nature, which he found by experience to be in him; and which, because
      of its force, power, and prevalence it sometimes had in him, he calls "a
      law"; it forcibly demanding compliance with its lusts; and is the same
      with what he calls "evil", and which the Jews so frequently style "the
      evil imagination", by which they mean the corruption of nature; and one of
      the seven names, and the first of them, by which it is called, they tell
      us (k), is, "evil"; the very name it goes by here, and which they say God
      calls it,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#005">Gen 6:5</a>; and well may it be
      so called, since it is originally, naturally, and continually evil; it is
      evil in its nature and consequences; it is the source and spring of all
      evil:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that when I would do good; says the apostle, as soon as any good thought
        arises in me, any good resolution is entered into by me, or I am about
        to do anything that is good,

      <p>evil, the vitiosity of nature,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        is present with me, and hinders me; it came into the world with me, and
        it has continued with me ever since; it cleaves close unto me, it lies
        very nigh me, and whenever there is any motion to that which is good, it
        starts up, which seemed to lie asleep before, and exerts itself, so that
        I cannot do the good I would. The Jews say (l), there are , "two hearts"
        in man, the good imagination, and the evil imagination. The apostle here
        speaks as of two wills in regenerate men, one to good, and another to
        evil: or this may be understood of the law of God, which he found agreed
        with his mind, willing that which is good, though sin lay so near to
        him; or he found that willing that which was good was the law of God,
        very agreeable to it; and that the law was on his side, favouring him,
        encouraging him to that which is good, though sin kept so close to him;
        to which sense agree the following words.

      For I delight in the law of God,.... This an unregenerate man cannot do;
      he does not like its commands, they are disagreeable to his corrupt
      nature; and as it is a threatening, cursing, damning law, it can never be
      delighted in by him: the moralist, the Pharisee, who obeys it externally,
      do not love it, nor delight in it; he obeys it not from love to its
      precepts, but from fear of its threatenings; from a desire of popular
      esteem, and from low, mercenary, selfish views, in order to gain the
      applause of men, and favour of God: only a regenerate man delights in the
      law of God; which he does, as it is fulfilled by Christ, who has answered
      all the demands of it: and as it is in the hands of Christ, held forth by
      him as a rule of holy walk and conversation; and as it is written upon his
      heart by the Spirit of God, to which he yields a voluntary and cheerful
      obedience: he serves it with his mind, of a ready mind freely, and without
      any constraint but that of love; he delights together with the law, as the
      word here used signifies; the delight is mutual and reciprocal, the law
      delights in him, and he delights in the law; and they both delight in the
      selfsame things, and particularly in the perfect obedience which the Son
      of God has yielded to it. The apostle adds,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        after the inward man; by which he means the renewed man, the new man, or
        new nature, formed in his soul; which had its seat in the inward part,
        is an internal principle, oil in the vessel of the heart, a seed under
        ground, the kingdom within us, the hidden man of the heart, which is not
        obvious to everyone's view, it being not anything that is external,
        though never so good: this in its nature is agreeable to the law of God,
        and according to this a regenerate man delights in it: but then this
        restrictive limiting clause supposes another man, the old man, the
        carnal I, according to which the apostle did not delight in the law of
        God; and proves, that he speaks of himself as regenerate, and not as
        unregenerate, or as representing an unregenerate man, because no such
        distinction is to be found in such a person; nor does such a person
        delight at all, in any sense, upon any consideration in the law of God,
        but is enmity against it, and not subjected to it; nor can he be
        otherwise, without the grace of God.

      But I see another law in my members,.... That is, he saw, he perceived it
      by experience; he felt the force and power of inbred corruption working in
      him, and as a law demanding obedience to it; and which he might well call
      "another law", it being not only distinct from, but opposite to the law of
      God he delighted in; the one is good, the other evil; this other law is a
      transgression of the law of God, and which he observed to be "in his
      members", i.e. in the members of his body; not that it had its seat only,
      or chiefly in his body, and the parts of it, but because it exerted itself
      by them, it made use of them to fulfil its lusts: the same phrase is used
      in the Targum on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#003">Psa 38:3</a>; which renders the
      words there thus, there is no peace, "in my members" because of my sin:
      now this law was, says he,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        warring against the law of my mind; by the "law of his mind" is meant,
        either the law of God written on his mind in conversion, and which he
        delighted in, and served with his mind, as renewed by the Spirit of God;
        or the new nature in him, the principle of grace wrought in his mind,
        called "the law" of it, because it was the governing principle there;
        which reigns, and will reign in every regenerate person through
        righteousness, unto eternal life, though the law of sin opposes all its
        force and power against it; that is not only contrary to it, lusts
        against it, but wars, and commits acts of hostility against it: the
        state of regenerate persons is a warfare, they have many enemies to
        combat with, as Satan and the world; but those of their own household,
        within themselves, in their own hearts, are the worst of all; there is a
        civil war in them, as it were a company of two armies, flesh and spirit,
        sin and grace, combating together; and so it will be as long as this
        life lasts; so true is that saying of the Jews (m), in which they agree
        with the apostle,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "as long as the righteous live, , "they are at war with the corruption
        of their nature"; when they die they are at rest:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        hence we read of , "the war of the evil imagination" (n): but what is
        worst of all, this is sometimes
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        bringing them into captivity to the law of sin, which is in their
        members; that is, to itself; for the law in the members, and the law of
        sin in the members, must be the same: and it may be said to bring into
        captivity to itself, when it only endeavours to do it, though it does
        not effect it; for sometimes words which express an effect only design
        the endeavour to effect, but not that itself; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#013">Eze 24:13</a>. But admitting
        that this phrase intends the real and actual effecting of it, it is to
        be understood of a captivity to sin, different from that an unregenerate
        man is in; who is a voluntary captive to sin and Satan, gives up himself
        to such slavery and bondage, and rather goes, than is brought or carried
        into it; whereas a regenerate man is, through the force of sin, and
        power of temptation, violently drawn and carried into captivity; in
        which he is held against his will, and to his great uneasiness: besides,
        this expression does not denote absolute dominion, which sin has not
        over a regenerate man; nor is it utterly inconsistent with his character
        as such; for as a subject of one nation may be taken a prisoner, and be
        carried captive into another nation, and yet remain a subject where he
        was, and does not become one of that country of which he is carried
        captive; so a regenerate man, being carried captive by sin, does not
        come under the absolute dominion of sin, or cease to be a subject of the
        kingdom of grace, or in other words, a regenerate person: moreover, the
        very phrase of "bringing into captivity" supposes that the person before
        was not a captive; whereas every unregenerate man one, was always so,
        and never otherwise: add to all this, that this captivity was very
        distressing and uneasy to the person, and makes him cry out, "O wretched
        man", &amp;c. whereas the captivity of an unregenerate person is very
        agreeable to him; he likes his prison, he loves his chains, and do not
        choose to be in any other state and condition; though, as the Jews (o)
        say, there is no captivity , "like the captivity of the soul"; and
        nothing so grieving and afflictive to a good man as that is. The apostle
        uses much such language as his countrymen do, who frequently represent
        man as having two principles in him, the one good, the other bad; the
        one they call , "the evil imagination", or corruption of nature; the
        other they call , "the good imagination", or principle of grace and
        goodness; which they say (p), are at continual war with each other, and
        the one is sometimes "carried captive" by the other. The good
        imagination, they say (q), is like to one that , "is bound in a prison";
        as it is said, "out of prison he cometh to reign"; to which agrees what
        they say (r),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "how shall I serve my Creator whilst I am , "a captive to my
        corruption", and a servant to my lust?''

      O wretched man that I am,.... Not as considered in Christ, for as such he
      was a most happy man, being blessed with all spiritual blessings, and
      secure from all condemnation and wrath; nor with respect to his inward
      man, which was renewing day by day, and in which he enjoyed true spiritual
      peace and pleasure; nor with regard to his future state, of the happiness
      of which he had no doubt: he knew in whom he had believed; he was fully
      persuaded nothing could separate him from the love of God; and that when
      he had finished his course, he should have the crown of righteousness laid
      up for him: but this exclamation he made on account of the troubles he met
      with in his Christian race; and not so much on account of his reproaches,
      persecutions, and distresses for Christ's sake; though these were many and
      great, yet these did not move or much affect him, he rather took delight
      and pleasure in them; but on account of that continual combat between, the
      flesh and spirit in him; or by reason of that mass of corruption and body
      of sin he carried about with him; ranch such a complaint Isaiah makes,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005">Isa 6:5</a>, which in the
      Septuagint is, , "O miserable I". This shows him to be, and to speak of
      himself as a regenerate man; since an unregenerate man feels no uneasiness
      upon that score, or makes any complaint of it, saying as here,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who shall deliver me from the body of this death? or "this body of
        death"; by which some understand, this mortal body, or the body of flesh
        subject to death for sin; and suppose the apostle expresses his desire
        to quit it, to depart out of it, that he might enjoy an immortal life,
        being weary of the burden of this mortal body he carried about with him:
        so Philo the Jew (s) represents the body as a burden to the soul, which
        "it carries about as a dead carcass", and never lays down from his birth
        till his death: though it should be observed, that when the apostle
        elsewhere expresses an earnest longing after a state of immortality and
        glory, some sort of reluctance and unwillingness to leave the body is to
        be observed, which is not to be discerned here; and was this his sense,
        one should think he would rather have said, when shall I be delivered?
        or why am I not delivered? and not who shall deliver me? though
        admitting this to be his meaning, that he was weary of the present life,
        and wanted to be rid of his mortal body, this did not arise from the
        troubles and anxieties of life, with which he was pressed, which
        oftentimes make wicked men long to die; but from the load of sin, and
        burden of corruption, under which he groaned, and still bespeaks him a
        regenerate man; for not of outward calamities, but of indwelling sin is
        he all along speaking in the context: wherefore it is better by "this
        body of death" to understand what he in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006">Rom 6:6</a> calls "the body of
        sin"; that mass of corruption that lodged in him, which is called "a
        body", because of its fleshly carnal nature; because of its manner of
        operation, it exerts itself by the members of the body; and because it
        consists of various parts and members, as a body does; and "a body of
        death", because it makes men liable to death: it was that which the
        apostle says "slew" him, and which itself is to a regenerate man, as a
        dead carcass, stinking and loathsome; and is to him like that punishment
        Mezentius inflicted on criminals, by fastening a living body to a putrid
        carcass (t): and it is emphatically called the body of "this death",
        referring to the captivity of his mind, to the law of sin, which was as
        death unto him: and no wonder therefore he so earnestly desires
        deliverance, saying, "who shall deliver me?" which he speaks not as
        being ignorant of his deliverer, whom he mentions with thankfulness in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#025">Rom 7:25</a>; or as doubting
        and despairing of deliverance, for he was comfortably assured of it, and
        therefore gives thanks beforehand for it; but as expressing the inward
        pantings, and earnest breathings of his soul after it; and as declaring
        the difficulty of it, yea, the impossibility of its being obtained by
        himself, or by any other than he, whom he had in view: he knew he could
        not deliver himself from sin; that the law could not deliver him; and
        that none but God could do it; and which he believed he would, through
        Jesus Christ his Lord.

      I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,.... There is a different
      reading of this passage; some copies read, and so the Vulgate Latin
      version, thus, "the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord"; which
      may be considered as an answer to the apostle's earnest request for
      deliverance, "who shall deliver me?" the grace of God shall deliver me.
      The grace of God the Father, which is communicated through Christ the
      Mediator by the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life which is in Christ,
      the principle of grace formed in the soul by the Spirit of God, which
      reigns in the believer as a governing principle, through righteousness
      unto eternal life, will in the issue deliver from indwelling sin, and all
      the effects of it: but the more general reading is, "thanks be to God", or
      "I thank God"; the object of thanksgiving is God, as the Father of Christ,
      and the God of all grace: the medium of it is Christ as Mediator, through
      whom only we have access to God; without him we can neither pray to him,
      nor praise him aright; our sacrifices of praise are only acceptable to
      God, through Christ; and as all our mercies come to us through him, it is
      but right and fitting that our thanksgivings should pass the same way: the
      thing for which thanks is given is not expressed, but is implied, and is
      deliverance; either past, as from the power of Satan, the dominion of sin,
      the curse of the law, the evil of the world, and from the hands of all
      spiritual enemies, so as to endanger everlasting happiness; or rather,
      future deliverance, from the very being of sin: which shows, that at
      present, and whilst in this life, saints are not free from it; that it is
      God only that must, and will deliver from it; and that through Christ his
      Son, through whom we have victory over every enemy, sin, Satan, law, and
      death; and this shows the apostle's sure and certain faith and hope of
      this matter, who concludes his discourse on this head thus:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh
        the law of sin; observe, he says, "I myself", and not another; whence it
        is clear, he does not represent another man in this discourse of his;
        for this is a phrase used by him, when he cannot possibly be understood
        of any other but himself; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Rom 9:3</a>; he divides
        himself as it were into two parts, the mind, by which he means his
        inward man, his renewed self; and "the flesh", by which he designs his
        carnal I, that was sold under sin: and hereby he accounts for his
        serving, at different times, two different laws; "the law of God",
        written on his mind, and in the service of which he delighted as a
        regenerate man; "and the law of sin", to which he was sometimes carried
        captive: and it should be taken notice of, that he does not say "I have
        served", as referring to his past state of unregeneracy, but "I serve",
        as respecting his present state as a believer in Christ, made up of
        flesh and spirit; which as they are two different principles, regard two
        different laws: add to all this, that this last account the apostle
        gives of himself, and which agrees with all he had said before, and
        confirms the whole, was delivered by him, after he had with so much
        faith and fervency given thanks to God in a view of his future complete
        deliverance from sin; which is a clinching argument and proof that he
        speaks of himself, in this whole discourse concerning indwelling sin, as
        a regenerate person.
