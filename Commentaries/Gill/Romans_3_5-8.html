      But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,.... Hence it
      appears, that the unrighteousness of men commends the righteousness, or
      faithfulness of God; and yet all unrighteousness is sin; the wrath of God
      is revealed against it; and would exclude from heaven, were it not for
      pardon through the blood of Christ; and besides, the one is contrary to
      the other, and of itself, of its own nature, cannot influence and affect
      the other: wherefore this can only be understood of the manifestation and
      illustration of, the righteousness of God by it; which is covered and
      commended, in punishing the unrighteousness of men; in setting forth
      Christ to be a propitiation for sin; and in fulfilling his promises,
      notwithstanding the failings of his people, of which the case of David is
      a pregnant proof; just as the love of God is illustrated and commended, by
      the consideration of the sins of men, for whom Christ died, and his grace
      and mercy in the conversion of them: but if this be true,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        what shall we say? shall we allow the following question to be put? this
        answers to , "what is there to say", or "to be said?" a way of speaking,
        often used by the Talmudists (n):
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        is God unrighteous, who taketh vengeance? if the premises are true, this
        is a just consequence of them; whereas God does take vengeance on men
        for their unrighteousness, both here and hereafter, it must be a piece
        of unrighteousness in him so to do; since that for which he takes
        vengeance on them commends his own righteousness; but that you may know
        as well by what follows, that this is not an inference of his own, but
        another's, he adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I speak as a man; , "according to the language of the children of men",
        a phrase often used by the Jewish doctors (o). The apostle did not speak
        the sentiments of his own mind, he represented another man, and spoke in
        the language of an adversary.

      God forbid, for then how shall God judge the world? "far be it"; such a
      notion is detestable and abominable, nor can it be fairly deduced from
      what is asserted; for it is the unrighteousness of his own people, on whom
      he takes no vengeance personally, and not the unrighteousness of others,
      on whom he does take vengeance, which commends his righteousness; and
      supposing it was that of others, God cannot be unrighteous in performing
      his threatenings, in a way of righteousness: moreover, unrighteousness is
      sin, and does not of itself but by accident, illustrate the righteousness
      of God; wherefore God is not unjust in punishing it; for how should God
      "judge the world?" whereas nothing is more certain than that he will do
      it, and that this will be done in righteousness; which could not be, was
      he unrighteous in taking vengeance; which will be one considerable part of
      that righteous judgment.

      For if the truth of God,.... The "truth of God" is the same with "the
      righteousness of God",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005">Rom 3:5</a>, and means his
      faithfulness; of which it is hypothetically said, it
      <p></p>
      <p>hath more abounded; or has been more illustrated,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through my lie to his glory: nothing is more opposite to truth than a
        lie; a lie of itself can never be of any advantage to truth, or to the
        God of truth; nothing is more contrary to the nature of God, and more
        abominable to him; a lie is of the devil, and punishable with eternal
        death; wherefore it may seem strange, that the truth of God should
        abound through it to his glory: now let it be observed, that the apostle
        is not speaking of himself, nor of his lie of unbelief, in his state of
        unregeneracy; but in the person of a sinful man, "for every man is a
        liar",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004">Rom 3:4</a>, as he says, "I
        speak as a man", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005">Rom 3:5</a>;
        representing a wicked man, who from what was before said, might collect
        this as the sense of it, that the truth of God is illustrated by the
        lies of men: and so much may be owned as the apostle's sense, that the
        truth of God is commended, illustrated, and made to abound, when it is
        asserted, that he is true and faithful, and every man is a liar,
        fallacious, and deceitful; "let God be true, and every man a liar",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#004">Rom 3:4</a>, moreover, the
        truth of God may be allowed to abound through the lies of men, in a
        comparative sense, the one being set against the other; and so as
        contraries do, illustrate each other: this may be assented to, as that
        sometimes a lie has been overruled by God, for the accomplishing of his
        purposes and promises, in which his truth and faithfulness have been
        displayed, as in the cases of Jacob and the Egyptian midwives; but then
        this does not arise from its nature and tendency, but from the
        overruling wisdom and providence of God, and therefore not to be excused
        hereby from sin; and consequently the inference from it is not just,
        that therefore "no man can, or ought to be, judged as a sinner"; since
        his sin turns to such account, as to make for the glory of God, which is
        intimated in the question:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        why yet am I also judged as a sinner? if this be the case, I ought not
        to be reckoned a sinner, or to be treated as such here, or judged and
        condemned as one hereafter, which is a most wicked, as well as weak
        consequence; for though God is true and faithful to his promises,
        notwithstanding the sins of his people, which are as a foil, to set off
        the lustre of his truth the more, yet their sins are nevertheless sins,
        and are taken notice of by him as such, and they are corrected for them;
        and however God may overrule, in a providential way, the sins of others
        for his glory, this is no excuse for their sins, nor will it be an
        exemption of them from punishment. This is the sense of the passage;
        unless by "the truth of God" should be meant, the Gospel, the word of
        truth, which is of God; and which through the apostle's "lie", as the
        Jews might call his ministration of it, "abounded to" the "glory" of
        God; being spread far and near, and made useful for the conversion of
        sinners, for turning men from darkness to light, and from the power of
        Satan unto God; and for the planting of churches in the Gentile world,
        as well as in Judea; which much conduced to the honour of God, and the
        interest of true religion: and then the meaning of the last clause is,
        "why yet am I also judged as a sinner?" why am I accounted and condemned
        as an heretic? as an apostate from the faith? as he was by the Jews, and
        who are used to call heretics sinners: so "the sinner" in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc007.htm#026">Ecc 7:26</a> is thus
        interpreted (p), "these are the heretics": and elsewhere it (q) is
        observed, that concerning the heretics it is said,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007">Pro 10:7</a>, "the name of the
        wicked shall rot": and I very much suspect this to be the sense of the
        word in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#024">Joh 9:24</a>, "we know
        that this man is a sinner"; an heretic, a man of bad principles; and in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#031">Joh 9:31</a>; "now we know
        that God heareth not sinners"; men of corrupt minds; since this
        character stands opposed to a worshipper of the God of Israel.

      And not rather, as we be slanderously reported,.... These are the
      apostle's own words, in answer to the objector he represented; and it is
      as if he should say, why do not you go on? why do you stop here? "and not
      rather" say, as we are evil spoken of, and our doctrine is blasphemed:
      <p></p>
      <p>and as some affirm; ignorantly and audaciously enough:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>that we say; and teach:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        let us do evil that good may come; a slander cast upon the apostle's
        doctrine of unconditional election, free justification, and of God's
        overruling the sins of men for good; and is the same which is cast on
        ours now, and is no small proof of the likeness and sameness of
        doctrines:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whose damnation is just; whose judgment would have been right, and their
        censure of our doctrines just, had it been true that we held such a
        principle, taught such a doctrine, or encouraged such a practice: or
        their condemnation is just, for aspersing our principles and practices
        in so vile a manner; and all such persons are deserving of damnation,
        who teach such things, or practise after this sort.
