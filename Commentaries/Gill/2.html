Behold, thou art called a Jew,.... From hence to the end of the chapter the Jews
are particularly addressed; their several privileges and characters are
commemorated, which by an ironical concession are allowed them; several charges
are brought against them, even against their principal men; and the plea in
favour of them, from their circumcision, is considered; and the apostle's view
in the whole, is to show that they could not be justified before God by their
obedience to the law of Moses: "behold"; take notice, observe it, this will be
granted: "thou art called a Jew"; thou art one by name, by nation, and by
religion; but no name, nor outward religion, nor a mere profession, will justify
before God:
<p></p>
<p>
  and restest in the law; which may be understood of their having the law and
  the knowledge of it, what is to be done and avoided easily, without any
  fatigue and labour; of their pleasing and applauding themselves with the bare
  having and hearing of it; of their trust and confidence in it; and of their
  inactivity and security in it, as persons asleep; and so of their coming short
  of the knowledge of the Gospel, and of Christ the end of the law for
  righteousness, their whole confidence being placed in that: so the Targumist
  in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#008">Jer 8:8</a> paraphrases the
  words,
</p>
<p></p>
<p>"we are wise, "and in the law of the Lord", , do we trust;''</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  and makest thy boast of God. There is a right boasting of God in opposition to
  boasting in the creature, when men ascribe all the blessings of nature and
  grace to the Lord alone, and praise him for all their enjoyments, temporal and
  spiritual; and when they trust in, and glory, and make their boast of Christ
  as the Lord their righteousness, in whom alone they are, and can be justified.
  But the boasting here spoken of, was such that was not right; these men
  boasted of their bare external knowledge of the one God, when the Gentiles
  around them were ignorant of him; of their being the covenant people of God,
  when others were aliens and strangers; and of their having the word and
  worship of the true God, which other nations were unacquainted with; and, on
  these external things they depended, which was their fault.

</p>
And knowest his will,.... Not the secret will or purpose of God; nor his
revealed will in the Gospel, for of this they were ignorant; but his declared
will in the law, showing what is to be done, and what is not to be done: to know
which in express terms was a privilege, that other people had not; but then the
bare knowledge of this will be of no avail: for persons may know their Lord's
will, as the Jews did, and not do it, and so be worthy to be beaten with many
stripes:
<p></p>
<p>
  and approvest the things that are more excellent: or "triest the things that
  differ"; from one another, and from the will and law of God; or as the Syriac,
  "discernest" "things that are convenient"; agreeable, which are fit and ought
  to be done: and having tried and discerned them, they approved of them in
  their judgment as the things more excellent; but then they did not put these
  excellent things in practice which they approved of; and the knowledge and
  approbation they had of these things, arose from their
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  being instructed out of the law, and not the Gospel; for the excellent things
  of the Gospel, they had no discerning, knowledge and approbation of; see

</p>
And art confident that thou thyself,.... Being vainly puffed up in, their
fleshly minds, they were strongly persuaded that they were very fit persons to
be
<p></p>
<p>
  a guide to the blind: all men are by nature blind, as to the knowledge of
  divine and spiritual things; the meaner sort of the people among the Jews seem
  to be intended here; or else the ignorant Gentiles, whom the Jews were very
  fond of making proselytes to their religion and laws; but miserable guides
  were they, whether to their own people, or others; blind guides of the blind.
  Gospel ministers best deserve this title:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  a light of them that are in darkness; so Christ, John the Baptist, the
  disciples of Christ, and all Gospel ministers are; but these men, who
  arrogated such characters to themselves, were dim lights, and dark lanterns.
  The apostle seems to have respect to those very high and exalted characters
  the Jews give of their doctors, as when they call one, , "the lamp of light"
  (w); another, "the holy lamps" (x); and a third, , "the lamp of Israel" (y);
  with many others of the same kind; See Gill on
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#014">Mat 5:14</a> and See Gill on
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#035">Joh 5:35</a>.

</p>
An instructor of the foolish,.... All men in a state of unregeneracy are
foolish, and need instruction; here the common people among the Jews, who knew
not the law, are meant; it was very usual to call anyone of their doctors and
masters "an instructor": it follows,
<p></p>
<p>
  a teacher of babes; either in age or in understanding; such who taught either
  of them were called by the Jews , "teachers of babes". Thus they paraphrase
  the text in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#003">Dan 12:3</a>,
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  "they that be wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament. This is
  the Judge who judges, the judgment of truth truly, and the collectors of alms:
  and they that turn, many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever;
  these are, , "the teachers of babes" (z).''
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Though these are said (a) to be inferior to the wise men, or doctors:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  which hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law: they had not a
  true knowledge of the law; only a draught and scheme, the outward form of the
  law, and a mere shadow and appearance of the knowledge of the truth of it.
  From hence the apostle would have it concluded, that though the Jews had the
  law, and in some sense knew it, yet inasmuch as they did not perform it, they
  could not be justified by it; and that even their teachers, their greatest
  masters and doctors, were very deficient, as appears from what follows; and
  since they could not be instilled by it, who taught others the knowledge of
  it, the hearers of it could not expect justification from it.

</p>
Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?.... Several
charges are here brought against the Jews, even against their teachers; for
though they are put by way of question, they are to be considered as so many
assertions and matters of fact; thus, though they taught others, they did not
teach themselves; they were blind leaders of the blind; they were ignorant of
the law, of the spirituality of it; they were desirous to be teachers of the
law, understanding neither what they said, nor whereof they affirmed: they were
ignorant of the righteousness of God, of whom they boasted; and of the more
excellent things of Moses, and the prophets, they pretended to explain; and of
the Messiah, of whom their prophecies so much spoke: and besides, what they did
understand and teach, they did not practise themselves; than which nothing is
more shameful, or more betrays stupidity and ignorance; for as they themselves
(b) say,
<p></p>
<p>
  "he that teaches men, , "that which he himself does not do", is like a blind
  man who has a lamp in his hand, and enlightens others, but he, himself walks
  in darkness.''
</p>
<p></p>
<p>And such teachers they own were among them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  "Beautiful (say they (c)) are the words which come out of the mouths of them
  that do, them: Ben Assai was a beautiful preacher, but did not well observe;''
</p>
<p></p>
<p>i.e., to do what he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Thou that preach at a man should not steal, dost thou steal? some understand
  this figuratively, of stealing, or taking away the true sense of the law, and
  putting a false one upon it; of which these men were notoriously guilty: but
  rather, it is to be understood literally, not only of the inward desires and
  motions of their minds after this sin, and of their consenting to, and
  conniving at theft and robbery, but of their doing it themselves; who, under
  pretence of long prayers, "devoured widows' houses",
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014">Mat 23:14</a>, plundered and robbed
  them of their substance: no wonder that these men preferred Barabbas, a thief
  and a robber, to Jesus Christ.

</p>
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery,.... Adultery here is to be
taken not figuratively for adulterating the word of God, and mixing it with
their own inventions; but literally for the sin of adultery, and that not in
heart only, but in act:
<p></p>
<p>
  dost thou commit adultery? an iniquity which greatly prevailed among the Jews
  at this time of day; hence Christ calls them "an adulterous generation",
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039">Mat 12:39</a>; and that to such a
  degree, that by the advice of their great Rabbi, R. Jochanan ben Zaccai, they
  left off the trial of the suspected woman, cases of this nature being so very
  numerous: and this sin prevailed not only among the common people, but among
  their principal doctors; as may be learnt from their own writings, and from
  that conviction of this iniquity which the Scribes and Pharisees were brought
  under by Christ, when the woman, taken in adultery, was had before him by
  them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#009">Joh 8:9</a>.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? for though at this time
  they abhorred idolatry, to which their forefathers were so much inclined, and
  so often fell into, yet they were guilty of sacrilege; by violating the
  worship of God, and polluting it with their own inventions; by pillaging or
  withholding, or not offering the sacrifices they ought; and by plundering the
  temple, and converting the sacred things of it to their own use.

</p>
Thou that makest thy boast of the law,.... Of their having it, which other
nations had not; of their knowledge of it, which many of their own people were
without, or had but a small share of; and of their keeping of it even to
perfection:
<p></p>
<p>
  through breaking of the law dishonourest thou God? sin sometimes is expressed
  by a word which signifies a "fall"; sometimes by another, which signifies
  missing of the mark, or straying from it; sometimes by another, which
  signifies a "contrariety to the law" of God; and here, by one which signifies
  a "passing over it", and the bounds which it has set, as the rule of man's
  obedience; and hereby God, the lawgiver, is dishonoured: for as God is
  glorified by good works, when rightly performed, he is dishonoured by evil
  ones; for his authority, as a lawgiver, is trampled upon and despised. Now
  persons guilty of such iniquities as here mentioned, could not be justified
  before God, or accepted by him on account of any works of righteousness done
  by them.

</p>
For the name of God is blasphemed,.... The being and perfections of God, such as
his holiness, omniscience, and omnipotence, are denied, or evil spoken of; and
also the law of God, and the forms of worship instituted by him:
<p></p>
<p>
  among the Gentiles through you: through their iniquities, who when they
  observe them, conclude that the God of Israel is not omniscient, or he would
  know, and take notice of these things; and that he is not holy, or he could
  not bear them; nor omnipotent, or he would revenge them:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  as it is written; the passage or passages referred to are not mentioned, but
  are perhaps <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#005">Isa 52:5</a>. In the
  former of these texts the words are, "they that rule over them make them to
  howl; saith the Lord, and my name continually every day is blasphemed"; which
  are spoken of the rulers of the people, either of their ecclesiastical or
  political rulers, or both; and so Aben Ezra interprets them of , "the great
  men of Israel"; and here by the apostle are applied to their doctors and wise
  men: and in the latter are these words, "thus saith the Lord God, I do not
  this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which ye
  have profaned among the Heathen"; that is, by their unbecoming walk and
  conversation, and especially by the disagreeable conduct of their principal
  men: and the Jews own the same things, and complain of them in much the "same
  language the apostle here does, saying, "they disgrace the law before the
  people of the earth, (the common people, or else the Gentiles,) how? a wise
  man sits and expounds in the congregation, saying, thou shalt not lend upon
  usury, and he lends upon usury; he says, thou shalt not commit a robbery, and
  he commits a robbery; he says, , "thou shalt not steal, and he steals": says
  R. Berechiah, it happened to one man that his cloak was stolen from him, and
  he went before the judge about it, and he found it spread upon his bed or
  couch: and, says the same Rabbi, it happened to a certain man that his pot was
  stolen from him, and he went before the judge about it, and he found it upon
  his hearth: hence it is said, "as they were increased they sinned against me,
  therefore will I change their glory into shame",
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#007">Hos 4:7</a> (d).
</p>

  <span class="margnote"

  >
</p>
For circumcision verily profiteth,.... The plea from circumcision in favour of
the Jews, and their acceptance with God, and justification before him, is here,
and in the following verses, considered. The apostle allows that circumcision
was profitable; which must be understood whilst it was in force, before the
abrogation of it, for since, it is not profitable but pernicious; and then it
was only profitable, in case the law was kept:
<p></p>
<p>
  if thou keepest the law; that is, perfectly; for circumcision obliged persons
  to keep the whole law. Now the circumcised Jews did not keep it in such sense;
  wherefore circumcision was of no use to them, but, on the contrary, was an
  handwriting against them.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  But if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision;
  that is, it is not accounted circumcision; it is of no avail; such a man was
  all one as an uncircumcised Gentile, and appeared to be uncircumcised in a
  spiritual sense: the apostle perhaps alludes to a practice among some of the
  Jews, to bring on and draw over the foreskin, after they had been circumcised;
  See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#018">Co1 7:18</a>.
</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026">Romans 2:26</a></p>
<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">rom 2:26</a></font></span
  >
</p>
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep,.... These words are spoken hypothetically;
if any such persons could be found among the Gentiles who keep the whole law of
God; and can only be absolutely understood of such, who from a principle of
grace act in obedience to the law; as in the hands of Christ, and who look to
Christ as the fulfilling end of it, for righteousness; in whom they keep
<p></p>
<p>the righteousness of the law perfectly:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? by this question it
  is suggested, that an uncircumcised Gentile, who keeps the law as in the hands
  of Christ, and under the influences of his Spirit and grace, and keeps it in
  Christ, is reckoned a circumcised person in a spiritual sense, and must be
  preferable to a circumcised Jew that breaks it.
</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027">Romans 2:27</a></p>
<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">rom 2:27</a></font></span
  >
</p>
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature,.... That is, the Gentiles, who
are by nature uncircumcised; for as circumcision was by the command of God, and
performed by the art of men, uncircumcision is by nature, and what men naturally
have. Now
<p></p>
<p>if it, such persons,</p>
<p></p>
<p>fulfil the law in Christ, they will</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  judge thee, the circumcision: and condemn, as Noah condemned the old world,
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007">Heb 11:7</a>, and the men of Nineveh
  and the queen of the south will condemn the men of that generation, in which
  Christ lived, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#041">Mat 12:41</a>.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Who by the letter and circumcision transgress the law; that is, either by the
  law, which is "the letter", and "by circumcision", or "by circumcision which
  is in the letter", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029">Rom 2:29</a>, sin
  being increased by the prohibitions of the moral law, and the rituals of the
  ceremonial law, and the more so by a dependence upon an obedience to either of
  them, or both, for justification.
</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028">Romans 2:28</a></p>
<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">rom 2:28</a></font></span
  >
</p>
For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly,.... The apostle removes the plea in
favour of the Jews, taken from their name and privilege, by distinguishing
between a Jew and a Jew, and between circumcision and circumcision: "he is not a
Jew which is one outwardly"; by mere name, nature, nation, religion, and
profession:
<p></p>
<p>
  neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; which takes away
  the flesh of the foreskin, but not the carnality of the heart; leaves a mark
  upon the flesh, but no impression on the mind. This is nothing, is not the
  true, solid, substantial, spiritual circumcision, which only avails in the
  sight of God.
</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029">Romans 2:29</a></p>
<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">rom 2:29</a></font></span
  >
</p>
But he is a Jew which is one inwardly,.... Who has an internal work of grace
upon his soul: who has not only an outward name, but an inward nature; not the
law of God in the hand, but in the heart; not an external righteousness only,
but internal holiness; and who is not a mere outward court worshipper, but a
worshipper of God in Spirit and in truth. The Jews have a (e) saying themselves,
<p></p>
<p>"that whosoever denies idolatry, , "is called a Jew":''</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  so that, according to them, this is a name that is not confined to themselves,
  but belongs to all such who truly fear and worship God; and they say, in the
  same place, that Pharaoh's daughter was called "a Jewess", because she denied
  idolatry, and went down to wash herself from the idols of her father's house.
  And elsewhere (f),
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  "that faith does not depend upon circumcision, but upon the heart: he that
  believes not as he should, circumcision does not make him a Jew; and he that
  believes as he ought, he indeed is a Jew, though he is not circumcised.''
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  And circumcision is that of the heart; which God requires, and he himself
  promises to give, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016">Deu 10:16</a>,
  upon which last passage, a very noted Jew (g) has this observation, , "this is
  the circumcision of the heart"; the very phrase the apostle here uses:
  circumcision of the flesh was typical of this, which lies in a godly sorrow
  for sin, in a putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, and in renouncing
  a man's own righteousness in the business of justification. The ancient Jews
  had some notion of this typical use of circumcision. So Philo the Jew says
  (h), that circumcision taught , "the cutting off of all pleasures and
  affections": and elsewhere he says (i): it is a symbol of two things
  particularly; the one is the cutting off of pleasures, as before; and the
  other is the removal of arrogancy, that grievous disease of the soul: and in
  another place (k) he calls purity, or chastity, , "the circumcision of
  circumcision". Now this our apostle says is
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  in the spirit; meaning either the spirit or soul of man, which is the seat and
  subject of it; or the Spirit of God, who is the author of it: the Ethiopic
  version reads it, "by the Holy Ghost":
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  and not in the letter; or "by the letter" of the law; but the Holy Ghost
  produces this spiritual work instrumentally, by the preaching of the Gospel.
  To which the apostle adds,
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  whose praise is not of men, but of God; referring not to circumcision
  immediately spoken of before, but to the Jew who is one inwardly: and alludes
  to the name Judah, from whence the Jews are called, which comes from the word
  which signifies to "praise"; and intimates here, that such persons must not
  expect praise from men, who are only taken, with outward things, but from God,
  who searches and knows the heart.
