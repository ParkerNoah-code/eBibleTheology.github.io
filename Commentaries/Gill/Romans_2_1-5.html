      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter contains, in general, a vindication of the justice and
        equity of the divine procedure against men, such as are described in the
        preceding chapter; and a refutation of the several pleas that might be
        made by the Gentiles, who had not the law, and by the Jews who had it;
        and concludes with exposing the wickedness of the latter, and with
        showing who they are that are properly Jews, and circumcised persons, in
        the account of God. It begins, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#001">Rom 2:1</a>, with an inference
        deduced from what had been said in the latter part of the foregoing
        chapter; concluding that such, be they who they will, Jews or Gentiles,
        are inexcusable, who do the things they condemn others for: but though
        the judgment of such persons is wrong, the apostle observes,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#002">Rom 2:2</a>, that the judgment
        of God, in the condemnation of them, is right, of which he, and others,
        were fully assured; and which judgment is commended, by the rule of it,
        being according to truth; by the objects of it, criminals, who are left
        without excuse, and by the inevitableness of it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#003">Rom 2:3</a>, being such as
        cannot possibly be escaped: and though some men might hope to escape it,
        because not immediately punished, but loaded with the blessings of
        Providence, and peculiar benefits of divine goodness; yet this was to be
        ascribed to the forbearance of God for the present; and that if these
        favours were despised, and they had not a good effect upon them to bring
        to repentance, but instead thereof were more and more hardened under
        them, as their guilt would be increased, so wrath would be secretly
        laying up for them, which will be revealed in the day of judgment,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#004">Rom 2:4</a>, at which time
        justice will be done to every man as his works will be found to be,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#006">Rom 2:6</a>, then follows a
        description of the several sorts of persons that will be judged, and of
        the different things that will be their portion: as that eternal life
        will be given to good men,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#007">Rom 2:7</a>, and the wrath of
        God poured down on bad men, whether they be Jews or Gentiles,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#008">Rom 2:8</a>. The happiness of
        good men is repeated again, and explained, and promised to the Jew
        first, and then to the Gentile,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#010">Rom 2:10</a>, and a reason
        given of this just and equal distribution, taken from the nature of God,
        who is no respecter of persons,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#011">Rom 2:11</a>, an instance of
        which is produced in both Jews and Gentiles, that sin; the one perishing
        with, the other without the law,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012">Rom 2:12</a>, since it is not
        barely having and hearing the law, but acting up to it, which only can
        justify before God,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013">Rom 2:13</a>, upon which the
        apostle proceeds to refute the plea that might be made by the Gentiles,
        in favour of themselves, why they should not be condemned, taken from
        their not having the written law; for though they had not the law
        written on tables of stone, as the Jews had, yet they had, as he
        observes, the law of nature written on their hearts, against which they
        sinned: this he proves by the effects of it, discernible in many of them
        by their outward lives and conversations, in conformity to the law; and
        by the inward testimony of their consciences, approving of good deeds,
        and reproaching for bad ones,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#014">Rom 2:14</a>, which two verses
        being put into a parenthesis,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016">Rom 2:16</a>, is connected
        with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#013">Rom 2:13</a>, and points
        at the time when the doers of the law shall be justified, even at the
        day of judgment: which judgment is described by the author of it, God;
        by the subject of it, the secrets of men's hearts; by the person
        employed in the divine procedure, Jesus Christ; and by the evidence and
        certainty of it, the Gospel preached by the apostle, and then follow a
        description of the Jews, an account of their profession of religion, and
        an ironical concession of the several characters they assumed to
        themselves: they are described by their name, a Jew; by their religion,
        which lay in trusting in the law of Moses, and in boasting of their
        interest in God, as the God of Israel,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#017">Rom 2:17</a>, by their
        knowledge of the will of God, and approbation of the excellent things of
        his law, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#018">Rom 2:18</a>, and by
        the characters they took to themselves,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#019">Rom 2:19</a>, from which the
        apostle takes an occasion to expose the wickedness of some of their
        principal men, even their teachers,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#021">Rom 2:21</a>, by whose wicked
        lives and conversations God was dishonoured, and his name blasphemed
        among the Gentiles,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#023">Rom 2:23</a>, hence it
        appears, that their name, profession, and character, would not justify
        them before God; wherefore the apostle goes on, to remove their plea
        taken from circumcision, showing that could be of no use to them, but
        became void through their breach of the law,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#025">Rom 2:25</a>, and that, on the
        other hand, an uncircumcised Gentile, by keeping the law from right
        principles, and to a right end, appeared to be the true circumcision,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#026">Rom 2:26</a>, wherefore the
        circumcised Jew that broke the law, stood condemned by the uncircumcised
        Gentile that fulfilled it; so far was circumcision from being any part
        of his justification, or a plea in favour of it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#027">Rom 2:27</a>. Then the apostle
        concludes the chapter, by giving a definition of a real Jew, and of true
        circumcision; which he does first negatively, that it is not anything
        external that makes him a Jew, or anything in the flesh that is right
        circumcision; but secondly, positively, that it is an inward work of
        grace that denominates a man a Jew, in a spiritual sense, or an
        Israelite indeed; and that it is the circumcision of the heart, which is
        wrought by the Spirit of God, that is true and genuine: and such a Jew,
        and such a circumcision, are approved of by God, and commended by him,
        when the other have only praise of men,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028">Rom 2:28</a>, and therefore,
        however such persons may be justified before men, they cannot be
        justified in the sight of God; which is the drift and design of the
        apostle in the whole.

      Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man,.... Some think, from the connection
      of these words with the preceding chapter, that the Gentiles are here
      meant; and particularly those among them who seemed to be virtuous, and
      took upon them to be the reprovers of others, and yet did the same things
      themselves, as Socrates, Cato, Seneca, and others; and therefore must be
      inexcusable, because they knew better, and would be thought to have been
      so; wherefore such could never be justified before God by their works, but
      might be justly condemned by him, nor shall they escape his righteous
      judgment. Others think the Jews are meant, who despised and condemned the
      Gentiles, and thought themselves to be righteous persons, and justified in
      the sight of God; and who, though they were secretly guilty of many
      abominable iniquities, yet were very severe upon the sins of others, and
      therefore inexcusable: others think that magistrates are designed, whether
      among Jews or Gentiles, who reprove and punish sin in others, and
      therefore must be supposed to know the law, and the nature of sin, and so
      are inexcusable and self-condemned when they do the same things; wherefore
      though they may pass with impunity among men, they shall not escape the
      judgment of God. Rather the words respect every man, of whatsoever nation,
      office, or place; and may be particularly applied to hypocrites, and seem
      designed to correct censoriousness, and hasty judging, and to throw
      confusion on such who value themselves on being the censurers and
      reprovers of others:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whosoever thou art that judgest; whether a Jew or a Gentile, a public
        magistrate or a private person:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for wherein thou judgest another; that is, in what case or instance; the
        Complutensian edition and the Arabic version read, "in" "or with what
        judgment thou judgest another"; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002">Mat 7:2</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>thou condemnest thyself; by judging them:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for thou that judgest dost the same things; art guilty of the same thing
        condemned in others, and therefore must be self-condemned.

      </p>
      But we are sure that the judgment of God,.... By "the judgment of God", is
      not meant what is exercised on and towards men in this life, but what will
      follow after death; which is called judgment to come, is represented as
      certain, will be universal as to persons and things, and is here called
      "the judgment of God", in opposition to the judgment of men; and because
      it will be carried on by God only, who is omniscient and omnipotent, and
      will be definitive: this is and will be,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to truth, against them which commit such things; in opposition
        to all hypocrisy and unrighteousness: and it may design the law and
        light of nature by which the Gentiles, the law of Moses by which the
        Jews, and the Gospel of Christ by which all have enjoyed the Gospel
        revelation, will be judged; or the truth of their own consciences in
        them all: now we may be sure of this judgment; and of its being
        according to truth, from reason, from Scripture, and from the being and
        perfections of God.

      And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and
      doest the same,.... Some men may be so vain as to imagine, that though
      they do the same things which they condemn in others, they
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall escape the judgment of God: but such will find themselves most
        sadly mistaken; there is no avoiding the general judgment; all men must
        come to it; there will be no eluding it through craftiness and deceit,
        through bribery and corruption; there will be no escaping condign
        punishment, through might in the criminal, or through the judge's
        ignorance of his crimes, or want of ability and power to punish.

      </p>
      Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness,.... The apostle anticipates
      an objection against what he had said, taken from the prosperity of these
      persons; who might conclude from thence, that they were not so wicked as
      he had represented them; and that they should escape the judgment of God,
      otherwise they would have been punished by God in this life, and not have
      prospered as they did; which objection is removed by observing, that it
      was not their innocence, but "the riches of" divine "goodness, and
      longsuffering and forbearance", which were the causes of their prosperity:
      by "the riches of God's goodness", are not meant the riches of his
      special, spiritual, and eternal goodness, which his own people are only
      partakers of: but the general riches of his temporal and providential
      goodness, which the men of the world have commonly the greatest share of;
      they have it in great plenty, which is signified by "riches": and by his
      "longsuffering and forbearance" are designed, not his forbearance of his
      chosen ones and his longsuffering to them, which issue in their salvation;
      but his forbearance of sinners, and longsuffering towards them, in not as
      yet pouring down his wrath and displeasure on them; all which are
      "despised" by them; the riches of his goodness, when he is not glorified
      for his providential mercies, and in them, and when these are abused to
      the lusts of men. The
      <p></p>
      <p>
        forbearance of God is despised, when men on account of it harden
        themselves in sin; and his
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        longsuffering, when they deny his concern in Providence, or a future
        judgment, and promise themselves impunity. Moreover, the apostle
        obviates the above objection by asserting that God's end in his
        goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, was not to testify to their
        innocence, as they imagined, but to lead them to repentance, of which
        they were ignorant;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance. This is
        to be understood not of a spiritual and evangelical repentance, which is
        a free grace gift, and which none but the Spirit of God can lead, or
        bring persons to; but of a natural and legal repentance, which lies in
        an external sorrow for sin, and in an outward cessation from it, and
        reformation of life and manners, which the goodness of God to the Jews
        should have led them to; who had a large share of the good things of
        life, a land flowing with milk and honey, and many outward privileges
        which other nations had not, as the giving of the law, the covenant and
        promises, the word and ordinances; and repentance here chiefly designs,
        as it may respect the Gentiles, a change of mind and practice in them
        relating to idolatry and superstition Now the providential goodness of
        God has a tendency to lead persons to repentance on this account; but of
        this end of divine goodness the Gentiles were ignorant; nor was this end
        answered thereby; which shows the wretched depravity of human nature;
        see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#015">Act 14:15</a>.

      </p>
      But after thy hardness and impenitent heart,.... The apostle goes on to
      show, that such persons who promise themselves impunity on the score of
      prosperity, shall not always go unobserved and unpunished; for there is a
      day of wrath and righteous judgment hastening on, and will take place
      after they have filled up the measure of their iniquity. There is a
      natural "hardness" of the heart in every son and daughter of Adam; and
      there is an acquired habitual hardness, which is increased by sinning; and
      a judicial one, which God, for sin, sometimes gives persons up unto. An
      "impenitent heart" is not only an heart which does not repent, but such an
      one as cannot repent, being harder than the nether millstone. Now men, by
      such hardness and impenitence,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        treasure up unto themselves wrath: they are the authors of their own
        destruction; by which is meant the wrath of God, in opposition to the
        riches of his goodness, despised by them; and is in reserve for wicked
        men: and is laid up
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>against, and will be brought forth in</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the day of wrath; which the Scriptures call "the evil day",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#003">Amo 6:3</a>
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#013">Eph 6:13</a>; the day fixed by
        God, when he will call men to an account for their sins, and stir up all
        his wrath against them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and revelation; that is, the day of revelation, when Christ shall be
        revealed from heaven in flames of fire, the sins of men shall be
        revealed, and the wrath of God against them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        of the righteous judgment of God; so some copies read; that is, the day
        of the righteous judgment; so the Arabic version reads, "and of the
        appearance of God, and of his righteous judgment"; for the judgment will
        be at the appearance of Christ, who is God, and at his kingdom,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#001">Ti2 4:1</a>. The Alexandrian
        copy reads, "and of the retribution of the righteous judgment of God";
        and so the Ethiopic version seems to have read, rendering the words, "if
        so", or "seeing thy retribution may come upon thee", and "if the
        judgment of God may befall thee"; for when the judgment of God shall
        come, as there will be a revelation of men's sins, and of the wrath of
        God against them, there will be a just retribution according to their
        works. Or "the revelation of the righteous judgment of God"; that is,
        when the judgment of God, which is now hid, shall appear; and which is
        said to be "righteous", because it will be carried on in a righteous
        manner, and proceed upon, and be executed according to the strictest
        rules of justice and equity.
