      For I say, through the grace given unto me,.... The Ethiopic version
      reads, the grace of God: and so two of Stephens's copies. By which the
      apostle intends, not that internal grace which was wrought in his soul;
      nor the Gospel of the grace of God, which he preached; nor the gifts of
      grace, which qualified him for that service; but the grace of apostleship,
      or that authoritative power, which he, as the apostle, received from
      Christ to say, command, give orders and instructions to churches, and
      particular persons:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to every man that is among you: every member of the church, in
        whatsoever state or condition, whether in office or not; of whatsoever
        abilities or capacity, having gifts, whether more or less; the
        manifestation of the Spirit being given to everyone to profit with, for
        his own and the good of others:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; that is,
        either not to arrogate to himself what does not belong to him, and
        detract from others, who may have equal, if not superior, abilities to
        him; or not to glory in what he has, as if he had not received it, and
        as if it was altogether owing to his own sagacity, penetration,
        diligence, and industry; or not to search into things too high for him
        that are out of his reach, and beyond his capacity; though this is not
        to be understood as discouraging a search into the Scriptures of truth,
        the more difficult parts of it, and the more knotty points of
        controversy; but as forbidding inquiry into things not lawful to be
        searched into, or, if lawful, as requiring such a scrutiny to be made
        with modesty, and an humble dependence on superior light and assistance,
        and a discovery of it with humility and lowliness of mind;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the
        measure of faith: such ought to consider that what gifts, abilities,
        light, and knowledge they have, they have then, not of themselves, but
        from God; that they have not all faith, and all knowledge, or do not
        know the whole of the faith of the Gospel only a measure of it, which is
        dealt out, divided, and parted to every man, some having a greater
        degree of evangelical light than others; and that all have some, but
        none all. The Syriac version renders it, "faith in measure"; one of
        Stephens's copies reads, "the measure of grace"; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007">Eph 4:7</a>.

      </p>
      For as we have many members in one body,.... The apostle illustrates what
      he said last concerning God's dealing to every man the measure of faith,
      by comparing the church of Christ to an human body, which is but one, and
      has many members in union with it, and one another; and which are placed
      in an exact symmetry and proportion, and in proper subserviency to each
      other, and for the good of the whole:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and all members have not the same office, or "action"; they do not
        exercise the same function, and perform the same operation, but each
        that which is peculiar to itself: the eye only sees, but does not hear,
        nor taste, nor smell; the ear only hears, but neither sees, or does any
        of the aforesaid things; the palate tastes, the nose smells, the hand
        handles, the foot walks, and the same may be observed of the other
        members of the body, which have not the same, but their particular
        offices, and all and each of them their usefulness.

      </p>
      So we being many are one body in Christ,.... This is the application of
      the above simile. The chosen of God, the redeemed of Christ, and those
      that are justified by his righteousness, and sanctified by his Spirit;
      though they are but few in comparison of the men of the world, but
      considered in themselves are many, and yet make up but one body, the
      church, of which Christ is the head: and though this general assembly; or
      church universal, may be distinguished into several congregational
      churches, and distinct communities, yet each community, consisting of
      divers persons, is but one body "in Christ", united and knit together by
      joints and bands, under him their head, Lord, and King; in him, and not in
      Caesar, or any earthly monarch, to distinguish this body from bodies
      politic, or any civil community among men:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and everyone members one of another; as in union with Christ their head,
        so to one another in love, walking in holy fellowship together,
        sympathizing with, and serving each other.

      </p>
      Having then gifts, differing,.... As in a natural body, the various
      members of it have not the same office, and do not perform the same
      actions, thus they have not the same, but different faculties; one has one
      faculty, another another; the eye has the faculty of seeing, the ear of
      hearing, &amp;c. thus in the spiritual body the church, as there are
      different members, these members have not the same work and business
      assigned them; some are employed one way, and some another; also they have
      diversities of gifts for their different administrations and operations,
      and all from Christ their head, by the same Spirit, and for the service of
      the whole body,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        according to the grace that is given unto us; for all these gifts are
        not the effects of nature, the fruits of human power, diligence, and
        industry, but flow from the grace of God, who dispenses them when,
        where, and to whom he pleases in a free and sovereign manner; and
        therefore to be acknowledged as such, and used to his glory, and for the
        good of his church and people. Wherefore
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith.
        The offices here, and hereafter mentioned, are not of an extraordinary,
        but ordinary kind, such as are lasting, and will continue in the church
        unto the end of time: and are divided into two parts, which are after
        subdivided into other branches. The division is into "prophesying" and
        "ministering". By "prophesying" is meant, not foretelling things to
        come, thought this gift was bestowed upon some, as Agabus, and others in
        the Christian church; but this, as it is of an extraordinary nature, so
        it is not stinted and limited according to the proportion of faith; but
        preaching the Gospel is here designed, which is the sense of the word in
        many places of Scripture, particularly in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#002">Co1 13:2</a>. Now such who
        have this gift of prophecy, or of opening and explaining the Scriptures,
        ought to make use of it, and constantly attend toil: "let us prophesy";
        diligently prepare for it by prayer, reading and meditation, and
        continually exercise it as opportunity offers; nor should any difficulty
        and discouragement deter from it: or whereas this last clause is not in
        the original text, it may be supplied from
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003">Rom 12:3</a>; thus, "let us
        think soberly", who have this gift, and not be elated with it, or carry
        it haughtily to those who attend on the exercise of it: but behave with
        sobriety, modesty, and humility, in the discharge thereof: "according to
        the proportion of faith". There must be faith, or no prophesying; a man
        must believe, and therefore speak, or speak not at all; a Gospel
        minister ought not to be a sceptic, or in doubt about the main
        principles of religion; such as concern the three divine persons, the
        office, grace, and righteousness of Christ, and the way of salvation by
        him: he should be at a point in these things, should firmly believe, and
        with assurance assert them, nor fear to be called dogmatical on that
        account: he is to preach according to his faith, the proportion of it:
        which may be the same with the measure of it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#003">Rom 12:3</a>. And so the
        Syriac version reads it, , "according to the measure of his faith"; to
        which the Arabic version agrees; that is, according to the measure of
        the gift of Christ he has received; according to the abilities bestowed
        on him; according to that light, knowledge, faith, and experience he
        has; he ought to preach up unto it, and not in the least come short of
        it; or by "the proportion", or "analogy of faith", may be meant a scheme
        of Gospel truths, a form of sound words, a set of principles upon the
        plan of the Scriptures, deduced from them, and agreeably to them; and
        which are all of a piece, and consistent with themselves, from which the
        prophesier or preacher should never swerve: or the Scriptures
        themselves, the sure word of prophecy, the rule and standard of faith
        and practice: the scope of the text is to be attended to, its connection
        with the preceding or following verses, or both; and it is to be
        compared with other passages of Scripture, and accordingly to be
        explained: and this is to follow the rule directed to.

      </p>
      Or ministry, let us wait on our ministry,.... The word sometimes signifies
      the whole ecclesiastical ministry, even the office of apostleship, as well
      as the ordinary ministration of the Gospel; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#017">Act 1:17</a>; but here
      "deaconship", or the office of ministering to the poor saints, as in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#001">Act 6:1</a>, being a distinct
      office from prophesying: or preaching the word, and should be used,
      exercised, and attended to with diligence, care, and constancy; for such
      who are appointed to this office, are chosen not only to a place of
      honour, but of service and business, in which they should behave with
      prudence, sobriety, and humility:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        or he that teacheth, on teaching. The gift of prophesying or preaching
        is subdivided into "teaching" and "exhorting"; the one belongs to
        "teachers" or doctors, the other to "pastors"; as the distinction is in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011">Eph 4:11</a>, not that
        different officers and offices are intended, but different branches of
        the same office; and one man's talent may lie more in the one, and
        another man's in the other; and accordingly each should in his preaching
        attend to the gift which is most peculiar to him: if his gift lies in
        teaching, let him constantly employ himself in that with all sobriety
        and "teaching" does not design an office in the school, but in the
        church; it is not teaching divinity as men teach logic, rhetoric, and
        other arts and sciences, in the schools; but an instructing of churches
        and the members thereof in the doctrines of the Gospel, in order to
        establish and build them up in their most holy faith; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028">Co1 12:28</a>; it chiefly lies
        in a doctrinal way of preaching, in opening, explaining, and defending
        the doctrines of Christ, as distinct from the practical part of the
        ministry of the word, and the administration of ordinances, in which the
        pastor is employed as well as in this.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008">Romans 12:8</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="margnote"

            ><a name="an_008">rom 12:8</a></font
          ></span
        >
      </p>
      Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation,.... This is the other branch of
      prophesying or preaching, and which is more practical, and lies in giving
      a word of exhortation to the saints, as their particular cases call for;
      for as prophets were teachers,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001">Act 13:1</a>; so also exhorters,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#032">Act 15:32</a>; and one
      considerable branch of the ministry, and which is more principally the
      pastor's work, as well as to teach, is to exhort all sorts of persons,
      young and old, rich and poor, high and low, bond and free, under his care,
      with all longsuffering and doctrine. The words will bear to be read, "he
      that comforteth, on consolation"; and so the Syriac version renders them,
      , "and another who is a comforter, in his consolation". Though all the
      ministers of the Gospel are to speak comfortably to the saints, by
      preaching the doctrines of free justification by Christ's righteousness,
      and remission of sins by his blood, by bringing the good news of salvation
      by him, and by opening the exceeding great and precious promises of the
      Gospel; yet some have a greater talent this way than others; some are
      "Boanergeses", sons of thunder (Mar 3:17) and others
      "Barnabases", sons of consolation,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#036">Act 4:36</a>; and each should
      attend to that with all diligence and humility, he is best qualified for.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. Here begins the
        subdivision of the deacon's office into its several branches, "giving",
        "ruling", and "showing mercy": by "giving" is meant, not giving of his
        own, or performing: acts of charity, which is common to all the members
        of the church, who ought liberally to contribute to the relief of the
        poor; but imparting or distributing the church's money to proper
        objects, which is to be done "with simplicity"; with all faithfulness
        and integrity, without fraud or embezzling the church's stock, with
        impartiality, and without respect of persons, and liberally and
        bountifully, as the word here used signifies; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002">Co2 8:2</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he that ruleth, with diligence; deacons are the "helps, governments",
        mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028">Co1 12:28</a>,
        who are assisting to the pastor in the government of the church; their
        business is, to observe the conversations of the members of the church,
        and to warn them that are unruly and walk disorderly, to compose
        differences, and prepare matters to lay before the church; a deacon is
        "one that goes before"; and leads on others by way of example in his
        conduct and conversation; or as the Syriac renders it, , "that stands at
        the head" of affairs in the church; in the management of which he ought
        to use all study, thoughtfulness, care and diligence:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness; which is not to be understood
        of showing compassion to miserable objects in common, or of giving alms
        to necessitous persons, and which ought to be done according to the
        Jewish (l) canons, , "with a cheerful countenance"; and is what is
        highly pleasing to God, who "loves a cheerful giver": but of a branch of
        the deacon's office, whose work, among other things, is to visit the
        sick and distressed, and communicate to them as their wants require; all
        which should be done, not in a morose and frowning manner, but with a
        pleasant look and cheerful countenance, which makes the visit and the
        gift more welcome, acceptable, and useful.
