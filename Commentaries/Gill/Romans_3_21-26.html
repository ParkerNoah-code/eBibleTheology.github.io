      But now the righteousness of God,.... The apostle having proved that all
      men are unrighteous, and that no man can be justified in the sight of God
      by his obedience, either to the law of nature or of Moses, proceeds to
      give an account of that righteousness, which does justify before God; and
      so returns to his former subject,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Rom 1:17</a>, concerning "the
      righteousness of God", the revelation of which he makes to be peculiar to
      the Gospel, as he does here; since he says, that it
      <p></p>
      <p>
        without the law is manifested: meaning, either that this righteousness
        is without the law, and the deeds of it, as performed by sinful men; or
        that the manifestation of it is without the law, either of nature or of
        Moses; for the law discovers sin, but not a righteousness which
        justifies from sin; it shows what righteousness is, but does not direct
        the sinner where there is one to be had, that will make him righteous in
        the sight of God: this is made known without the law, and only in the
        Gospel:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        being witnessed by the law and the prophets; a testimony is borne to the
        justifying righteousness of Christ both "by the law", particularly in
        the five books of Moses; which testify of Christ, of his obedience,
        sufferings, and death, by which he brought in life and righteousness;
        see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</a>, compared with
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24</a>; and
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006">Gen 15:6</a> with
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009">Rom 4:9</a>; and
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018">Gen 22:18</a> with

      Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ,.... A
      further account is given of this righteousness: why it is called "the
      righteousness of God", and in what sense revealed and manifested; see Gill
      on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Rom 1:17</a>; Here it is said to
      be "by faith of Jesus Christ"; not by that faith which Christ himself had
      as man, but by that faith, of which he the author and object: the
      Alexandrian copy reads, "by faith in Jesus Christ"; and not by that as the
      cause of justification; for faith is neither the efficient, nor the
      moving, nor meritorious cause of it; no, nor the instrumental cause of it
      on the part of God or Christ: nor is faith the matter of a justifying
      righteousness; for faith is a part of sanctification, is itself imperfect,
      is a man's own, as it is implanted in him, and exercised by him; is here
      and elsewhere distinguished from righteousness; something else, and not
      that, as the obedience and blood of Christ, are said to be what men are
      made righteous and justified by: but faith is a means of apprehending and
      receiving righteousness; it views the excellency of Christ's
      righteousness; it owns the sufficiency of it; the soul by it renounces its
      own righteousness, submits to Christ's, rejoices in it, and gives him the
      glory of it: now this is by, or through faith,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        unto all, and upon all: not all men, for all have not faith, nor are all
        justified and saved: but
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        all that believe; which must be understood, not of believing any thing,
        nor of any sort of believing; but of such, who truly and with the heart
        believe in Christ for salvation; and who are here opposed to the wise
        philosophers among the Gentiles, had to all self-righteous persons among
        the Jews. Though this character does not design any cause or condition
        of justification, but is only descriptive of the persons, who are
        declaratively interested in a justifying righteousness, which is said to
        be "unto", and "upon them"; that is, it is appointed, provided, and
        wrought out for them, and directed and applied unto them, and put upon
        them as a garment, and that upon all of them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for there is no difference; of nation, age, or sex, or of state and
        condition; no respect is had to persons or works; nor is there any
        difference with respect to weak or strong believers; the righteousness
        is equally applied to one as to another, and one is as much justified by
        it in the sight of God as another.

      </p>
      For all have sinned,.... This is the general character of all mankind; all
      have sinned in Adam, are guilty by his sin, polluted with it, and
      condemned for it; all are sinners in themselves, and by their own actual
      transgressions; this is the case of the whole world, and of all the men in
      it; not only of the Gentiles, but of the Jews, and the more righteous
      among them: hence there is no difference in the state and condition of men
      by nature; nor is there any reason from and in themselves, why God saves
      one and not another; nor any room to despair of the grace and
      righteousness of Christ, on account of persons being, in their own view,
      the worst of sinners:
      <p></p>
      <p>and hence it is, that they are all</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        come short of the glory of God; either of glorifying of God; man was
        made for this purpose, and was capable of it, though now through sin
        incapable; and it is only by the grace of God that he is enabled to do
        it: or of glorying: before him; sin has made him infamous, and is his
        shame; by it he has forfeited all external favours, and has nothing of
        his own to glory in; his moral righteousness is no foundation for
        boasting, especially before God: or of having glory from God; the most
        pure and perfect creature does not of itself deserve any glory and
        praise from God; good men, in a way of grace, will have praise of God;
        but sinners can never expect any on their own account: or of the
        glorious grace of God, as sanctifying and pardoning grace, and
        particularly the grace of a justifying righteousness; man has no
        righteousness, nor can he work out one; nor will his own avail, he wants
        a better than that: or of eternal glory; which may be called the glory
        of God, because it is of his preparing, what he calls persons to by his
        grace, and which of his own free grace he bestows upon them, and will
        chiefly lie in the enjoyment of him; now this is represented sometimes
        as a prize, which is run for, and pressed after; but men, through
        sinning, come short of it, and must of themselves do so for ever: or
        rather of the image of God in man, who is called "the image and glory of
        God",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007">Co1 11:7</a>, which consisted
        externally in government over the creatures; internally, in
        righteousness and holiness, in wisdom and knowledge, in the bias of his
        mind to that which is good, and in power to perform it; of all which he
        is come short, or deprived by sinning.

      Being justified freely by his grace,.... The matter of justification is
      before expressed, and the persons that share in this blessing are
      described; here the several causes of it are mentioned. The moving cause
      of it is the free grace of God; for by "the grace of God" here, is not
      meant the Gospel, or what some men call the terms of the Gospel, and the
      constitution of it; nor the grace of God infused into the heart; but the
      free love and favour of God, as it is in his heart; which is wonderfully
      displayed in the business of a sinner's justification before him: it
      appears in his resolving upon the justification of his chosen ones in
      Christ; in fixing on the method of doing it; in setting forth and
      pre-ordaining Christ to be the ransom; in calling Christ to engage herein;
      in Christ's engaging as a surety for his people, and in the Father's
      sending him to bring in everlasting righteousness; in Christ's coming to
      do it, and in the gracious manner in which he wrought it out; in the
      Father's gracious acceptation, imputation, and donation of it; in the free
      gift of the grace of faith, to apprehend and receive it; and in the
      persons that partake of it, who are of themselves sinners and ungodly. The
      meritorious cause of justification is,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: redemption supposes a former
        state of captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were
        by nature, and is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature,
        chiefly respects the soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal: this
        is in and by Christ; he was called unto it, was sent to effect it, had a
        right unto it, as being the near kinsman; and was every way fit for it,
        being both God and man; and has by his sufferings and death obtained it:
        now, as all the blessings of grace come through redemption by Christ, so
        does this of justification, and after this manner; Christ, as a
        Redeemer, had the sins of his people laid on him, and they were bore by
        him, and took away; the sentence of the law's condemnation was executed
        on him, as standing in their legal place and stead; and satisfaction was
        made by him for all offences committed by them, which was necessary,
        that God might appear to be just, in justifying all them that believe:
        nor is this any objection or contradiction to the free grace of God, in
        a sinner's justification; since it was grace in God to provide, send,
        and part with his Son as a Redeemer, and to work out righteousness; it
        was grace in Christ, to come and give himself a sacrifice, and obtain
        salvation and righteousness, not for angels, but for men, and for some
        of them, and not all; and whatever this righteousness, salvation, and
        redemption cost Christ, they are all free to men.

      Whom God had set forth to be a propitiation,.... Redemption by Christ is
      here further explained, by his being "a propitiation": which word may
      design either Christ the propitiator, the author of peace and
      reconciliation; or the propitiatory sacrifice, by which he is so; and both
      in allusion to the mercy seat, which was a type of him as such. The
      apostle here uses the same word, which the Septuagint often render "the
      mercy seat", by; and Philo the Jew calls it by the same name, and says it
      was a symbol, "of the propitious power of God" (b). Christ is the
      propitiation to God for sin; which must be understood of his making
      satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people; these were
      imputed to him, and being found on him, the law and justice of God made
      demands on him for them; which he answered to satisfaction, by his
      obedience and sacrifice; and which, as it could not be done by any other,
      nor in any other way, is expressed by "reconciliation", and "atonement":
      whence God may be said to be pacified, or made propitious; not but that he
      always loved his people, and never hated them; nor is there, nor can there
      be any change in God, from hatred to love, any more than from love to
      hatred: Christ has not, by his sacrifice and death, procured the love and
      favour of God, but has removed the obstructions which lay in the way of
      love's appearing and breaking forth; there was, a law broken, and justice
      provoked, which were to be attended to, and Christ by his sacrifice has
      satisfied both; so that neither the wrath of God, nor any of the effects
      of it, can fall upon the persons Christ is the propitiation for, even
      according to justice itself; so that it is not love, but justice that is
      made propitious: for this is all owing to the grace and goodness of God,
      who "hath set him forth", for this intent, in his eternal purposes and
      decrees; in the promises of the Old Testament, in the types, shadows, and
      sacrifices of the old law; by the exhibition of him in our nature, and in
      the ministration of the Gospel; and this is said to be
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through faith in his blood. The "blood" of Christ is that, by which
        Christ is the propitiation; for without the shedding of that blood,
        there is no redemption, no peace, no reconciliation, or remission of
        sin; and "faith" in his blood is the means by which persons become
        partakers of the benefits of his propitiation; such as peace, pardon,
        atonement, justification, and adoption: and the end of Christ's being
        set forth as a propitiation, on the part of God's people, is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God:
        by "sins that are past", are meant, not sins before baptism, nor the
        sins of a man's life only, but the sins of Old Testament saints, who
        lived before the incarnation of Christ, and the oblation of his
        sacrifice; and though this is not to be restrained to them only, for
        Christ's blood was shed for the remission of all his people's sins,
        past, present, and to come; yet the sins of the saints before the coming
        of Christ, seem to be particularly designed; which shows the
        insufficiency of legal sacrifices, sets forth the efficacy of Christ's
        blood and sacrifice, demonstrates him to be a perfect Saviour, and gives
        us reason under the present dispensation to hope for pardon, since
        reconciliation is completely made: "remission" of sin does not design
        that weakness which sin has brought upon, and left in human nature,
        whereby it is so enfeebled, that it cannot help itself, and therefore
        Christ was set forth, and sent forth, to be a propitiation; but rather
        God's passing by, or overlooking sin, and not punishing for it, under
        the former dispensation; or else the forgiveness of it now, and
        redemption from it by the blood of Christ, "through the forbearance of
        God"; in deferring the execution of justice, till he sent his Son, and
        in expecting satisfaction of his Son; which shows the grace and goodness
        of God to his people, and the trust and confidence he put in his Son:
        the other end on the part of God, in setting forth Christ to be a
        propitiation, was
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to declare his righteousness
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031">Psa 22:31</a>; meaning either
        the righteousness of Christ, which was before hid, but now manifested;
        or rather the righteousness of God the Father, his faithfulness in his
        promises relating to Christ, his grace and goodness in the mission of
        his Son, the holiness and purity of his nature, and his vindictive
        justice, in avenging sin in his own Son, as the surety of his people:
        the execution of this was threatened from the beginning; the types and
        sacrifices of the old law prefigured it; the prophecies of the Old
        Testament express it; and the sufferings and death of Christ openly
        declare it, since God spared not his own Son, but sheathed the sword of
        justice in him.

      </p>
      To declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness,.... This end is
      further explained, it being to declare the righteousness of God "at this
      time", under the Gospel dispensation; in which there was such a display of
      the grace, mercy, and goodness of God:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that he might be just; that is, appear to be so: God is naturally and
        essentially just in himself; and he is evidentially so in all his works,
        particularly in redemption by Christ; and when and while he is
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus: Jesus, the Saviour, is the
        object of faith, as he is the Lord our righteousness; the believer in
        Jesus is a real, and not a nominal one; God is the justifier of such in
        a declarative way, and God only, though not to the exclusion of the Son
        and Spirit; and which sentence of justification is pronounced by him on
        the foot of a perfect righteousness, which neither law nor justice can
        find fault with, but entirely approve of; and so he appears just and
        righteous, even though he justifies the sinner and the ungodly.
