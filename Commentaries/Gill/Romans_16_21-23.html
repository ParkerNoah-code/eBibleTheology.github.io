      Timotheus my work fellow,.... Now follow the salutations of the friends
      and companions of the apostle: we may imagine that when this epistle was
      just concluding, that these his friends being about him, one said, pray
      send my Christian salutation to our dear friends at Rome, so said a
      second, and likewise a third, and so on, and Timotheus he began. This is
      the same person with Timothy, a disciple the apostle met with at Derbe,
      whose father was a Greek, and his mother a Jewess, and a believer in
      Christ. This same man he circumcised because of the Jews, and took him
      along with him, and was his companion in his travels, and very assisting
      to him in the work of the ministry, in spreading the Gospel, and promoting
      the interest of Jesus Christ; and therefore he here calls him his "work
      fellow"; he wrote two epistles to him afterwards when at a distance front
      him, in which he often calls him his son, his dear and well beloved son,
      having a great affection for him, because as a son with a father he served
      with him in the Gospel of Christ:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen salute you. This Lucius
        was either Lucius of Cyrene, who was one of the prophets in the church
        at Antioch (Act 13:1) though indeed he
        is never said to travel with the apostle, or to be at Corinth, from
        whence this epistle was written; or rather, therefore, as others think,
        Luke the evangelist, who was a constant companion of the apostle, and
        was at Corinth with him at this time, as appears from
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#005">Act 20:5</a>; Jason no doubt
        is he of Thessalonica, that received Paul and Silas into his house, and
        when an uproar was made concerning them, was brought before the rulers
        of the city, and gave security for them,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#005">Act 17:5</a>. This is a Jewish
        name, and he himself was a Jew, as is clear from his being a kinsman of
        the apostle's; his name was "Jeshua" or "Jesus"; so we read of one
        Jason, the brother of Onias the high priest of the Jews,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took
        the kingdom,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,'' (2
        Maccabees 4:7)
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and whose name, as Josephus (a) relates, was Jesus, but he chose to be
        called Jason, very likely because that was a name among the Greeks,
        whose fashions he was fond of. Sosipater was Sopater of Berea, who, with
        others, accompanied the apostle into Asia,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004">Act 20:4</a>; he also was a
        Jew, and his Jewish name, as Grotius conjectures, might be Abisha, or
        rather Abishua, the name of the son of Phinehas the high priest,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1006.htm#004">Ch1 6:4</a>. Mention is also
        made of one of this name, Sosipater, in
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"12. Howbeit Dositheus and</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus' captains, went forth, and slew those
        that Timotheus had left in the fortress, above ten thousand men. 24.
        Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with his life,
        because he had many of the Jews' parents, and the brethren of some of
        them, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded.'' (2
        Maccabees 12:12,24)
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        These three last were Paul's kinsmen after the flesh, as well as in the
        spirit; being of the same nation, and perhaps of the same tribe, and it
        may be of the same family; they are all three mentioned among the
        severity disciples: Lucius is said to be bishop of Laodicea in Syria,
        Jason of Tarsus, and Sosipater of Iconium; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>.

      I Tertius, who wrote this epistle,.... This name is a Latin one, and
      perhaps the person might be a Roman, for the names Secundus, Tertius,
      Quartus, Quintus, &amp;c. were common with the Romans; unless it may be
      thought, as it is by some, that this man was the same with Silas, who was
      a constant companion of the apostle; and the Hebrew word is the same as
      Tertius; he also is numbered among the seventy disciples, and said to be
      bishop of Iconium; See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>. Whosoever he was,
      it is certain he was an amanuensis of the apostle, who wrote this letter,
      either from the apostle's notes, or from his mouth.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Salute you in the Lord. Some connect this phrase, "in the Lord", with
        the other, "wrote this epistle", and make the sense to be that he wrote
        this epistle for the Lord's sake, for his honour and glory; which he
        might do, though he wrote it not by inspiration, being only scribe to
        the apostle; but it is better connected with the word "salute", and the
        sense is, that his salutation was not a mere form, nor only concerned
        their temporal good, but their spiritual welfare; that he wished them
        well in the Lord, that they might have much communion with him, and
        larger measures of grace from him.

      Gaius mine host,.... There was one Gaius a Macedonian, that was with the
      apostle at Ephesus,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029">Act 19:29</a>; and another Gaius
      of Derbe, that accompanied him into Asia,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004">Act 20:4</a>; whether either of
      these, as the latter seems more probable, was this person, is not certain.
      However, it seems very likely that it is the same Gaius the apostle
      baptized at Corinth,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#014">Co1 1:14</a>; and some have
      thought him to be the same that the Apostle John wrote his third epistle
      to, and indeed the characters of hospitality and generosity there given
      him well agree with this, who was not only the apostle's host that
      entertained him in a kind and liberal manner, but of all the saints:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and of the whole church, saluteth you; that is, of the church at
        Corinth, to whom he was kind and hospitable, even to as many as stood in
        need of his assistance; or of the church of Christ in general, being
        beneficent and liberal to all Christian strangers that came that way,
        lodged them at his house, and provided every thing proper and convenient
        for them. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that there was a public hospital or
        receptacle for strangers at Corinth, in imitation of the Jews, who had a
        place adjoining to their synagogues to entertain travellers in; and that
        Gaius was the chief officer and overseer of this house, who, discharging
        his trust well, is deservedly commended. That the Jews had places near
        their synagogues for such a purpose is, certain. It is said (b),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "why do they sanctify (or consecrate the day?) that travellers may do
        their duty, who eat, and drink, and sleep in the synagogue.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The gloss on it is,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "not the synagogue itself, but the chambers which were near the
        synagogue, are called the synagogue, and from thence they heard the
        consecration.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And elsewhere (c) it is said,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "in the synagogues they neither eat nor drink--but there is a place near
        the synagogue where travellers used to sleep and eat;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and then follows what is said before. And Maimonides (d) observes,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "there is no sanctification (of the sabbath) but in the place where the
        meal is eaten; so a man may not sanctify in one house, and eat in
        another; but if he sanctifies in this, he must eat in this; but why do
        they sanctify in the synagogue? because of travellers who eat and drink
        there.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Upon which his commentator remarks (e), that</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "they do not eat in the synagogue at all, but they eat, , "in a house
        near the synagogue", where they sit at the time of hearing the
        sanctification.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But whether there was such an house at Corinth near the place of public
        worship, or any where else for this purpose, is not certain; and to make
        Gains only an overseer over such an house, though a faithful one,
        greatly sinks his character; since one would conclude from hence, that
        his entertainment of the apostle, and other saints, was at his own
        expense.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you; whom the apostle is
        said to leave at Corinth (Ti2 4:20) and at another
        time to send along with Timotheus into Macedonia, if the same person is
        intended; for these do not seem so well to accord with his being in such
        an office, which must require attendance, and would not admit of going
        from place to place with the apostle, or of being sent by him. The city,
        of which he was chamberlain, was the city of Corinth, where the apostle
        and this Erastus were, when this epistle was wrote. The word translated
        "chamberlain", is often used for a steward; and here it signifies such
        an officer as had the care of the city chest or coffer, and distributed
        the public money; and seems to answer to the "quaestor urbanus", or city
        treasurer, among the Romans, whose business it was to receive the city
        accounts, and disburse at all occasions of public expenses; so that this
        was a place of honour and trust; hence it appears, that though not many,
        yet some rich and honourable were called by grace, and embraced the
        Gospel. His name signifies beloved, and is the same with David in
        Hebrew. What nation he was of is not certain, whether a Roman, a Greek,
        or Jew; one of this name is reckoned among the seventy disciples, and it
        said to be bishop of Paneas, or of the Philippians; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Quartus a brother; not of Tertius, nor of Erastus, nor of the apostle
        according to the flesh, as some have thought, but a brother in a
        spiritual relation. This man, as appears from his name, was a Roman;
        probably had before lived at Rome, and therefore sends his salutations
        to the Christians there: he is mentioned among the seventy disciples,
        and said to be bishop of Berytus; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>.
