      For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ,.... The reason why he was so
      ready and willing to preach it, even where he ran the greatest risk of his
      character and life, was, because it was "the Gospel of Christ" he
      preached, and he was not ashamed of it. This supposes that some were,
      though the apostle was not, ashamed of the Gospel; as all such are who
      hide and conceal it, who have abilities to preach it, and do not: or who
      preach, but not the Gospel; or who preach the Gospel only in part, who own
      that in private, they will not preach in public, and use ambiguous words,
      of doubtful signification, to cover themselves; who blend the Gospel with
      their own inventions, seek to please men, and live upon popular applause,
      regard their own interest, and not Christ's, and cannot bear the reproach
      of his Gospel. It expresses, that the apostle was not ashamed of it; that
      is, to preach it, which he did fully and faithfully, plainly and
      consistently, openly and publicly, and boldly, in the face of all
      opposition: and it designs more than is expressed, as that he had the
      utmost value for it, and esteemed it his highest honour that he was
      employed in preaching it: his reasons for this were, because it was "the
      Gospel of Christ"; which Christ himself preached, which he had learnt by
      revelation from him, and of which he was the sum and substance: and
      because
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it is the power of God; not essentially, but declaratively; as the power
        of God is seen in making men ministers of it, in the doctrines held
        forth in it, in the manner in which it was spread in the world, in the
        opposition it met with, in the continuance and increase of it
        notwithstanding the power and cunning of men, and in the shortness of
        time, in which so much good was done by it in the several parts of the
        world: it is the power of God organically or instrumentally; as it is a
        means made use of by God in quickening dead sinners, enlightening blind
        eyes, unstopping deaf ears, softening hard hearts, and making of enemies
        friends; to which add, the manner in which all this is done, suddenly,
        secretly, effectually, and by love, and not force: the extent of this
        power is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        unto salvation; the Gospel is a declaration and revelation of salvation
        by Christ, and is a means of directing and encouraging souls to lay hold
        upon it. The persons to whom it is so, are in general,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        everyone that believeth: this does not suppose that faith gives the
        Gospel its virtue and efficacy; but is only descriptive of the persons
        to whom the Gospel, attended with the power and grace of God, is
        eventually efficacious: and particularly it was so,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to the Jew first; who as they had formerly the advantage of the
        Gentiles, much every way, through the peculiar privileges which were
        conferred on them; so the Gospel was first preached to them by Christ
        and his disciples; and even when it was ordered to be carried into the
        Gentile world, it was to begin with them, and became effectual for the
        salvation of many of them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and also to the Greek; to the Gentile; for after the Jews had rejected
        it, as many being called by it as Jehovah thought fit, at that time, it
        was preached to the Gentiles with great success; which was the mystery
        hid from ages and generations past, but now made manifest.

      For therein is the righteousness of God revealed,.... By "the
      righteousness of God", is not meant the essential righteousness of God,
      the rectitude of his nature, his righteousness in fulfilling his promises,
      and his punitive justice, which though revealed in the Gospel, yet not
      peculiar to it; nor the righteousness by which Christ himself is
      righteous, either as God, or as Mediator; but that righteousness which he
      wrought out by obeying the precepts, and bearing the penalty of the law in
      the room of his people, and by which they are justified in the sight of
      God: and this is called "the righteousness of God", in opposition to the
      righteousness of men: and because it justifies men in the sight of God;
      and because of the concern which Jehovah, Father, Son, and Spirit, have in
      it. Jehovah the Father sent his Son to work it out, and being wrought out,
      he approves and accepts of it, and imputes it to his elect: Jehovah the
      Son is the author of it by his obedience and death; and Jehovah the Spirit
      discovers it to sinners, works faith in them to lay hold upon it, and
      pronounces the sentence of justification by it in their consciences. Now
      this is said to be "revealed" in the Gospel, that is, it is taught in the
      Gospel; that is the word of righteousness, the ministration of it; it is
      manifested in and by the Gospel. This righteousness is not known by the
      light of nature, nor by the law of Moses; it was hid under the shadows of
      the ceremonial law, and is brought to light only by the Gospel; it is hid
      from every natural man, even from the most wise and prudent, and from
      God's elect themselves before conversion, and is only made known to
      believers, to whom it is revealed:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        from faith to faith; that is, as say some, from the faith of God to the
        faith of men; from the faith of preachers to the faith of hearers; from
        the faith of the Old to the faith of the New Testament saints; or rather
        from one degree of faith to another; for faith, as it grows and
        increases, has clearer sights of this righteousness, as held forth in
        the Gospel. For the proof of this, a passage of Scripture is cited,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as it is written, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004">Hab 2:4</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the just shall live by faith: "a just", or righteous man is, not
        everyone who thinks himself, or is thought by others to be so; nor are
        any so by their obedience to the law of works; but he is one that is
        made righteous by the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, which is
        before said to be revealed in the Gospel. The life which this man lives,
        and "shall live", does not design a natural or corporeal life, and a
        continuance of that, for such die a natural death, as other men; nor an
        eternal life, for though they shall so live, yet not by faith; but a
        spiritual life, a life of justification on Christ, of holiness from him,
        of communion with him, and of peace and joy; which spiritual life shall
        be continued, and never be lost. The manner in which the just lives, is
        "by faith". In the prophet Habakkuk, the words are, "the just shall
        live" "by his faith"
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004">Hab 2:4</a>); which the
        Septuagint render, "by my faith": and the apostle only reads, "by
        faith", omitting the affix, as well known, and easy to be supplied: for
        faith, when given by God, and exercised by the believer, is his own, and
        by it he lives; not upon it, but by it upon Christ the object of it;
        from whom, in a way of believing, he derives his spiritual life, and all
        the comforts of it.
