      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        The apostle having discoursed of justification and sanctification, and
        of the privileges of justified and sanctified ones, proceeds to treat of
        predestination, the source and spring of all the blessings of grace; and
        to observe how this distinguishing act of God's sovereign will has taken
        place, both among Jews and Gentiles; in treating of which, he knew he
        should go contrary to the sense of his countrymen the Jews, who have a
        notion that all Israel shall have a part in, or inherit the world to
        come (q): and that the Gentiles will be for ever miserable; and nothing
        was more disagreeable to them, than to talk of their rejection of God,
        and the calling of the Gentiles; wherefore that it might be manifest,
        that it was not out of pique and ill will to them, that the apostle said
        the things hereafter related; he expresses the most cordial affection to
        them imaginable, and which he introduces in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001">Rom 9:1</a>, by way of appeal
        to Christ, who knew the truth of what he was about to say, and who
        could, together with the Spirit of God and his own conscience, testify
        for him that it was no lie: the thing he appeals for the truth of, is in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002">Rom 9:2</a>, that the
        salvation of the Jews lay near his heart; that it was no pleasure to him
        to think or speak of their rejection, but was what gave him continual
        pain and uneasiness: and his great desire for their good is expressed in
        a very strong and uncommon manner,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Rom 9:3</a>, the reasons of it
        are partly the relation they stood in to him, being his brethren and
        kinsmen; and partly the many privileges they had been favoured with of
        God; an enumeration of which is given,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004">Rom 9:4</a>, and foreseeing an
        objection, he prevents it, which might be made, that if the Jews were
        cast off, the promise of God to that people that he would be their God,
        would become void, and the preaching the Gospel of Christ to them of no
        effect; to which he answers by distinguishing between Israel and Israel,
        or the elect of God among them, and those that were not; wherefore
        though the latter were rejected according to the purpose of God, the
        promise and preaching of the word had their effect in the former,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#006">Rom 9:6</a>, and that there
        was such a distinction, he proves from the two sons of Abraham, Isaac
        and Ishmael, who were both Abraham's seed; yet one was a child of
        promise, and the other a child of the flesh, and were emblematical of
        the children of the promise, and the children of the flesh among that
        people; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#007">Rom 9:7</a>, and
        further confirms this by the instance of Jacob and Esau, who were born
        of the same parents, and were twins; and yet one was in the favour of
        God, and the other not; and that this was owing not to works, but to the
        sovereign will of God in election, he proves by observing that this was
        before good or evil were done by either of them,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011">Rom 9:11</a>, and that this
        was notified to Rebekah before,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#012">Rom 9:12</a>, as appears from
        a passage in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#023">Gen 25:23</a>,
        and by another passage in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002">Mal 1:2</a>, which is cited,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#013">Rom 9:13</a>, then an
        objection is started,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#014">Rom 9:14</a>, that if God
        loves one, and hates another, both being in equal circumstances, as
        Jacob and Esau were, he must be guilty of unrighteousness; which he
        answers and removes, first by a detestation of such a charge against
        God, and then by producing testimonies out of the books of Moses,
        proving both election and reprobation, as being not of the works of men,
        but of the will of God; the former of these he proves,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#015">Rom 9:15</a>, from
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#019">Exo 33:19</a>, by which it
        appears, that the choice of men to salvation is not according to the
        will of man, but according to the grace and love of God,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016">Rom 9:16</a>, the latter he
        proves by the case of Pharaoh,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#017">Rom 9:17</a>, and the
        Scripture relating to that,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#016">Exo 9:16</a>, and from both
        testimonies concludes,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#018">Rom 9:18</a>, that God's
        having mercy on one, and hardening another, are according to his
        sovereign will and pleasure; then another objection rises, up, if so,
        God has no reason to find fault with men that are hardened in sin, since
        they are according to his will, and in sinning do but fulfil it, and
        which no man resists; and this objection is formed in a very pert and
        sneering manner, and insinuates that God is cruel and acts unreasonably,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#019">Rom 9:19</a>, to which he
        answers, by putting the objector in mind that he was a man, a mere
        creature that started it, and that it was God against whom it was made;
        and by observing the folly and madness of replying against God, and the
        absurdity of such a procedure, taken from the consideration of the one
        being a creature, and the other the Creator,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020">Rom 9:20</a>, and by
        instancing in the case of the potter, who has power over his clay, to
        form it in what shape, and for what use he pleases,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021">Rom 9:21</a>, and accommodates
        this, both to the affair of election and reprobation, and to the
        business of the latter first,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022">Rom 9:22</a>, where he
        observes the end of God in it to show forth his power and wrath, and
        describes the subjects of it, which clears him from injustice, and
        points at the patience of God towards them, which frees him from the
        charge of cruelty,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#022">Rom 9:22</a>, and then
        proceeds to apply the metaphor before used, to the objects of election
        styled vessels of mercy, and the end of the Lord to manifest the riches
        of his glory in them, and the method he takes to bring them to eternal
        happiness, by preparing them for it by grace,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023">Rom 9:23</a>, which is done in
        the effectual calling, the objects of which are both Jews and Gentiles,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#024">Rom 9:24</a>, That it is the
        will of God that the Gentiles should be called, he proves,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025">Rom 9:25</a>, from some
        passages in Hosea,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023">Hos 2:23</a>, and that God had
        chosen, and so would call some among the Jews, he clearly makes appear,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#027">Rom 9:27</a>, from some
        prophecies of Isaiah,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022">Isa 10:22</a>, and then he
        concludes the chapter by observing the free and distinguishing grace of
        God, in the calling of the Gentiles, and the justification of them by
        the righteousness of Christ; that such who were far off from it, and
        sought not after it, should enjoy it,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#030">Rom 9:30</a>, when the
        Israelites, who were diligent and zealous in seeking after a
        righteousness to justify them before God, yet did not arrive to one,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#031">Rom 9:31</a>, the reasons of
        which are given, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032">Rom 9:32</a>,
        because it was not the righteousness of faith, or the righteousness of
        Christ received by faith they sought; but a legal one, and by works
        which can never be attained by sinful men: they sought after a wrong
        righteousness, and in a wrong way, because they stumbled at Christ, and
        rejected him and his righteousness; and this removes an objection which
        is suggested in the two preceding verses, that God is unrighteous in
        calling the Gentiles, who never sought after righteousness, and in
        rejecting the Jews that followed after one: and that they did stumble at
        Christ and his righteousness, is no other than what was foretold in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</a>, and that whoever
        believes in Christ, whether Jew or Gentile, shall be saved, he suggests
        is a doctrine agreeably to
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016">Isa 28:16</a>, which passages
        are referred to, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033">Rom 9:33</a>

      I say the truth in Christ, I lie not,.... The apostle being about to
      discourse concerning predestination, which he had mentioned in the
      preceding chapter, and to open the springs and causes of it, and also
      concerning the induration and rejection of the Jewish nation; he thought
      it necessary to preface his account of these things with some strong
      assurances of his great attachment to that people, and his affection for
      them, lest it should be thought he spoke out of prejudice to them; and
      well knowing in what situation he stood in with them, on account of his
      preaching up the abrogation of the ceremonial law, and how difficult it
      might be for him to obtain their belief in what he should say, he
      introduces it with a solemn oath, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not":
      which refers not to what he had said in the foregoing chapter, but to what
      he was going to say; and is all one as if he had said, as I am in Christ,
      a converted person, one born again, and renewed in the spirit of my mind,
      what I am about to speak is truth, and no lie; or I swear by Christ the
      God of truth, who is truth itself, and I appeal to him as the true God,
      the searcher of hearts, that what I now deliver is truth, and nothing but
      truth, and has no falsehood in it. This both shows that the taking of an
      oath is lawful, and that Christ is truly God, by whom only persons ought
      to swear:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        my conscience bearing me witness. The apostle, besides his appeal to
        Christ, calls his conscience to witness to the truth of his words; and
        this is as a thousand witnesses; there is in every man a conscience,
        which unless seared as with a red hot iron, will accuse or excuse, and
        bear a faithful testimony to words and actions; and especially a
        conscience enlightened, cleansed, and sanctified by the Spirit of God,
        as was the apostle's: hence he adds,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        in the Holy Ghost; meaning either that his conscience was influenced and
        directed by the Holy Ghost in what he was about to say; or it bore
        witness in and with the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost with that; so
        that here are three witnesses called in, Christ, conscience, and the
        Holy Ghost; and by three such witnesses, his words must be thought to be
        well established.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002">Romans 9:2</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="margnote"
          ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"
            ><a name="an_002">rom 9:2</a></font
          ></span
        >
      </p>
      That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. This is the
      thing he appeals to Christ for the truth of, and calls in his conscience
      and the Holy Ghost to bear witness to. These two words, "heaviness" and
      "sorrow", the one signifies grief, which had brought on heaviness on his
      spirits; and the other such pain as a woman in travail feels: and the
      trouble of his mind expressed by both, is described by its quantity,
      "great", it was not a little, but much; by its quality it was internal, it
      was in his "heart", it did not lie merely in outward show, in a few words
      or tears, but was in his heart, it was a heart sorrow; and by its
      duration, "continual", it was not a sudden emotion or passion, but what
      had been long in him, and had deeply affected and greatly depressed him:
      and what was the reason of all this? it is not expressed, but may pretty
      easily be understood; it was because of the obstinacy of his countrymen
      the Jews, the hardness of their hearts, and their wilful rejection of the
      Messiah; their trusting to their own righteousness, to the neglect and
      contempt of the righteousness of Christ, which he knew must unavoidably
      issue in their eternal destruction; also what greatly affected his mind
      was the utter rejection of them, as the people of God, and the judicial
      blindness, and hardness of heart, he full well knew was coming upon them,
      and which he was about to break unto them.
      <p align="center">
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Romans 9:3</a>

        >
      </p>
      For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ,.... Some consider
      this as the reason of the apostle's great heaviness, and continual sorrow
      of heart, because he had made such a wish as this, and read the words,
      "for I have wished", or "did wish"; that is, in my unregenerate state,
      whilst I was a persecutor of Christ, and a blasphemer of his name, I
      wished to be for ever separated from him, and to have nothing to do with
      him; for then I thought I ought to do many things contrary to the name of
      Jesus, and this I did out of respect to the Jewish nation, and because I
      would not relinquish the Jewish religion; but oh! what a trouble of mind
      is it to me? what uneasiness does it give me when I think of it, and
      reflect upon it? But this can never be the apostle's meaning, for he would
      never have appealed to Christ in so solemn a manner, and took an oath upon
      it, for the truth of his enmity to Christ, and alienation from him before
      conversion, which everybody knew; nor was it anything strange, that whilst
      he was an unbelieving Jew, he should wish himself separated from Jesus of
      Nazareth, and always to remain so; and his having done this before his
      embracing of Christianity could be no evidence of his present affection
      for the Jewish nation, especially since he repented of it, and was sorry
      for it. But this wish, whatever is meant by it, is mentioned as an
      instance of his great love to his countrymen the Jews. Many have thought
      that his meaning is, that he had so great a value for them, that he could
      even wish himself, and be content to be eternally separated from Christ,
      everlastingly banished from his presence, never to enjoy communion more
      with him, or in other words, to be eternally damned, that they might be
      saved. But this is what could never be, and which he knew, was impossible
      to be done, and was contrary to that strong persuasion he had just
      expressed in the close of the foregoing chapter. Nor is it consistent with
      his love to Christ, to wish any thing of this kind; it would make him to
      love the Jews much better than Christ; since, according to this sense, he
      must wish to be parted from him, that they might be saved, and
      consequently must love them more than Christ: nor is it consistent with,
      but even contrary both to the principles of nature and grace; it is
      contrary to the principles of nature, for a man to desire his own
      damnation upon any consideration whatever; and it is contrary to the
      principle of grace, which always strongly inclines to be with Christ, and
      not separated from him; in a word, to be accursed from Christ in this
      sense, could be no proper means of the salvation of the Jews, and
      therefore it cannot be thought to be desirable, or wished for. Some things
      are said indeed for the qualifying of this sense of the words, as that the
      apostle said this inconsiderately, when he was scarcely himself, through
      an ecstasy of mind, and intemperate zeal, and an overflow of affection for
      his nation; but this is highly to reflect upon the apostle, and to
      represent him in a very unworthy manner, when it is certain he said this
      with the greatest deliberation and seriousness; he introduces it in the
      most solemn manner, with an appeal to Christ, the Holy Spirit, and his own
      conscience, and therefore it could never drop from him through
      incogitancy, and an overheated affection. Again, it is said, that this
      wish was made with a condition, if it was the will of God, but that he
      knew was not; or if it could be for the good of these people, this also he
      knew it could never be: the best qualification Of it is to say it is an
      hyperbolical expression; and so if it is, it must be with a witness, being
      such an hyperbole, as is not to be matched in sacred or profane writings.
      The words of Moses are thought to be a parallel one, "blot me, I pray
      thee, out of the book which thou hast written",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032">Exo 32:32</a>; but that is not
      to be understood of the book of eternal life; but either of the book of
      the law, as R. Sol. Jarchi expounds it, which God had ordered him to
      write, and his desire is, that his name might not stand there; or rather
      of the book of this temporal life, that he might die and not live. It
      remains then that these words must have another meaning. Now let it be
      observed, that the word here translated "accursed", answers to the Hebrew
      word which, with the Jewish writers, is one sort of excommunication in use
      among them, and the greater sort; the forth of it, as given by them, is
      very horrible, and shocking (r); See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#022">Joh 9:22</a>; and so we may
      observe the word "anathema" here used is mentioned as a form of
      excommunication in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#022">Co1 16:22</a>; of all such as
      love not Christ and his Gospel, and make it appear by their principles or
      practices, or both, that they do not, and so ought to be removed from the
      communion of churches. Now, taking the word in this sense, the apostle's
      meaning is, that he could wish to be excommunicated from Christ; that is,
      from the body of Christ, from the church of Christ, Christ mystical, as
      the word "Christ" is used,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#012">Co1 12:12</a>; to be deprived of
      the ordinance of Christ's house, to be degraded from his office in it, and
      not to be so much as a member in it. He saw that these branches, the
      people of the Jews, were going to be cut off, and no longer to be of the
      church of God; and such was his affection to them, that he could have
      wished rather to be cut off himself, that they might be spared; and this
      was an instance of great love to them, since, next to Christ, the church
      and the ordinances of it were exceeding dear unto, and highly valued by
      the apostle. Again, it is worthy of observation, that the Hebrew word
      which the Septuagint render by the word in the text, is used for any thing
      devoted to God, and which could not be alienated to any other use or
      service; and if it was a man, or any among men that was devoted, it was
      not to be redeemed, but was "surely to be put to death",
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev027.htm#029">Lev 27:29</a>. Some have thought
      that Jephthah's daughter was put to death upon this law; but be that as it
      will, the apostle here may reasonably be thought to allude unto it, and
      his sense be this, that he could wish himself , "to be devoted unto
      death", not from Christ, but "by" Christ; and some copies read "by": I
      could wish that my dear Lord and Master, as if he should say, would
      appoint and order me to die, might this nation of mine but escape that
      ruin and destruction I see is coming upon them, as a nation and a church;
      I could be content to die the most accursed death, and be treated in the
      most ignominious manner, might they but be saved; a like expression is
      that of R. Ishmael (s), "may I be an expiatory sacrifice for the children
      of Israel";
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "which (says one commentator (t)) he said, , "because of his love to
        them"; and it is as if he should say, all the punishment which is right
        to come upon them, I will take it on myself, in order to atone for
        them;''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and says another (u),</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "the sense is, he took upon him their redemption, and this he said, ,
        "because of the greatness of his love":''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        now for a man to die for his country, that a whole nation perish not,
        was agreeably to the sentiments both of Jews and Gentiles, and was the
        highest instance of love among men; "greater love hath no man than this,
        that a man lay down his life for his friends",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#013">Joh 15:13</a>; and this is
        carrying the sense of the apostle's wish high enough, and not too far.
        The persons on whose account he could have expressed this wish, are
        described by their natural relation to him,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh: he calls them his
        brethren, not in a spiritual sense, nor in a strict natural sense, but
        in a general way, as being of the same nation: it is a saying with the
        Jews (w), , "all the Israelites are brethren"; for the same reason he
        calls them kinsmen; and these appellations he uses to remove that ill
        will and prejudice they had conceived in their minds against him, and to
        signify the ground of his affection for them: and he adds, "according to
        the flesh", to distinguish them from his spiritual brethren and
        relations; for though they were brethren in a national sense, they were
        not all so in a spiritual relation.

      Who are Israelites,.... Which were their national name, as descended from
      Jacob, whose name was Israel; and it was accounted a very honourable one;
      see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#005">Phi 3:5</a>; and the very name
      they bore gave the apostle some concern that they should be cut off; and
      then he proceeds to enumerate the several distinguishing favours and
      privileges they had been partakers of:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to whom pertaineth the adoption; not that special adoption, which
        springs from eternal predestination, is a blessing of the covenant of
        grace, comes through the redemption of Christ, and is received and
        enjoyed only by believers in him; for all that were Israelites, were not
        in this sense the children of God; but national adoption is here meant,
        by which the whole body of the people, as nation, were the sons of God,
        his firstborn:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the glory; either the ark of the covenant, which is so called in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002">Psa 63:2</a>, according to
        Kimchi; or the clouds in the tabernacle and temple, which were called
        the glory of the Lord, and were symbols of his presence, the same with
        the Shekinah; and so Aben Ezra interprets power, the ark, and glory, the
        Shekinah, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#002">Psa 63:2</a>,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the covenants; not the two Testaments, Old and New, but the covenant
        of circumcision, made with Abraham their father, and the covenant at
        Sinai they entered into with the Lord; some copies, and the Vulgate
        Latin and Ethiopic versions, read, "the covenant":
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the giving, of the law: , a way of speaking the (x) Jews make use of
        when they take notice of this privilege; for it was peculiarly given to
        them with great solemnity by God himself, through the disposition of
        angels into the hands of Moses the mediator, and by him to them; and on
        account of this, they reckoned themselves more beloved of God than the
        rest of mankind (y).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the service of God; or "the service", as in the Greek text. So the
        Jews (z) are used to call it "the service"; and false worship is called
        by them , "strange service", which is the title of one of their Misnic
        tracts; and here it signifies the whole worship of God, in the whole
        compass of it, sacrifices, prayer, praise, &amp;c. daily, weekly,
        monthly, and yearly:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the promises; both temporal and spiritual, especially such as
        related to the Messiah, and which now had their accomplishment.

      Whose are the fathers,.... Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for, according to
      the (a) Jewish writers,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "they call none in Israel "fathers", but three, and they are Abraham,
        Isaac, and Jacob; and they call none "mothers" but four, and they are,
        Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        their descent from these fathers was a privilege, though they valued
        themselves too highly upon it; but what was the crown and glory of all,
        and which they took the least, though the apostle took the most notice
        of, is,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came; that is, either of
        the fathers, or of the Israelites, from whom Christ, according to his
        human nature, sprung; being a son of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of
        the seed of David, and the son of Mary; hence the Messiah is called ,
        "the Messiah or Christ of Israel" (b):
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>who is described as</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        over all, angels and men, being the creator, upholder, and governor of
        them; and as having another nature, a divine one, being
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>God, truly and properly God,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        blessed for evermore; in himself, and to be blessed and praised by all
        creatures. The apostle alludes to that well known periphrastic name of
        God so much used by the Jews, , "the holy, blessed God"; to which, by
        way of assent and confirmation, the apostle puts his
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Amen. Now all these particular privileges are mentioned by him, as what
        heightened his concern for these people; it filled him with heaviness
        and sorrow of heart, when he considered, that persons who had been
        partakers of such favours, and especially the last, that the Messiah
        should spring from them, be born of them, and among them, and yet that
        they should be given up to ruin and destruction.
