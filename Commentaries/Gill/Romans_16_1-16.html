      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter contains a recommendation of a single person, herein
        mentioned; a list of the chief of the saints at Rome, who are saluted by
        name, and some with singular encomiums; a caution to beware of false
        teachers; various salutations of persons that were with the apostle sent
        to the church at Rome; and the whole is concluded with a doxology, or an
        ascription of glory to God. First, a commendation is given of a woman,
        by whom this long letter was sent, who is described by her name, Phebe;
        by her spiritual relation, a sister in Christ; by her office or
        character, a servant of the church at Cenchrea,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#001">Rom 16:1</a>, who is
        recommended to the saints at Rome, to receive her into their communion,
        conversation, and affection, as became them, and to assist her in every
        thing she might need from them; which is enforced by this reason,
        because she had been a succourer of the apostle, and many others,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#002">Rom 16:2</a>, and next follows
        a catalogue of the principal saints at Rome, to whom the apostle sends
        his Christian salutations; and among these stand, in the first place,
        Aquila and Priscilla, and the church in their house,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003">Rom 16:3</a>, who are
        described as greatly assisting to him in the cause of Christ, and as
        having a strong affection for him; which they showed by risking their
        lives on his account, for which he gives them thanks, as did all the
        churches: Secondly, Epaenetus is next saluted, as having a great
        interest in the apostle's affections, and as being one of the first
        converts in Achaia,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom 16:5</a>. Thirdly, a woman
        named Mary, who did her utmost to serve the apostle, and those that were
        with him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#006">Rom 16:6</a>.
        Fourthly, a couple of saints, Andronicus, and Junia, described by their
        relation to the apostle, his kinsmen; by their sufferings with him,
        fellow prisoners; by the fame and credit they were in among the
        Christians of the first rank, even the apostles; and by their early
        conversion, being converted before the apostle himself,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007">Rom 16:7</a>. Fifthly, next in
        the list is Amplias, who is saluted as in the Lord, and as beloved in
        him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#008">Rom 16:8</a>. Sixthly,
        two worthy men are joined together, Urban and Stachys; the one is
        saluted as an helper in Christ, and the other as beloved by the apostle,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#009">Rom 16:9</a>. Seventhly,
        Apelles is next named, and commended as one approved in Christ.
        Eighthly, the family of Aristobulus is greeted,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#010">Rom 16:10</a>. Ninthly, a
        kinsman of the apostle's, by name Herodion: and, Tenthly, the household
        of Narcissus, said to be in the Lord,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#011">Rom 16:11</a>. Eleventhly, two
        excellent women are greeted, who had been indefatigable in the service
        of Christ: and, Twelfthly, another woman, by name Persis, a person to be
        respected and loved, on account of her labour in the Lord,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#012">Rom 16:12</a>. Thirteenthly,
        Rufus is saluted as one chosen in Christ, and also his mother, and who
        was the mother of the apostle,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013">Rom 16:13</a>. Fourteenthly,
        five of the saints are joined together, who are mentioned by name, and
        other brethren with them, whose names are not set down,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#014">Rom 16:14</a>, and, Lastly,
        five other saints, with all the brethren with them, are likewise
        saluted, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#015">Rom 16:15</a>, and
        these, and all the members of the church, are exhorted to salute one
        another in an affectionate and chaste manner, who are told that all the
        churches saluted them,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016">Rom 16:16</a>, then follows
        the exhortation to take care of false teachers, to mark them, and avoid
        them; who are described as schismatics and heretics, making divisions in
        the church, and preaching contrary to the Gospel taught and learned,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#017">Rom 16:17</a>. The arguments
        or reasons made use of to enforce the exhortation, are taken partly from
        the characters of these teachers, being selfish men, who served not the
        Lord Jesus, but their own bellies; and deceivers, who by smooth words
        and plausible doctrines imposed upon simple minds,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#018">Rom 16:18</a>, and partly from
        the characters of the saints at Rome, who were simple and credulous, and
        ready to give in to everything that carried an appearance of truth; and
        though they were to be commended for their ready obedience to the
        Gospel, yet it became them to mingle wisdom and prudence with their
        simplicity and readiness to receive what appeared to be truth,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#019">Rom 16:19</a>, and from a
        promise of victory over Satan and his emissaries in a short time; to
        which the apostle annexes his usual salutation, and "Amen", as if he had
        concluded the epistle,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020">Rom 16:20</a>, but adds
        various salutations of persons that were with him, who desired to be
        remembered to the brethren at Rome, as Timotheus a fellow worker,
        Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, his kinsmen,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#021">Rom 16:21</a>, Tertius the
        writer of the epistle,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#022">Rom 16:22</a>, Gaius the host
        of the apostle, and of the whole church; Erastus, chamberlain of the
        city of Corinth, and Quartus a brother,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#023">Rom 16:23</a>, and then the
        apostle repeats the above salutation,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#024">Rom 16:24</a>, and yet still
        has not finished his epistle, but concludes with a doxology,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#025">Rom 16:25</a>, in which is
        celebrated the power of God, in establishing his people according to the
        Gospel, commended by its being the preaching of Christ, and the
        revelation of the mystery hid from ages past; and the goodness of God is
        also taken notice of, in giving orders to make it manifest, and in
        making it manifest to the Gentiles, in order to bring them to the
        obedience of faith; and likewise the wisdom of God is observed, to whom
        wisdom alone belongs, and which is apparent in the Gospel before
        mentioned, and in all the methods of his grace, as well as providence;
        and glory to him, through Christ for ever, is wished and prayed for; and
        so ends this excellent and valuable epistle.

      I commend unto you Phebe our sister,.... This chapter chiefly consists of
      commendations and salutations of persons, and begins with the former. It
      was usual to give letters of commendation of a member of one church to
      those of another; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001">Co2 3:1</a>; The person who is
      here recommended was, as appears from the subscription of this epistle, if
      that may be depended on, the bearer of this letter, and is described by
      her name, Phebe; as she dwelt at Cenchrea, it is probable she was a
      Grecian, as is her name. Pausanias (e) makes frequent mention of one of
      this name in Greece. With the Heathen poets, Pheobus was the sun, and
      Phoebe the moon. Though it is not unlikely that she might be a Jewess,
      since there were many of them in those parts; and this was a name in use
      among them. We often read (f) of R. Ishmael , "ben Phoebi", which I take
      to be the same name with this. She is recommended as a sister, "our
      sister"; not in a natural, but spiritual relation; one that was a member
      of the church at Cenchrea, and in full communion with it; for as it was
      usual to call the men brethren, it was common to call the women sisters.
      Elderly men were called fathers, younger men brethren; elderly women were
      styled mothers, and younger women sisters, who were partakers of the grace
      of God, and enjoyed the fellowship of the saints:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea. This place was a
        seaport of the Corinthians, distant from Corinth about seventy furlongs,
        or eight or nine miles: it was on one side of the Isthmus, as Lechea was
        on the other (g); See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018">Act 18:18</a>. In the way to
        this place from the Isthmus, as Pausanias relates (h), was the temple of
        Diana, and a very ancient sculpture; and in Cenchrea itself was the
        temple of Venus, and a wooden image; and near the flow of the sea was a
        Neptune of brass. But now, in this place, was a church of Jesus Christ;
        and since it was so near to Corinth, it shows that churches in those
        early times were not national, or provincial, but congregational. Of
        this church Phebe was a servant, or, as the word signifies, a minister
        or deacon; not that she was a teacher of the word, or preacher of the
        Gospel, for that was not allowed of by the apostle in the church at
        Corinth, that a woman should teach; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034">Co1 14:34</a>; and therefore
        would never be admitted at Cenchrea. Rather, as some think, she was a
        deaconess appointed by the church, to take care of the poor sisters of
        the church; though as they were usually poor, and ancient women; that
        were put into that service, and this woman, according to the account of
        her, being neither poor, nor very ancient; it seems rather, that being a
        rich and generous woman, she served or ministered to the church by
        relieving the poor; not out of the church's stock, as deaconesses did,
        but out of her own substance; and received the ministers of the Gospel,
        and all strangers, into her house, which was open to all Christians; and
        so was exceeding serviceable to that church, and to all the saints that
        came thither: though it is certain that among the ancient Christians
        there were women servants who were called ministers. Pliny, in an
        epistle of his to Trajan the emperor, says (i), that he had examined two
        maids, "quae ministrae dicebantur", "who were called ministers", to know
        the truth of the Christian religion.

      That ye receive her in the Lord,.... This is one thing he recommends her
      to them for, that they would receive her in a kind and friendly manner
      into their houses, and into their hearts' love and affections; admit her
      to their private meetings, and into church fellowship with them, and that
      as one that was in the Lord, and belonged to him; and also in his name,
      and for his sake:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        as becometh saints; that is, both that they would treat her with that
        humanity, courteousness, Christian affection, and respect, as became
        them who were saints by calling and profession; and that they would use
        her as being one of the saints, a godly, holy person, and as such an one
        ought to be used, by virtue of the communion of saints:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: what
        her business was at Rome is not known; whether it was only to visit the
        saints; or whether it was to have a cause tried in any court of
        judicature there; or whether she came upon worldly business, as Lydia of
        Thyatira was at Philippi to sell her purple, when the Apostle Paul was
        there, it matters not: whatever assistance they could give her, either
        by directing her where the saints lived; or by giving her proper counsel
        and advice; or helping her forward in her worldly affairs; or whatever
        she was concerned in, this is desired; and is another thing for which
        the apostle recommends her to them, adding this reason,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for she hath been a succourer of many; or "a patroness of many" of the
        saints in necessity and distress. The word that is here used, is, as
        Harpocratian says (k) the name by which such were called by the
        Athenians, , "that were over the sojourners", who had the care and
        direction of them. And such was this woman to the poor saints in
        Cenchrea, and the strangers that came thither; not as being in such an
        office by the order and appointment of the church, but what she
        cheerfully and voluntarily took up herself and performed at her own
        expense, otherwise there would not be so much in the character as to
        deserve such peculiar notice, nor she be so worthy of praise and
        commendation: moreover, the apostle observes, that he also partook of
        her succour and assistance,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and of myself also; which would hardly have been the case had she been
        one that had only the care of the poor sisters of the church, which was
        the office of the deaconess: but she being a rich generous woman, and
        the apostle having shared in her bounty, gratefully acknowledges it; and
        he the rather mentions it, as knowing it would the more endear her to
        the saints at Rome, who would take more notice of her for the respect
        she had shown to him.

      Greet Priscilla and Aquila,.... The former of these, who was a woman, and
      the wife of the latter, is in some copies called Prisca; and so the
      Vulgate Latin here reads it, as she is also called in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019">Ti2 4:19</a>. Her being named
      before her husband, is without design, for sometimes he is put before her,
      as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#002">Act 18:2</a>. And it is a
      rule with the Jews (l), that there is neither first nor last in the
      Scriptures; that is, strict order is not always observed; it is sometimes
      inverted, find nothing depends upon it: hence the reasons assigned by
      some, that she was first converted, or had more zeal than her husband, are
      uncertain and impertinent. She is called Priscilla in the Ethiopic
      version, as he is in the Arabic, Achilles: he was a Jew of Pontus, and was
      with his wife drove out of Rome by Claudius Caesar, when with her he went
      to Corinth, where he met with the Apostle Paul; and they being of the same
      craft, abode and wrought together at their trade of tent making; and when
      the apostle removed from thence, they went with him, and were with him at
      Ephesus; where, meeting with Apollos, who, though an eloquent man, and
      mighty in the Scriptures, yet being in some things deficient these two
      took him unto them, in a private way, and taught him the way of God's
      salvation more perfectly,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#024">Act 18:24</a>, where they left
      the apostle is not certain; but either Claudius being dead, or the edict
      which ordered the Jews to depart from Rome being revoked, or not regarded,
      they returned thither again; and were here when the apostle wrote this
      epistle, and whom he salutes, calling them
      <p></p>
      <p>
        my helpers in Christ Jesus; in spreading the Gospel, and promoting the
        kingdom, honour, and interest of Christ; for though they did not
        publicly preach, at least not Priscilla, yet they were very useful in
        their private conferences and instructions, both to ministers of the
        Gospel, as in the case of Apollos, and to young Christians: as the
        apostle, wherever he went, was instrument of the conversion of many
        souls; these were helpful privately in encouraging the young converts,
        comforting them with their own experiences and thereby helped them
        forward, instructed, strengthened, and established them; and so were
        greatly assistant to the apostle in the work of the Lord Jesus.

      Who for my life laid down their necks,.... That is, exposed themselves to
      great danger to save the apostle's life: the allusion is to the manner of
      executions by beheading, and to one person's laying down his head, and
      offering his neck to the executioner the room of another: this we are not
      to suppose was literally done; but the design of the expression is, that
      in some shape or another they risked their own lives for the apostle's;
      which might be done either at the insurrection in Corinth against Paul,
      when the Jews dragged him to the judgment seat of Gallio, and beat
      Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue before him; or the uproar in Ephesus
      by Demetrius and the craftsmen, when Paul and his companions were in great
      danger; at both which times and places these two persons were, and being
      very zealous, were no doubt active to preserve the apostle, and which he
      acknowledges with thankfulness:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        unto whom not only I give thanks, but all the churches of the Gentiles;
        both for the care they took of him, and the danger they exposed
        themselves to on his account; which the apostle expresses his sense of
        gratitude for, and which all the Gentile churches were under obligations
        to do likewise, since they had a common share in his labours and
        usefulness, he was the apostle of them all; and also for their help and
        assistance in carrying on the work of the Lord in all the churches of
        the Gentiles.

      </p>
      Likewise greet the church that is in their house,.... Which was either
      their own family, which might be somewhat large, and consisting entirely
      or chiefly of religious persons; for when they were in other places they
      had a church in their house as well as Rome; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019">Co1 16:19</a>; or the saints at
      Rome, who used to meet privately at their house, and pray and sing praises
      together, speak to one another of the things of God, and build up one
      another in their most faith; and from their gathering together in the name
      of Christ, and for the worship of him, and among whom his presence,
      according to his promise, was, they are called a church, or an assembly of
      Christians.

        Salute my well beloved Epaenetus; for though all the saints were beloved
        by the apostle, yet there were some, as this good man, for whom he might
        have, on some account or another, a particular affection; as our Lord,
        as man, had for his disciple John, though he loved all his disciples.
        There is one of this name, said to be one of the seventy disciples, and
        bishop of Carthage; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>.

        Who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ; that is, either he was one
        of the chief and principal for gifts and grace, or one of the first that
        was converted to Christ in those parts: the allusion is to the
        firstfruits under the law, which were offered unto the Lord, and were
        pledges of, and sanctified the rest. The Vulgate Latin, instead of
        Achaia, reads "Asia": and so it is read in the Alexandrian copy, and
        others: the reason of this different reading seems to be, because the
        house of Stephanas are said to be the firstfruits of Achaia,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#015">Co1 16:15</a>. But this
        hinders not but that Epaenetus might be so too, for he might be one of
        the family of Stephanas, who was now removed to Rome. If he was a Jew,
        his Jewish name might be Judah, the same with Epaenetus, in Greek.

      Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. Some copies read, "you"; and
      so do the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions: and indeed
      it seems most likely that the persons on whom this good woman bestowed so
      much labour, and to whom she was so very serviceable, were the saints at
      Rome, where she lived, rather than the apostle and his companions; not but
      that she might have been in some parts where she had met with him, and his
      friends, and had been very indefatigable in assisting and supplying them,
      in a very generous and liberal manner, with all the necessaries of life;
      and was exceeding useful in encouraging the ministers of the Gospel, and
      in promoting the interest of Christ. Her name Mary is the same with Miriam
      in Hebrew; whether she was of Jewish extract is not certain, and who she
      was is not known: some have conjectured her to be the same that Ignatius
      wrote an epistle to; not Mary of Castabilis, but of Naples, who was at
      Rome in the time of Linus, the Latin version reads "Cletus", and of
      Clement, on whom he bestows very great characters; calling her most
      faithful, worthy of God, and a bearer of Christ, and in all things wise
      (m): and in another letter (n) of his he represents her as exceeding
      learned, an exemplar of godly women, and having a church in her house. But
      both these epistles are thought, by learned men, to be falsely ascribed to
      him, and so not to be depended on.

      Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen,.... According to the flesh, being
      perhaps not only of the same nation, Jews, but also of the same tribe, the
      tribe of Benjamin, and even of the same family, and might be nearly allied
      in blood. And though the apostle did not value himself upon his carnal
      descent, yet he had a very great value and affection for his relations
      after the flesh, even though they were only of the same nation; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#003">Rom 9:3</a>; and especially for
      such as were partakers of the grace of God, as these his kinsmen were.
      These were their Gentile names, the one Greek, the other Latin; but both
      were Jews. Grotius thinks that their Jewish names were, the one Masinissa,
      and the other Naarah; and that the latter was the wife of the former, but
      they rather seem both to be men; Junia should be read Junias, a
      contraction of Junilius:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and my fellow prisoners; either at Philippi, or in some other place; for
        though we read only of the apostle's being in prison at that place, and
        at Rome, yet it is certain from his own account,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023">Co2 11:23</a>; that he was
        frequently imprisoned; and Clement of Rome says, he was seven times in
        bonds (o), at one of which times these were bound with him, but when and
        where is not known. This is a greater character of them, and a greater
        honour to them, than to be called his kinsmen after the flesh:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who are of note among the apostles; were well known by, and in great
        account with the twelve apostles, though not of their number; they might
        be converted by them, and be followers of them in Judea; they are
        thought by some to be of the number of the seventy disciples, whom
        Christ himself sent forth to preach: Andronicus particularly is
        mentioned among them, and said to be bishop of Pannonia, or rather of
        Spain; See Gill on ; however, they might be preachers of the Gospel, and
        be persons of great fame and renown as such; for which reason they might
        be called apostles, that being a name sometimes given to ordinary
        ministers of the word, and to such who were messengers of the churches,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#023">Co2 8:23</a>, as these might
        be, and were famous for their prudent, faithful, and diligent discharge
        of their office and duty:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who also were in Christ before me; which is to be understood, not of
        their secret being in Christ, as being loved by him, chosen in him,
        given to him, and represented by him in the covenant of grace; for they
        had not a place in Christ's heart, or a share in his love before him;
        wherefore the Arabic version is not only a bad one, but carries a false
        sense in it; which renders the clause thus, "who were in the love of
        Christ before me": nor were they chosen in Christ before him, for all
        the elect were chosen together in him before the foundation of the
        world; nor were they given to him, put into his hands, and made his care
        and charge before him; nor were they considered in Christ as their
        covenant head before him; Christ became their surety for them together,
        and received grace, blessings, and promises for them, and they in him
        before the world began; and was their common head and representative in
        time, in their nature; and they were all together crucified, buried, and
        raised with him, and set down with him in heavenly places together. But
        they were in the profession of faith, and in the church of Christ, and
        in the ministry of the word before him, being converted and brought to
        the faith of Christ before he was; which is the saints' open being in
        Christ, and is the effect and evidence of their being secretly in him
        from everlasting: this is to be created in Christ, or made new creatures
        in him; to be brought to believe in him, and even into him for
        righteousness, pardon, peace, acceptance, and eternal life, which are in
        him; and to live upon him, and in him, and derive all light and life,
        grace and strength, joy, peace, and comfort from him, as the branch
        derives its sap and nourishment from the vine, in which it is; and in
        this sense these men were in Christ before the apostle; they were
        converted persons, professors of religion, members of a church, and
        Gospel ministers before him: and though this is nothing in the business
        of salvation, who is called first or last; the one is equally as safe
        and as happy as the other; the thief that was called at the last hour,
        and the last man that will be called by grace in the world; yet it is a
        great blessing and mercy to be converted early; hereby a multitude of
        sins is prevented, and more, service done for Christ. And doubtless the
        apostle had this in view, and therefore gives these his kinsmen the
        preference to himself, that whilst he was a blasphemer of Christ, a
        persecutor of his people, and injurious to his interest, these made a
        profession of his name, preached his Gospel, and served his cause: it
        shows also, that they were persevering Christians, were pillars in the
        house of God, and never went out; and on account of their constancy and
        long standing, were worthy of respect. The apostle rises gradually in
        the character of these persons; as it was more to be fellow prisoners
        with him than to be his kinsmen, so it was more to be of note among the
        apostles, or to be eminent preachers of the Gospel, than to be fellow
        prisoners with him; and it was more to be in Christ than them all, than
        to be Paul's kinsmen, fellow prisoners with him, or to be known and
        approved of by the apostles, to be messengers of churches, preachers of
        the word, or even to be apostles themselves, and the chiefest of them;
        for such are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ, are
        complete and perfect in him, are safe and secure, and can never perish;
        and being once in Christ, are always in him, and will be found in him
        living and dying, and at judgment.

      Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. This was a Roman name; the Vulgate
      Latin reads "Ampliatus", and so do the Alexandrian copy, and the Ethiopic
      version: some call him "Amphias", and "Amphiatus", and say, but whether on
      good authority I will not affirm, that this man was bishop of Odyssus; but
      be he who he will, the apostle had a singular affection for him; and that
      not upon any external account, as natural relation, riches, honour,
      learning, &amp;c. but for the Lord's sake, and as he was in Christ, a
      member of him, and so in a spiritual relation to the apostle; a "brother"
      of his, as the Ethiopic version here calls him; and because he was
      honoured with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and for his usefulness
      in the Gospel of Christ Jesus.

      Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ,.... This also was a Roman name, and
      which many of the popes of Rome have since taken to themselves; he is said
      to be one of the seventy disciples, and to be a bishop in Macedonia; See
      Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>; which is not very
      probable: others have conjectured him to be one of the pastors of the
      church of Rome, which is more likely; and if he was, but few of his
      successors have deserved the character given of him, an "helper in
      Christ"; in spreading the Gospel, and enlarging the kingdom and interest
      of Christ:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and Stachys my beloved; this is a Greek name, he is said to be one of
        the seventy disciples, and bishop of Byzantium; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>. According to the
        Roman martyrology, he was ordained bishop of the Byzantine church, by
        Andrew the apostle, but this is not to be depended on; he was, however,
        because of his faith in Christ, and love to him, or on such like
        spiritual accounts, very dear to the apostle.

      Salute Apelles approved in Christ,.... Origen was in doubt whether this
      was not the same person with Apollos the Alexandrian Jew, whom Aquila and
      Priscilla met with at Ephesus; but had he been intended, the apostle would
      doubtless have said more of him, he being so eminent and remarkable a
      preacher of the Gospel; though indeed the character here given is very
      considerable; besides, Apollos did not live at Rome, though it was not
      impossible he might be there at this time. The name seems to be a Greek
      one, there was a famous painter of this name in Greece; though it was also
      used among the Jews, and this person here might possibly, be a Jew; for
      Horace (p) speaks of one of this name, when he says, "credat Judaeus
      Apella"; by whom he means, not, as many have thought, a circumcised Jew in
      general, but a particular person, a Jew of that name: but it is of no
      importance whether he was a Jew or a Gentile; some say he was one of the
      seventy disciples, and bishop of Smyrna; See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>. However, he was
      one that was approved in Christ; approved of God in Christ, who approves
      of none but in Christ; not of any on account of their own commendations,
      or those of others; for not he that commendeth himself is approved of God,
      nor whom others commend; and oftentimes what is highly esteemed of men, is
      abominable in the sight of God; nor does he approve of any on the score of
      their own works and duties, or as in themselves considered, whose
      righteousness in as filthy rags, and they themselves polluted and unclean;
      but as in Christ his well beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased, and
      with all in him; and so God's elect are, as this man was approved of in
      him the beloved, even in his own Son, in whom both persons and services
      are accepted: moreover he was approved of by Christ, and that from
      eternity, as presented to him in the glass of his Father's purposes and
      decrees; and in time, as adorned with his own grace, and clothed with his
      justifying righteousness, and as faithfully serving him in his day and
      generation: he was also proved to be in Christ; he had proved it to
      himself, to his own satisfaction, by observing, upon self-examination,
      that Christ was in him; and he had made it to appear to others, by his
      faith in Christ, love to him, zeal for him, and close attachment to his
      Gospel, against all errors and heresies, whereby they are approved are
      made manifest; and that in the face of all opposition and persecution: he
      was tried and proved, and so approved by a variety of tribulations and
      afflictions; his faith remained firm, and he abode by the interest of a
      Redeemer; and so he was tried, or proved, as the Arabic version renders
      it, "in the religion of Christ"; in which he was sincere, upright, and
      faithful; his faith was unfeigned, his love without dissimulation, he was
      an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile: if a preacher of the
      word, he did not corrupt it, but in sincerity, and as in the sight of God
      and Christ, spoke it; and if only a private believer, he was one that
      desired the sincere milk of the word, and was in all respects a sincere
      upright man in Christ; so the word here used may be understood, being the
      reverse of reprobate, rejected, spurious, adulterate and disapproved: in a
      word, this character shows, that he was not only approved of God and
      Christ, but of all good men, and particularly the apostle; and that on
      account of his being in Christ, united to him, and closely attached to his
      service and interest, and was an honour to it:
      <p></p>

        salute them which are of Aristobulus's household. This was also a Greek
        name, though in use among the Jews; there was one of this name master of

      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        One of the sons of Hyrcanus, the high priest of the Jews, was called by
        this name; Herod had a son of this name, and it was a name much in use
        in his family, and among his descendants: who this man was is not known,
        nor is he himself saluted by the apostle; either because he was now
        dead, or was absent from Rome at this time; for some say he was sent
        into Britain, our isle, to preach the Gospel, of which he is said to be
        bishop, and one of the seventy disciples; See Gill on ; or perhaps he
        might not be a believer in Christ, only his household believers, and
        therefore they only are taken notice of.

      nation, a Jew; or of the same tribe, the tribe of Benjamin; or of the same
      family, and nearly allied in blood to him: though the name is of Attic, or
      Parthic original, and seems to be a derivative of Herod; this man is

        Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord;
        some have thought, that this Narcissus is the same man that Suetonius
        (q) and other writers speak of (r), who was secretary to Claudius
        Caesar; a very great favourite of his, who amassed a great deal of
        wealth under him, and was raised to great honour and dignity by him: he
        himself is not saluted, either because he was not at home, which might
        be the case, if, as Ambrose, or rather Hilary the deacon on the text
        says, he was a presbyter and abroad, performing his office in foreign
        parts; or because he was dead, or rather not a believer: if he was the
        same with Claudius's favourite, he was dead before this time, being
        miserably put to death by Agrippina (s), the wife of Claudius; and seems
        to have died a wicked man, and justly punished for his being the cause
        of the destruction of others, through his calumnies: nor are all of his
        household saluted, not being all converted persons; it being frequently
        the method of divine grace to take some of a family, and not all, and
        bring them to Zion; only those that were "in the Lord", on his heart,
        and in his hands, secretly represented by him, and united to him, and
        who were openly in him, being called by his grace, and brought to
        believe in him, and live upon him.

      Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord,.... These two were
      women, and are said to be noble women of Iconium, whom the apostle
      converted there, and afterwards went to Rome the names are Greek (t),
      though they might be Jewish women, since Tryphon is the name of a man
      among the Jews. Trypho, the famous Jew, with whom Justin Martyr had his
      dialogue, is well known, and perhaps is the same with R. Tarphon, or
      Tryphon, so often mentioned in the Misnic and Talmudic writings: however,
      as these were women, their labour cannot be understood of their labouring
      in the word of the Lord, or in the public ministry of it, since this was
      forbid by the apostle, and therefore would never commend them on account
      of it; but of their great usefulness and indefatigableness, in serving the
      interest of their dear Lord with their purses; in relieving the poor of
      the church, in entertaining and supplying the ministers of the Gospel, as
      well as by their private instructions, exhortations, and giving an account
      of their own experience, whereby they might greatly encourage, edify, and
      strengthen young converts, and other Christians, as Priscilla with her
      husband did; and were unwearied in doing everything that they were capable
      of, in promoting the Gospel and kingdom of Christ:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord; who being a
        woman also, and perhaps of Persic original, and might have her name from
        her country; her labour must be understood of the same kind with the
        former, only with this addition, that she abounded and exceeded in it;
        she is said by the Syriac scholiast to be the wife of Rufus, mentioned
        in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#013">Rom 16:13</a>.

      Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord,.... This was a Roman name; frequent
      mention is made Jewish writings (u) of one Turnus Rufus, a Roman officer,
      that destroyed the temple, and ploughed up the city of Jerusalem; the name
      was in use among the Cyrenians, for one of the sons of Simon of Cyrene,
      whom the Jews compelled to carry the cross of Christ, was so called,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#021">Mar 15:21</a>; and some have
      thought that the same person is here meant, nor is it unlikely; he is said
      to be one of the seventy disciples, and to be bishop of Thebes; See Gill
      on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>. The apostle
      knew him, and that as one "chosen in the Lord"; meaning either that he was
      a choice believer in Christ, an excellent Christian, one of the highest
      form; for though all true believers have like precious faith, yet some are
      strong, and others weak, in the exercise of it; this man was eminent for
      his faith in Christ: or he might be one that was chosen to some office in
      the church, as to that of a deacon, or pastor; though had this been the
      case, it is much the particular office was not mentioned: rather therefore
      this is to be understood of his being chosen in Christ to grace and glory
      and that from all eternity; for the phrase is only used in one place more,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004">Eph 1:4</a>; and there most
      manifestly designs the election of persons in Christ, before the
      foundation of the world; which election is made not "for" Christ, or the
      sake of his merits, his blood, righteousness and sacrifice, which have no
      causal influence on this act, and which purely arises from the love and
      grace of God; nor merely "by" him as God equal with the Father, though
      this is true; but "in" him, as the head and representative of the chosen
      ones: this instance, as others, shows that election is not of nations, nor
      churches, but of particular persons; and so expresses the distinguishing,
      free, and sovereign grace of God in it, that one and not another should be
      chosen; though these are on an equal foot, and so not owing to foreseen
      faith, holiness, and good works. The apostle knew this man to be a chosen
      vessel, not by immediate revelation, or divine inspiration, but by his
      faith in Christ, and love to him, and by the power of the Gospel on him;
      and so may anyone know himself, or another man hereby to be chosen, and
      ought in a judgment of charity so to think of him, as long as his life is
      agreeably to his profession; see
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#004">Th1 1:4</a>. The apostle not
      only salutes this man, but his mother also, who doubtless was a believer
      in Christ, and highly respected by him:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and his mother and mine; the mother of Rufus in nature, and his mother
        in affection; and who very probably had endeared herself to the apostle
        by some kind offices, which she, as a Christian, had performed towards
        him; for the apostle cannot mean his own natural mother, besides
        Rufus's, whom he salutes, and whom Anselm on the place suggests might be
        at Rome; since it can hardly be thought he would have passed the mention
        of her in so transient a manner.

      Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes,.... The two first of
      these names are Greek, and the persons called by them, with Herodion
      before mentioned, are taken notice of in the Roman martyrology, as
      disciples of the apostle; Asyncritus is said to be bishop of Hyrcania, and
      Phlegon of Marathon, and both of the seventy disciples; See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>; Hermas is said to
      be bishop of Philippi, or Aquileia, and brother of Pope Pius the First,
      and to be the author of the book called Pastor, or the Shepherd, cited by
      many of the ancients; but all is doubtful and uncertain. Patrobas is a
      Roman name, Martial makes mention of it (w); it seems to be composed of
      the Greek word or the Latin "pater", and the Syriac "Abba", and signifies
      the same as the other two. This man might be a Jew, whose name was Abba;
      we often read of R. Abba in the Jewish writings (x), and as the Jews were
      wont to have two names, the one Gentile, the other Jewish, Pater might be
      this man's Gentile name, and Abba his Jewish one, and both being put
      together, by contraction be called "Patrobas"; he is said to be of the
      seventy disciples, and to be bishop of Puteoli; See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>. The last of them,
      Hermes, is a Greek name, the same with Mercurius, which the Lystrians
      called Paul by, in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#012">Act 14:12</a>, who he was is not
      known; he is also mentioned among the seventy disciples, and said to be
      bishop of Dalmatia:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and the brethren which are with them; these seem to have lived together,
        with others who were their brethren, not in a natural but spiritual
        relation, and whom the apostle owned and loved as such.

      Salute Philologus, and Julia,.... The first of these is a Greek name, and
      the name of a man, and signifies a lover of learning. This name Atteius
      assumed to himself, which Eratosthenes had done before him, because of his
      great learning (y); this man is reckoned among the seventy disciples, and
      is said to be bishop of Sinope: See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>. Julia is a woman's
      name, and Roman, probably the wife of the former; one of Stephens's copies
      read, "Junia":
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with
        them; who all dwelt together also in one family; and were saints, by
        separation, imputation, and the effectual calling; were called to be
        saints, and lived as such, and had a place in the apostle's affections
        on that account: Nerio, or Neriene, according to Gellius (z), was a name
        with the Sabines, signifying "strength", from whence came Nero; and
        Olympas is the same with Olympius, said to be of the seventy disciples,
        and a Roman martyr; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>. It deserves some
        notice, that among all the persons here mentioned by name, known by the
        apostle to be at Rome, that he takes no notice of Peter; which surely he
        would have done, had he been, as the Papists say, bishop of Rome, and
        resided there.

      Salute one another with an holy kiss,.... Christian salutation is a
      wishing all temporal, spiritual, and eternal happiness, to one another;
      and which, as it should be mutual, should be also hearty and sincere, and
      this is meant by the "holy kiss"; the allusion is to a common custom in
      most nations, used by friends at meeting or parting, to kiss each other,
      in token of their hearty love, and sincere affection and friendship for
      each other; and is called "holy", to distinguish it from an unchaste and
      lascivious one; and from an hypocritical and deceitful one, such an one as
      Joab gave to Amasa, when, inquiring of his health, he took him by the
      beard to kiss him, and stabbed him under the fifth rib,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#009">Sa2 20:9</a>; and as Judas, who
      cried, hail master, to Christ, and kissed him, and betrayed him into the
      hands of his enemies,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#049">Mat 26:49</a>. I say, it is an
      allusion to this custom, for it is only an allusion; the apostle did not
      mean that any outward action should be made use of, only that their
      Christian salutations should not be mere complaisance, or expressed by
      bare words, and outward gestures and actions, either of the hand or mouth;
      but that they should spring from real love and true friendship, and be
      without dissimulation, hearty and sincere:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the churches of Christ salute you. The Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic,
        and Ethiopic versions read, "all the churches"; that is, in Greece, or
        in the neighbourhood where the apostle was, and who might know of his
        writing to this church, and thereby send their Christian salutations to
        it; or if they did not know of his writing, yet as he knew their sincere
        affections, and hearty good will to this church, and the members of it,
        he in their names sent greetings to them: this shows the communion of
        churches, and how they ought to wish and sincerely desire each other's
        welfare.
