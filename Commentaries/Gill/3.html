Now we know that what things soever the law saith,.... By "the law" is meant,
not the law of nature, nor the civil law of nations, nor the ceremonial law of
the Jews, nor barely the five books of Moses, nor the book of Psalms, of the
Prophets, or the writings of the whole Old Testament; but the moral law, as it
appears in the whole word of God, which every man is bound to observe, of which
all are transgressors, by which is the knowledge of sin, which no man can be
justified by, and which Christ was made under, and came to fulfil. This law is
represented as a person speaking, and saying many things, some of which are here
mentioned; so, , "the law says" so and so, is an usual phrase with Jewish
writers (y). The persons it speaks to, are
<p></p>
<p>
  them that are under the law; the Jews were in a peculiar sense under it, as it
  was given to them by Moses; all mankind are under it, as to the matter of it;
  they are under obligation to obedience to it, and, through disobedience, come
  under its sentence of condemnation. The elect of God themselves were, and are
  in some sense under it; not indeed as a covenant of works, or as in the hands
  of Moses, nor as a yoke of bondage; nor are they obliged to seek for
  justification by it, and are entirely delivered from the curse and
  condemnation of it by Christ. They were under it, and that as a covenant of
  works, as in Adam, the federal head and representative of all mankind; and
  came under its sentence of condemnation and death, for his sin, and their own
  actual transgressions; which is consistent with the everlasting love of God to
  them in Christ, the covenant of grace made with them in him, as their head and
  surety, and their justification by him: and they are now under it, as in the
  hands of Christ; and look upon themselves as obliged, by the love of Christ,
  to yield a cheerful obedience to it: here it means such as are transgressors
  of the law, and so under obligation to punishment, without any regard to Jew
  or Gentile, or any distinction God has made in his own breast: and the things
  it says to such are, it charges them with sin, and convicts them of it, both
  of its pollution and guilt: so
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  that every mouth may be stopped; and have nothing to say of the purity of
  their nature, which appears to be so sadly stained; nor of their works of
  righteousness, which are so few, and so very imperfect. The law makes such a
  representation of things to them, that their mouths are stopped from glorying
  in themselves, and in their works, which are far from being adequate to the
  demands of the law; and from complaining against the righteous judgment of
  God, should he proceed against them in the most rigorous manner:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  and all the world may become guilty before God; Jews and Gentiles; all the
  individuals of mankind are guilty before God, and will be found to be so,
  sooner or later: some read it, "subject to God", and understand it of a
  subjection to his grace, being brought to see their need of it, and of
  salvation by it; but this is not the case of all the world, rather signifies a
  subjection to that justice, vengeance, and wrath of God, to which all men are
  liable in their own persons; since they are all found guilty by the law, and
  will appear to be so, and therefore can never be justified by their obedience
  to it; which is what the apostle is aiming at in all he here says, as appears
  from what follows; all which "we know" to be true, and are fully assured of,
  who know the nature and spirituality of the law, and to whom it has come with
  light and power.
</p>

</p>
Therefore by the deeds of the law,.... Hence it most clearly appears, that there
can be no justification before God by the law, since it stops the mouths of men,
and pronounces them guilty: by "the deeds of the law" are meant, works done in
obedience to it, as performed by sinful men, which are very imperfect; not as
performed by Adam in innocence or by Christ in our nature whose works were
perfect; but as performed by sinful men and of themselves, and not as performed
in and by Christ for them who is the fulfilling end of the law for righteousness
to all believers: now by such works as these whether wrought before or after
conversion, with or without the strength and grace of Christ,
<p></p>
<p>
  there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: that is, no one person:
  "flesh" designs men, and men as corrupt and carnal, in opposition to God, who
  is a Spirit pure and holy; and may have respect to the vain opinion of Jews
  and Gentiles, who were vainly puffed up in their fleshly mind; the one on
  account of their wisdom and learning, the other on account of their
  righteousness; and includes all the individuals of human nature:, the word
  "justified", does not signify being made righteous by the infusion of
  righteousness, for the infusion of a righteousness, or holiness, is
  sanctification, which is a work of the Spirit of God, is internal, and
  imperfect, and so not justifying; but it is a forensic word, or legal term,
  and stands opposed to a being condemned; and signifies to be acquitted,
  discharged, and made righteous in a legal sense, which can never be done by an
  imperfect obedience to the law: men may be justified hereby in their own
  sight, and in the sight of others, but not in "his sight"; in the sight of
  God, who is omniscient, and sees not as man seeth; who is pure, holy, and
  righteous, and whose judgment is according to truth: this is said in direct
  contradiction to the Jews (z), who say,
</p>
<p></p>
<p>"a man is not justified for ever, but by the words of the law:''</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  but in his sight none can be justified, but by the perfect obedience and
  righteousness of Christ. The reason for it is,
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  for by the law is the knowledge of sin; it discovers to a man, by the light of
  the Spirit of God, and as under his influence, and attended with his power,
  the sins both of his heart and life; and so he is convinced by it as a
  transgressor and finds himself guilty, and liable to condemnation and death;
  wherefore he can never hope for and expect justification by it. The Jews
  ascribe such an use as this to the law, which they suppose it performs in a
  very gentle manner;
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  "he that rises in the night (say they (a)), and studies in the law, , "the law
  makes known to him his sin", but not in a way of judgment, but as a mother
  makes known to her son in tender language:''
</p>
<p></p>
<p>but this is generally done in a rougher way, for the law works wrath.</p>

</p>
But now the righteousness of God,.... The apostle having proved that all men are
unrighteous, and that no man can be justified in the sight of God by his
obedience, either to the law of nature or of Moses, proceeds to give an account
of that righteousness, which does justify before God; and so returns to his
former subject, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Rom 1:17</a>,
concerning "the righteousness of God", the revelation of which he makes to be
peculiar to the Gospel, as he does here; since he says, that it
<p></p>
<p>
  without the law is manifested: meaning, either that this righteousness is
  without the law, and the deeds of it, as performed by sinful men; or that the
  manifestation of it is without the law, either of nature or of Moses; for the
  law discovers sin, but not a righteousness which justifies from sin; it shows
  what righteousness is, but does not direct the sinner where there is one to be
  had, that will make him righteous in the sight of God: this is made known
  without the law, and only in the Gospel:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  being witnessed by the law and the prophets; a testimony is borne to the
  justifying righteousness of Christ both "by the law", particularly in the five
  books of Moses; which testify of Christ, of his obedience, sufferings, and
  death, by which he brought in life and righteousness; see
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</a>, compared with
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024">Dan 9:24</a>; and
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006">Gen 15:6</a> with
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009">Rom 4:9</a>; and
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018">Gen 22:18</a> with

  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#011">Deu 30:11</a> with
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005">Rom 10:5</a>. And the prophets;
  Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, and others; see
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#021">Isa 42:21</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">rom 3:22</a></font></span
  >
</p>
Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ,.... A further
account is given of this righteousness: why it is called "the righteousness of
God", and in what sense revealed and manifested; see Gill on
<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#017">Rom 1:17</a>; Here it is said to be
"by faith of Jesus Christ"; not by that faith which Christ himself had as man,
but by that faith, of which he the author and object: the Alexandrian copy
reads, "by faith in Jesus Christ"; and not by that as the cause of
justification; for faith is neither the efficient, nor the moving, nor
meritorious cause of it; no, nor the instrumental cause of it on the part of God
or Christ: nor is faith the matter of a justifying righteousness; for faith is a
part of sanctification, is itself imperfect, is a man's own, as it is implanted
in him, and exercised by him; is here and elsewhere distinguished from
righteousness; something else, and not that, as the obedience and blood of
Christ, are said to be what men are made righteous and justified by: but faith
is a means of apprehending and receiving righteousness; it views the excellency
of Christ's righteousness; it owns the sufficiency of it; the soul by it
renounces its own righteousness, submits to Christ's, rejoices in it, and gives
him the glory of it: now this is by, or through faith,
<p></p>
<p>
  unto all, and upon all: not all men, for all have not faith, nor are all
  justified and saved: but
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  all that believe; which must be understood, not of believing any thing, nor of
  any sort of believing; but of such, who truly and with the heart believe in
  Christ for salvation; and who are here opposed to the wise philosophers among
  the Gentiles, had to all self-righteous persons among the Jews. Though this
  character does not design any cause or condition of justification, but is only
  descriptive of the persons, who are declaratively interested in a justifying
  righteousness, which is said to be "unto", and "upon them"; that is, it is
  appointed, provided, and wrought out for them, and directed and applied unto
  them, and put upon them as a garment, and that upon all of them:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  for there is no difference; of nation, age, or sex, or of state and condition;
  no respect is had to persons or works; nor is there any difference with
  respect to weak or strong believers; the righteousness is equally applied to
  one as to another, and one is as much justified by it in the sight of God as
  another.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">rom 3:23</a></font></span
  >
</p>
For all have sinned,.... This is the general character of all mankind; all have
sinned in Adam, are guilty by his sin, polluted with it, and condemned for it;
all are sinners in themselves, and by their own actual transgressions; this is
the case of the whole world, and of all the men in it; not only of the Gentiles,
but of the Jews, and the more righteous among them: hence there is no difference
in the state and condition of men by nature; nor is there any reason from and in
themselves, why God saves one and not another; nor any room to despair of the
grace and righteousness of Christ, on account of persons being, in their own
view, the worst of sinners:
<p></p>
<p>and hence it is, that they are all</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  come short of the glory of God; either of glorifying of God; man was made for
  this purpose, and was capable of it, though now through sin incapable; and it
  is only by the grace of God that he is enabled to do it: or of glorying:
  before him; sin has made him infamous, and is his shame; by it he has
  forfeited all external favours, and has nothing of his own to glory in; his
  moral righteousness is no foundation for boasting, especially before God: or
  of having glory from God; the most pure and perfect creature does not of
  itself deserve any glory and praise from God; good men, in a way of grace,
  will have praise of God; but sinners can never expect any on their own
  account: or of the glorious grace of God, as sanctifying and pardoning grace,
  and particularly the grace of a justifying righteousness; man has no
  righteousness, nor can he work out one; nor will his own avail, he wants a
  better than that: or of eternal glory; which may be called the glory of God,
  because it is of his preparing, what he calls persons to by his grace, and
  which of his own free grace he bestows upon them, and will chiefly lie in the
  enjoyment of him; now this is represented sometimes as a prize, which is run
  for, and pressed after; but men, through sinning, come short of it, and must
  of themselves do so for ever: or rather of the image of God in man, who is
  called "the image and glory of God",
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#007">Co1 11:7</a>, which consisted
  externally in government over the creatures; internally, in righteousness and
  holiness, in wisdom and knowledge, in the bias of his mind to that which is
  good, and in power to perform it; of all which he is come short, or deprived
  by sinning.

</p>
Being justified freely by his grace,.... The matter of justification is before
expressed, and the persons that share in this blessing are described; here the
several causes of it are mentioned. The moving cause of it is the free grace of
God; for by "the grace of God" here, is not meant the Gospel, or what some men
call the terms of the Gospel, and the constitution of it; nor the grace of God
infused into the heart; but the free love and favour of God, as it is in his
heart; which is wonderfully displayed in the business of a sinner's
justification before him: it appears in his resolving upon the justification of
his chosen ones in Christ; in fixing on the method of doing it; in setting forth
and pre-ordaining Christ to be the ransom; in calling Christ to engage herein;
in Christ's engaging as a surety for his people, and in the Father's sending him
to bring in everlasting righteousness; in Christ's coming to do it, and in the
gracious manner in which he wrought it out; in the Father's gracious
acceptation, imputation, and donation of it; in the free gift of the grace of
faith, to apprehend and receive it; and in the persons that partake of it, who
are of themselves sinners and ungodly. The meritorious cause of justification
is,
<p></p>
<p>
  the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: redemption supposes a former state of
  captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were by nature, and
  is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature, chiefly respects the
  soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal: this is in and by Christ; he
  was called unto it, was sent to effect it, had a right unto it, as being the
  near kinsman; and was every way fit for it, being both God and man; and has by
  his sufferings and death obtained it: now, as all the blessings of grace come
  through redemption by Christ, so does this of justification, and after this
  manner; Christ, as a Redeemer, had the sins of his people laid on him, and
  they were bore by him, and took away; the sentence of the law's condemnation
  was executed on him, as standing in their legal place and stead; and
  satisfaction was made by him for all offences committed by them, which was
  necessary, that God might appear to be just, in justifying all them that
  believe: nor is this any objection or contradiction to the free grace of God,
  in a sinner's justification; since it was grace in God to provide, send, and
  part with his Son as a Redeemer, and to work out righteousness; it was grace
  in Christ, to come and give himself a sacrifice, and obtain salvation and
  righteousness, not for angels, but for men, and for some of them, and not all;
  and whatever this righteousness, salvation, and redemption cost Christ, they
  are all free to men.
</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#025">Romans 3:25</a></p>
<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">rom 3:25</a></font></span
  >
</p>
Whom God had set forth to be a propitiation,.... Redemption by Christ is here
further explained, by his being "a propitiation": which word may design either
Christ the propitiator, the author of peace and reconciliation; or the
propitiatory sacrifice, by which he is so; and both in allusion to the mercy
seat, which was a type of him as such. The apostle here uses the same word,
which the Septuagint often render "the mercy seat", by; and Philo the Jew calls
it by the same name, and says it was a symbol, "of the propitious power of God"
(b). Christ is the propitiation to God for sin; which must be understood of his
making satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people; these were
imputed to him, and being found on him, the law and justice of God made demands
on him for them; which he answered to satisfaction, by his obedience and
sacrifice; and which, as it could not be done by any other, nor in any other
way, is expressed by "reconciliation", and "atonement": whence God may be said
to be pacified, or made propitious; not but that he always loved his people, and
never hated them; nor is there, nor can there be any change in God, from hatred
to love, any more than from love to hatred: Christ has not, by his sacrifice and
death, procured the love and favour of God, but has removed the obstructions
which lay in the way of love's appearing and breaking forth; there was, a law
broken, and justice provoked, which were to be attended to, and Christ by his
sacrifice has satisfied both; so that neither the wrath of God, nor any of the
effects of it, can fall upon the persons Christ is the propitiation for, even
according to justice itself; so that it is not love, but justice that is made
propitious: for this is all owing to the grace and goodness of God, who "hath
set him forth", for this intent, in his eternal purposes and decrees; in the
promises of the Old Testament, in the types, shadows, and sacrifices of the old
law; by the exhibition of him in our nature, and in the ministration of the
Gospel; and this is said to be
<p></p>
<p>
  through faith in his blood. The "blood" of Christ is that, by which Christ is
  the propitiation; for without the shedding of that blood, there is no
  redemption, no peace, no reconciliation, or remission of sin; and "faith" in
  his blood is the means by which persons become partakers of the benefits of
  his propitiation; such as peace, pardon, atonement, justification, and
  adoption: and the end of Christ's being set forth as a propitiation, on the
  part of God's people, is,
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God: by
  "sins that are past", are meant, not sins before baptism, nor the sins of a
  man's life only, but the sins of Old Testament saints, who lived before the
  incarnation of Christ, and the oblation of his sacrifice; and though this is
  not to be restrained to them only, for Christ's blood was shed for the
  remission of all his people's sins, past, present, and to come; yet the sins
  of the saints before the coming of Christ, seem to be particularly designed;
  which shows the insufficiency of legal sacrifices, sets forth the efficacy of
  Christ's blood and sacrifice, demonstrates him to be a perfect Saviour, and
  gives us reason under the present dispensation to hope for pardon, since
  reconciliation is completely made: "remission" of sin does not design that
  weakness which sin has brought upon, and left in human nature, whereby it is
  so enfeebled, that it cannot help itself, and therefore Christ was set forth,
  and sent forth, to be a propitiation; but rather God's passing by, or
  overlooking sin, and not punishing for it, under the former dispensation; or
  else the forgiveness of it now, and redemption from it by the blood of Christ,
  "through the forbearance of God"; in deferring the execution of justice, till
  he sent his Son, and in expecting satisfaction of his Son; which shows the
  grace and goodness of God to his people, and the trust and confidence he put
  in his Son: the other end on the part of God, in setting forth Christ to be a
  propitiation, was
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  to declare his righteousness
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#031">Psa 22:31</a>; meaning either the
  righteousness of Christ, which was before hid, but now manifested; or rather
  the righteousness of God the Father, his faithfulness in his promises relating
  to Christ, his grace and goodness in the mission of his Son, the holiness and
  purity of his nature, and his vindictive justice, in avenging sin in his own
  Son, as the surety of his people: the execution of this was threatened from
  the beginning; the types and sacrifices of the old law prefigured it; the
  prophecies of the Old Testament express it; and the sufferings and death of
  Christ openly declare it, since God spared not his own Son, but sheathed the
  sword of justice in him.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) Philo de Vita Mosis, l. 3. p. 668.</p>

    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">rom 3:26</a></font></span
  >
</p>
To declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness,.... This end is further
explained, it being to declare the righteousness of God "at this time", under
the Gospel dispensation; in which there was such a display of the grace, mercy,
and goodness of God:
<p></p>
<p>
  that he might be just; that is, appear to be so: God is naturally and
  essentially just in himself; and he is evidentially so in all his works,
  particularly in redemption by Christ; and when and while he is
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus: Jesus, the Saviour, is the
  object of faith, as he is the Lord our righteousness; the believer in Jesus is
  a real, and not a nominal one; God is the justifier of such in a declarative
  way, and God only, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit; and
  which sentence of justification is pronounced by him on the foot of a perfect
  righteousness, which neither law nor justice can find fault with, but entirely
  approve of; and so he appears just and righteous, even though he justifies the
  sinner and the ungodly.
</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027">Romans 3:27</a></p>
<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">rom 3:27</a></font></span
  >
</p>
Where is boasting then?.... There is no room nor reason for it, either in Jews
or Gentiles: not in the Jews, who were very apt to boast of their being
Abraham's seed; of their circumcision; of their being Israelites; of their
having and keeping the law; of God being their God; and of their knowledge of
him: nor in the Gentiles, who were ready to boast of their philosophy, wisdom,
and learning; of their self-sufficiency, freewill, and of the things they had in
their own power.
<p></p>
<p>
  It is excluded; it is shut out of doors; the key is turned upon it; it is not
  allowed of; it is entirely exploded:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  by what law? of works? nay; for, that establishes boasting when men seek life,
  righteousness, and salvation by the works of it, and fancy they shall be able
  to attain them this way:
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  but by the law of faith: not by a law requiring faith; nor as if the Gospel
  was a law, a new law, a remedial law, a law of milder terms; but the word
  "law" here answers to the Hebrew word which signifies any "doctrine" or
  "instruction", and oftentimes the doctrine of the Gospel, as in
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003">Isa 2:3</a>, and here particularly,
  the doctrine of a sinner's justification by faith in the righteousness of
  Christ; according to which doctrine the most unlikely persons are justified,
  even ungodly persons, the worst and vilest of sinners; and that without any
  consideration of works, by faith only, which is freely given them; and by
  faith in Christ's righteousness only: so that there is not the least room for
  boasting in the creature, but all their boasting is in Christ, who is made
  unto them righteousness, and by whom they are justified.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="margnote"
    ><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">rom 3:28</a></font></span
  >
</p>
Therefore we conclude,.... This is the conclusion from the premises, the sum
total of the whole account:
<p></p>
<p>
  that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. The subject of
  justification is, "man", not in opposition to angels; nor does it design the
  Jew against the Gentile, though some have so thought; but the apostle names
  neither Jew nor Gentile, but "man", to show that Christ's righteousness is
  unto all, and every man, that believes, be he who he will; and is to be
  understood indefinitely, that every man that is justified is justified by
  faith. The means is "by faith", not habitually or actually considered; that
  is, either as an habit and principle infused into us, or as an act performed
  by us; but either organically, as it is a means of receiving Christ's
  righteousness; or objectively, as it denotes Christ the object of it: and all
  this is done "without works", of any sort; not by a faith which is without
  works, for such a faith is dead, and of no avail; but by faith without works
  joined to it, in the affair of justification; or by the righteousness of
  Christ imputed by God the Father, without any consideration of them, and
  received by faith, and relied upon by the believer, without any regard unto
  them.

Is he the God of the Jews only?.... The Jews made their boast of him as such,
and would not allow the Gentiles any interest in him: but
<p></p>
<p>
  is he not also of the Gentiles? yes, of the Gentiles also: God is the God both
  of Jews and Gentiles; not only as the Creator, preserver, and Governor of
  them, or as he has a right to demand worship and service of them, but as he is
  their covenant God; not by virtue of the covenant of circumcision, or by the
  Sinai Covenant, but by the covenant of grace; as appears by his loving them in
  Christ, choosing them in him, putting them into his hands, providing blessings
  of grace for them in him, and sending his Son to redeem them; by calling them
  by his grace; by their sanctification, adoption, pardon, and justification; by
  taking out of them a people for his name with whom he dwells, and of whom he
  takes care; and will never leave nor forsake: all which may lead us to observe
  the distinguishing grace of God, the happiness of our state and condition, and
  what encouragement we have for faith and hope in God.

Seeing it is one God,.... God is one in nature and essence, though there are
three persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; whence it appears,
that he that is the God of the Jews, is also the God of the Gentiles, or there
would be more gods than one; and that these are justified in one and the same
manner, or God must be divided; for God, as he is one in nature, so he is one in
will, in his promises, and in the methods of his grace:
<p></p>
<p>
  which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through
  faith. The objects of justification are "the circumcision", the circumcised
  Jews, and "the uncircumcision", the uncircumcised Gentiles; the circumcision
  of the one does not forward, and the uncircumcision of the other does not
  hinder, nor neither of them effect the grace of justification: the justifier
  of them is one and the same, who is God; and the matter of their justification
  is the same, which is the righteousness of Christ; and the manner of it, or
  the means of their comfortable apprehension of it, is the same; for those
  phrases, "by faith", and "through faith", mean one and the same thing; see
  <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009">Phi 3:9</a>.

Do we then make void the law through faith?.... Which question is answered by
way of detestatation,
<p></p>
<p>God forbid! and by asserting the contrary,</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  yea, we establish the law. The law is not made void, neither by the grace nor
  doctrine of faith: not by the grace of faith; for that faith is not right
  which is not attended with works of righteousness; and those works are not
  right which do not flow from filth. Such a connection there is between faith
  and works; and so much do the one depend upon the other. Moreover, none but
  believers are capable of performing good works aright, and they do them, and
  they ought to do them: besides, faith, as a grace, looks to Christ, as the end
  of the law for righteousness, and therefore do not make it void. Nor is it
  made void by the doctrine of faith, and by the particular doctrine of a
  sinner's justification by faith in Christ's righteousness, which is here more
  especially intended; for though it is made void by it, as to any use of it for
  justification by the deeds thereof; yet its use in other respects is not set
  aside, such as to inform us of the mind and will of God, to discover and
  convince of sin, to show believers their deformity and imperfection, to render
  Christ and his righteousness more valuable, and to be a rule of walk and
  conversation to them; and it still remains a cursing and condemning law to
  Christless sinners, though justified ones are delivered from it as such: yea,
  the law is so far from being made void, that it is established by this
  doctrine; for by it the perpetuity of it is asserted, the spirituality of it
  is acknowledged, the perfect righteousness of it is secured: according to this
  doctrine all its demands are answered; whatever it requires it has, such as
  holiness of nature, perfect obedience to its precepts, and its full penalty
  borne: it is placed in the best hands, where it will ever remain; and a regard
  to it is enforced under the best influence, by the best of motives, and from
  the best of principles. It is indeed abolished as a covenant of works, and in
  this sense is made void to believers; and it is done away as to the form of
  administration of it by Moses; and it is destroyed as a yoke of bondage; and
  the people of God are free from the malediction of it, and condemnation by it,
  and so from its terror; yet it remains unalterable and unchangeable in the
  hands of Christ; the matter of it is always the same, and ever obligatory on
  believers, who, though they are freed from the curse of it, are not exempted
  from obedience to it: wherefore the law is not made void, so as to be
  destroyed and abolished in every sense, or to be rendered idle, inactive,
  useless, and insignificant; but, on the contrary, is made to stand, is placed
  on a sure basis and firm foundation, as the words used signify.
