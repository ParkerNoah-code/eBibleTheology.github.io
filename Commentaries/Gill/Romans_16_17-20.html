      Now I beseech you, brethren,.... The apostle being about to finish his
      epistle, and recollecting that he had not given this church any
      instructions about the false teachers, who had been the cause of all their
      differences and uneasiness, inserts them here; or he purposely put them in
      this place, amidst his salutations, that they might be taken the more
      notice of; and very pertinently, since nothing could more express his
      great affection and tender concern for them; and these instructions he
      delivers to them, not in an authoritative way, as he might, and sometimes
      did, but by way of entreaty, beseeching them, and with the kind and loving
      appellation of brethren, the more to engage them to attend to what he was
      about to say to them:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which
        ye have learned. The men he would have taken notice of were such who
        divided them in their religious sentiments, introducing heterodox
        notions, contrary to the doctrine of the Scriptures, of Christ and his
        apostles, and which they had learned from them; such as justification by
        the works of the law, the observance of Jewish days, and abstinence from
        meats, enjoined by the ceremonial law, and that as necessary to
        salvation; to which some gave heed, and others not, and so were divided;
        whereas the doctrine of faith is but one, the Gospel is one uniform
        thing, all of a piece; and those that profess it ought to be perfectly
        joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment: hence their
        minds were alienated from each other, and they began to despise and
        judge one another, yea, to go into factions and parties, being unwilling
        to receive and admit each other to communion; and thus by these men they
        were divided in sentiments, affection, and worship; and which must needs
        cause offence to the church and the godly members of it, as well as
        cause many so to be offended, as to stumble and fall from the doctrine
        of faith, and profession of it, and greatly stagger and distress weak
        believers, and bring a scandal on religion, and the name and ways of
        Christ among the world, as nothing does more so than the jars and
        discords among Christians: wherefore the apostle advises to "mark" such
        persons, look out for, narrowly watch, strictly observe, and diligently
        examine them: the metaphor is taken from watchmen, who look out from
        their watch tower, and observe who are coming, or pass by, and take up
        suspicious persons, and carefully inquire who they are, and what they
        are about, and whether friends or foes. So both ministers of the Gospel,
        and members of churches, should not be asleep, which is the opportunity
        false teachers take to sow the seeds of false doctrine, discord, and
        contention, but should watch, and be upon their guard, and look
        diligently, that none among them fail of, or fall from, the doctrine of
        grace, or any root of bitterness, error, or heresy as well as
        immorality, spring up, which may be troublesome, and defile others; they
        should observe, and take notice of such who are busy to spread false
        doctrine, should watch their motions, follow them closely, take them to
        an account, examine their principles according to the word of God; and
        if found to be contrary thereunto, note them as false teachers:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and avoid them; shun their ministry, drop attendance on it, depart far
        from them, have no private conversation with them, receive them not into
        their houses, nor bid them God speed; with such do not eat, have no
        communion with them at the Lord's table, withdraw from them as
        disorderly persons, who act contrary to the doctrine and order of the
        Gospel, and after proper admonition reject them from all fellowship with
        you.

      For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,.... They do not
      preach him, but themselves; they do not seek the things of Christ, his
      honour and glory, the spread of his Gospel, and the enlargement of his
      kingdom and interest; they seek their own things, worldly honour and
      applause, riches, wealth, and grandeur; they seek to please men, and so
      are not the servants of Christ: they introduced the observance of meats
      and drinks in to the kingdom of Christ, which it do not consist of, and
      neglected the doctrines of righteousness and peace, from whence springs
      joy in the Holy Ghost, and so in these spiritual things did not serve
      Christ; and therefore, as they were not acceptable to God, were not to be
      approved of by Christian men, but to be marked and avoided:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but their own belly; which they made a god of, and devoted themselves to
        the service of all their views were to gratify and indulge their sensual
        appetite. The false teachers among the Jews were particularly addicted
        to this vice: hence the apostle sometimes calls them dogs,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002">Phi 3:2</a>, on account of
        their voraciousness, and who, in Isaiah's time, were greedy ones that
        could never have enough,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011">Isa 56:11</a>; and in our
        Lord's time devoured widows' houses, under a pretence of long prayers
        for them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#014">Mat 23:14</a>; and
        were like the Cretians, evil beasts, and slow bellies,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012">Tit 1:12</a>, unwilling to
        labour, and lived upon the spoil of others:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and by good words, and fair speeches, deceive the hearts of the simple:
        they were deceivers; they lay in wait to deceive, made use of the hidden
        things of dishonesty, walked in craftiness, and handled the word of God
        deceitfully; and therefore to be marked and avoided: they deceived "the
        simple", harmless, and innocent, that think no evil, nor are aware of
        any; who have little understanding of things; persons of weak minds,
        easy to be imposed upon; very credulous, ready to believe every word, so
        the simple man does, as Solomon says,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#015">Pro 14:15</a>; and such false
        teachers choose to tamper with, and make their attacks upon, being able
        to gain upon them the most easily, as their father the devil, the old
        serpent, did, when he first assailed human nature: the "hearts" of these
        they deceive; they work upon their affections, blind their
        understandings, impose on their judgments, and corrupt their minds from
        the simplicity that is in Christ: and this they do "by good words and
        fair speeches"; either by making use of the words of Scripture, and a
        show of arguments taken from thence; so Satan cited Scripture in his
        dispute with our Lord; and so heretics, in all ages, have pretended toil
        in favour of their principles, by which means they have gained on many
        to follow their pernicious ways; or by using words and phrases that
        faithful ministers of Christ use, such as the grace of God, the
        righteousness of Christ, the Spirit of Christ, but in a different sense;
        as some among us now frequently make mention of them, when they mean no
        more by them than the light of nature within them, and the dictates of a
        natural conscience; or by an elegant style, a set of fine words, a flow
        of rhetorical expressions, great swelling words of vanity, which such
        men generally affect, and so work themselves into the admiration of the
        common people; or by doctrines suited to the carnal minds and reasonings
        of men, which tickle human nature, and swell it with pride and vanity;
        as by preaching up the purity and power of it, asserting man's free
        will, and the strength of it to that which is good; the capacity of man
        to keep the law, and perform good works; justification by them before
        God, and acceptance with him, on account of them; atonement for sins
        committed, by repentance and reformation; that God does not regard
        trifling things, some sins are venial, and easily passed over; that
        concupiscence is no sin; God does not rigorously exact duty, he takes
        the will for the deed, and is merciful unto all, and if but sincere,
        there is no doubt of heaven; and such men, generally speaking, instead
        of correcting vice, and reproving men for their sins, connive at them,
        indulge them in them, soothe and flatter, commend and defend them,
        whereby they attach them to their persons and interest.

      For your obedience is come abroad unto all men,.... That is, as the Arabic
      and Ethiopic versions render it, "the fame" and report of their obedience
      to the faith, to the doctrine of the Gospel, and the ministers of it, was
      spread everywhere, was well known to everyone, and spoken of with
      commendeth among all the churches in all nations: and this the apostle
      mentions as another reason why they should beware of false teachers, since
      it would be greatly to their reproach, should they, after all this, drop
      that form of doctrine which they had obeyed, desert the faithful ministers
      of the word, and follow these false teachers; should this be the case,
      they would be as notorious for their disobedience, as now for their
      obedience: and moreover, the apostle might hereby suggest, that whereas it
      was everywhere known how readily and at once they embraced the Gospel of
      Christ; this credulity and readiness to believe, which was their
      commendation, might have invited false teachers among them, who might hope
      and take encouragement from hence the more easily to gain upon them; and
      therefore they ought to be upon their watch and guard, and beware of them,
      and not believe every spirit:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        I am glad therefore on your behalf; that they had so cheerfully and
        readily embraced the Gospel, and from the heart obeyed that form of
        doctrine delivered to them; and that their praise for this was in all
        the churches of Christ, and had everywhere a good report on this
        account:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple
        concerning evil; which is just the reverse of natural and unregenerate
        men, who are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge;
        some reference seems to be had to the words of Christ in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016">Mat 10:16</a>; the apostle's
        meaning is, that though he rejoiced at the heartiness and simplicity of
        their obedience, and the credit they obtained abroad on account of it,
        yet was he not without his fears and jealousies concerning them; and
        could not but greatly wish them more wisdom to understand the doctrines
        of the Gospel, to discern things that differ, and approve that which is
        the most excellent, and hold fast that which is good; and with all their
        harmlessness, innocence, and simplicity, prudently guard against all
        evil doctrines and principles, such as might unawares lead them into bad
        practices, dishonourable to religion, and uncomfortable to themselves.

      And the God of peace,.... See Gill on
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#033">Rom 15:33</a>;
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. Some read this by way of
        wish or prayer, "may the God of peace bruise"; so the Vulgate Latin,
        Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, and the Alexandrian copy; but others as
        ours, as a promise, or as expressive of the apostle's faith and hope in
        this matter; and which he mentions to encourage the members of this
        church to be upon their guard, and make head against these false
        teachers; since in a little time they might be assured of victory over
        Satan and these his emissaries: as it is before suggested, that the
        methods these men used to beguile weak minds were much like those that
        Satan used when he attacked our first parents, so here is a manifest
        allusion to what was said by way of threatening to him, "it", the
        woman's seed, "shall bruise thy head",
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#015">Gen 3:15</a>; and which has
        had its accomplishment in Christ, who has not only destroyed the works
        of the devil, but him himself, and spoiled his principalities and
        powers, and bruised him and them under his feet, when he led captivity
        captive; and though, for the trial of the graces of his people, Satan is
        permitted to attack them in various shapes, yet in a short time he will
        be bruised under their feet, as he is already under their Lord and
        master's. The apostle refers not so much to his coming among them in a
        short time, when he might hope and believe that he should be an
        instrument of crushing these men Satan made use of, of quelling the
        contentions they raised, and putting a stop to the divisions they made,
        and under the influence, and by the assistance of the God of peace,
        restore them to their former peace and tranquillity, though it is a
        sense not to be despised; much less does he refer to the destruction of
        Jerusalem, which was to be in a very short time, when the crucifiers of
        Christ and the persecutors of the saints would have the wrath of God
        come upon them to the uttermost, since these Romans had no great and
        immediate concern with them; nor does he regard the spread of the Gospel
        in the Gentile world, whereby Satan fell as lightning from heaven, and
        was cast out of the idol temples, for this was greatly fulfilled
        already: but rather he refers to the time of Constantine, when Satan's
        seat at Rome was overturned, when he was cast down from his throne and
        trampled under feet, who had deceived the whole world, the whole Roman
        empire, when the Gospel triumphed over its secret and open enemies,
        profane persecutors, and perfidious teachers, over idolatry and
        superstition on the one hand, and error and heresy on the other, though
        this did not last long; wherefore some have thought the apostle refers
        to the latter day, when Satan shall be bound a thousand years, or to the
        last of all, when he shall be for ever under the feet of the saints, and
        never be able to give them any more trouble; and this the apostle might
        say would be shortly, since the second coming of Christ was expected to
        be quickly: yea, this may be applied to the case of every believer now,
        and be for his encouragement to be vigilant and on his guard against
        Satan, to resist him, repel his temptations, and oppose his emissaries;
        since he may assure himself he shall be more than a conqueror over him
        through Christ, that has loved him, and that in a very little time, when
        death comes, and he shall enter into the joy of his Lord, where he will
        be out of the reach of Satan, and unmolested by him.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Amen: to enable you to
        abide by the truth; to mark and avoid the authors of sects, and causes
        of divisions, and offences; to oppose error and defend truth; to keep
        from falling, to stand against every assault of Satan, and to bear up
        under every temptation of his; to get the victory over him, and to
        preserve them safe to the kingdom and glory of Christ.
