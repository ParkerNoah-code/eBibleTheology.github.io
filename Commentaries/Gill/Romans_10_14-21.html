      How then shall they call on him in whom they, have not believed?.... The
      apostle having observed, that whoever, Jew or Gentile, believe in the Lord
      and call upon his name, shall be saved; and that the same Lord was ready
      and willing to dispense his grace, without any difference to them;
      suggests, that it was therefore absolutely necessary, that the Gospel
      should be preached to the Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; that it was
      the will of God it should be; that what he and others did, was by a divine
      commission; that they were sent by the Lord to preach the Gospel to them;
      that hearing they might believe, and so call upon the name of the Lord,
      and be saved; and therefore the Jews ought not to blame them for so doing,
      for there was a real necessity for it, since there can be no true calling
      upon God without faith, no faith without hearing, no hearing without
      preaching, and no preaching without a divine mission. The first of these
      is signified by this interrogation. Every man calls upon the God he
      believes in, and him only; this has been the practice of all men, in all
      nations; such as have not believed in God and Christ, do not call upon
      them; it is true indeed, there may be an external invocation of them,
      where there is no true faith; but then this is not calling upon them in
      truth and sincerity; as is their faith, so is their calling upon them; as
      the one is historical, the other is only external; there is no true
      invocation without faith, or any that is acceptable to God, or of any
      avail to men; for calling on the name of the Lord, as it ought to be
      practised in all religious worship, so it includes and every part of
      worship as done in faith:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? the
        meaning is, that there is no faith in Christ without hearing of him; as
        it is in human, so in divine faith, there may be believing without
        seeing, but not without hearing; so we believe that there were such men
        as Alexander and Julius Caesar, and other persons now in being, though
        we never saw them, having heard of them, or had a report made of them,
        which we have reason to give credit to; so there may be, and is faith in
        Christ without seeing him with our bodily eyes, though not without
        hearing of him; for of an unheard of person, there can be no faith in
        him, because no exercise of thought about him. This is to be understood
        of outward hearing of the word, and of adult persons only; for that,
        infants may have the grace of regeneration, and so faith wrought in them
        by the Spirit of God, without hearing the word, is not to be denied;
        since as they are capable of the principles of corruption, why not of
        grace? and also of such persons as have the right and free exercise of
        the faculties of hearing and speaking, and not of such who never could
        hear, and speak; for as the Spirit works where, and how he pleases, so
        he can work faith in the hearts of such persons who never heard the
        word, and enable them to exercise it on the proper object, and cause
        them secretly to call upon the name of the Lord, with groans which
        cannot be uttered. Moreover, this is to be, understood of the ordinary
        way and means of believing; for though God can, and sometimes does work
        by other means, and even without any, yet his usual way and method is,
        to bring men to faith and repentance by the hearing of the word:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and how shall they hear without a preacher? or there is no hearing
        without, preaching; there may be reading without it, and this ought to
        be where there is preaching, to see that what is preached is agreeably
        to the Scriptures; but there is no hearing the word explained without
        preaching; explaining the word is preaching. There is no hearing of
        Christ, and salvation by him, without the preaching of the Gospel; the
        usual and ordinary way of hearing from God, and of Christ, is by the
        ministry of the word: this shows not only the necessity and usefulness
        of the Gospel ministry, but also points out the subject matter of it,
        which is Christ, and him crucified. They that preach ought to preach
        concerning the person of Christ, his offices, grace, righteousness,
        blood, sacrifice and satisfaction, otherwise men may hear the preacher,
        and not hear Christ.

      And how shall they preach, except they be sent,.... There is no proper,
      rightful, regular, and lawful preaching of the word without a mission,
      which is either extraordinary, or ordinary; extraordinary mission was such
      as the apostles themselves had; who, as they were called to extraordinary
      service, had extraordinary qualifications, and were sent forth in an
      extraordinary manner, with a power of doing miracles, and immediately by
      Christ himself. Ordinary mission is of men to be pastors and teachers,
      which includes qualifications for the ministerial work; for whom Christ
      sends forth into such service, he bestows gifts on them, fitting them for
      it, some more, some less, but all have some; and it also includes a call
      unto it, which is either internal, and by the Spirit of God, and lies
      partly in the furniture he gives, and the inclination of the heart to this
      good work which he forms; and which arises not from a vanity of mind, and
      a desire of popular applause, and worldly views, and sinister ends; but
      from a real concern for the good of souls, and the glory of Christ, being
      willing to deny themselves, and forsake all for Christ, to suitor reproach
      for his name's sake, and to forego all worldly interest, and secular
      views: or is external, which is given by the churches of Christ, after due
      trial and examination of gifts, and a serious consideration of the matter,
      and that in the most solemn manner; and this is what may be properly
      called a preacher's mission, and none but such who are in this way sent
      out ought to preach the Gospel: and to such well agrees, and may be
      applied, that passage in
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007">Isa 52:7</a>, where
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel
        of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things; which words are not to
        be understood of the messengers that brought the tidings of deliverance
        from the Babylonish captivity, but of the ministers of the Gospel. In
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007">Isa 52:7</a> it is expressed
        in the singular number, "how beautiful are the feet of him", &amp;c. and
        is by some understood of Christ, as it is also by many Jewish writers:
        thus interpreting the "turtle's voice" in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#012">Sol 2:12</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "this (say they (a)) is the voice of the King Messiah, proclaiming and
        saying, "how beautiful on the mountains", &amp;c.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And elsewhere (b) it is observed, that the</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "Rabbins say, great is peace, for when the King Messiah comes, he does
        not open but with peace, as it is said, "how beautiful upon the
        mountains", &amp;c.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>And says (c) another,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "one verse says, "how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him
        that bringeth good tidings", , "the explanation", or meaning is, the
        King Messiah:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and some of the more, modern ones (d) of them, own these words are, ,
        "concerning the redemption, and the coming of the Messiah": and so the
        worlds, however they may principally regard the Messiah and his
        ministry, are property applied to the apostles of Christ; and may be
        rightly understood of any minister of the Gospel, whose business it is
        to "preach the Gospel of peace": which is so called from the subject
        matter of it, peace made by the blood of Christ, which it proclaims;
        from the effect of it, producing, peace and tranquillity in distressed
        minds, and making men of peaceable dispositions; and from the use of it,
        which is to direct men to the way of peace, to guide their feet in it,
        lead them to eternal peace: their work is also to "bring glad tidings of
        good things"; such as reconciliation, righteousness, pardon, life, and
        eternal salvation, by a crucified Christ; and the preaching of such a
        Gospel, and bringing such news, make their "feet beautiful": one should
        have thought rather their lips than their feet would be took notice of;
        the reason of this is, partly because of the agreeableness of their walk
        and conversation to the doctrine they preach; and partly because of
        their readiness to preach it everywhere, though they run the utmost risk
        in so doing; and also because of their swiftness, particularly of the
        apostles, in going through the cities of Israel, and running over the
        Gentile world with the Gospel of peace, in so short a time as they did;
        and more especially because of the acceptableness of their message, with
        which they were sent and ran; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2018.htm#027">Sa2 18:27</a>. And so this
        passage is pertinently alleged to prove, that mission is necessary to
        preaching; since these words declare the character of Gospel ministers,
        as publishers of peace, and messengers of good tidings; and express the
        message itself, and the nature of it; both which suppose them to be sent
        by another, even the Lord, under whose authority, and by whose warrant
        they act; just as ambassadors, heralds, and messengers do, by virtue of
        a commission they receive from their prince.

      But they have not all obeyed the Gospel,.... Who hear it, and to whom it
      is preached; for though ministers may be regularly sent forth, and rightly
      preach the Gospel in the purity of it, yet there is no success without the
      power of God attending it: ministers may preach, and men may hear, and yet
      not obey the Gospel; that is, cordially embrace the doctrines, and
      sincerely submit to the ordinances of it:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report; or "our hearing",
        agreeably to the Hebrew word in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001">Isa 53:1</a>, and which
        designs not the "hearing" with which the apostles heard Christ, though
        what they heard from him, they made known to men; but the hearing, or
        the word heard, which others had from them, namely, the report they made
        in their ministry, of the person and grace of Christ, which was
        disregarded, when the arm and power of the Lord were not, revealed and
        exerted: this was the case of the Jews in Isaiah's time, and the same in
        the times of Christ and his apostles, and is always the case, when
        divine power does not attend the preaching of the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p align="center">

      </p>
      So then faith comes by hearing,.... That is, by preaching; for the word
      hearing is used in the same sense as in the preceding verse; and designs
      the report of the Gospel, or the preaching of the word, which is the means
      God makes use of, to convey faith into the hearts of his people; for
      preachers are ministers, or instruments, by whom others believe:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and hearing by the word of God; or "of Christ", as some copies read, and
        so do the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions; and intends either the
        holy Scriptures, which have God for their author, and Christ for the
        subject of them; and which furnish the men of God, or ministers of the
        Gospel, with proper materials to preach; and so hearing or preaching is
        by them, or else the command of God or Christ, which more properly
        signifies; and the sense is, that men preach the Gospel in obedience to
        the commandment of the everlasting God, and according to the orders,
        mission, and commission, warrant and authority, of the Lord Jesus
        Christ: and so these words are the conclusion, and sum of the whole;
        that as invocation is owing to faith, so faith to hearing, hearing to
        preaching, preaching to a mission; whence it follows, that it is the
        original will of God, to send forth his apostles and ministers, to
        preach the Gospel to the Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; that they
        hearing might believe, and believing call upon the Lord, and so be saved
        by him: it is a saying of the Jews, , "hearing depends upon the word"
        (e).

      </p>
      But I say, have they not heard?.... , "but I say", is a phrase frequently
      used by the Jewish doctors in disputation, either in forming or answering
      objections. The Ethiopic version confines these words to Israel, and
      reads, "have not Israel heard?" whereas they are to be understood both of
      Jews and Gentiles; the question refers to each, and the answer is,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        yes, verily: which the Arabic renders just the reverse, "no", or "not at
        all, notwithstanding their sound went into all the earth"; and so makes
        this an aggravation of their stupidity, and obstinate rejection of the
        Gospel, that they would not hear it, though its sound reached every
        place; but the answer is in the affirmative, they did hear. The Jews
        heard the Gospel in the times of Isaiah, and other prophets, though they
        disbelieved the report of it; they heard it from John the Baptist, and
        were pleased with his ministry for a while; yea, they heard Christ
        himself preach it, who spake as never man did, with power and authority,
        as the Scribes did not, and wondered at his gracious words; they heard
        the apostles of Christ, who for some time were limited in their ministry
        to them only, and after their commission was enlarged, were ordered to
        preach first to them; so that they could not say they had not heard it,
        and they were left entirely inexcusable. The Gentiles also had heard it;
        the apostles were bid to go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to
        every creature; and at a proper opportunity, they did as the Lord
        commanded them, and the Gentiles heard the Gospel with joy and pleasure;
        multitudes were converted everywhere, and churches raised through their
        ministry, according to the will of God; thus
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of
        the world; the passage referred to is
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004">Psa 19:4</a>, which some here,
        as there, understand literally of the works of nature, the heavens, the
        firmament, the sun, moon and stars, proclaiming every where the being of
        God, his perfections, especially his wisdom, power, and goodness; so
        that the Gentiles were not without hearing of God, even whilst they were
        destitute of a divine revelation; which was a sort of a prelude of the
        after extensive spread of the Gospel among them: a voice, or sound, is
        ascribed to the inanimate creatures; and which is so loud, that it
        reaches to the end of the earth. There are three voices, the Jews say
        (f) which go "from one end of the world to the other"; and one of them
        is , "the voice of the orb of the sun": others understand these words of
        the law, of which many "encomiums" are given in the psalm from whence
        this passage is taken; and though it was delivered peculiarly to the
        people of the Jews, yet the fame of it reached the nations of the world,
        as Moses suggests it would,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#006">Deu 4:6</a>; and the Jews say
        (g).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that when the law was given to Israel, , "its voice went from one end
        of the world to the other".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Or as it is better expressed by Philo (h), and almost in the words of
        this text,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "the fame of the laws which Moses left, is gone throughout all the
        world, unto the ends of the earth.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        But certain it is, that the apostle is speaking neither of the light of
        nature, nor the law of Moses, but of the preaching of the Gospel; and
        what the Psalmist, literally understood, says of the heavens, that the
        apostle in an allegorical and mystical sense, or by an argument from the
        lesser to the greater, or by way of allusion, applies to the apostles
        and ministers of the Gospel, the luminaries of the world, and stars of
        heaven; whose ministry, by this time, had reached the then known parts
        of the habitable world; as it was to do, before the destruction of
        Jerusalem, according to Christ's prediction (Mat 24:14) and as the
        Apostle Paul testifies it had (Col 1:6) and in which he
        himself had a very considerable share, having preached the Gospel from
        Jerusalem, round about unto Illyricum. There is some little difference
        between the passage in the Psalms, and as cited or referred to by the
        apostle, who instead of "their line", reads "their sound"; which have
        made some suspect a corruption of the present Hebrew text, or a various
        reading; and that the Septuagint, followed by the apostle, used a copy
        which had not, "their line", but "their voice", and which was the true
        reading; but then how came the Chaldee paraphrase to render it by,
        "extension", and Aquila by "a canon", or "rule?" and besides, the Masora
        observes, that this word is no where else read, which is not true of for
        that often occurs; to which may be added, had this been the reading, the
        Septuagint would have rendered it most probably, as they do elsewhere,
        by "voice", and not "sound": but for the reconciliation of this let it
        be observed, that the Hebrew word signifies a rule, or plummet, or such
        a line as builders use in their work, as a direction to them, hence
        Kimchi (i) explains it by "their building"; and so it may signify any
        rule, or direction, whether given by writing, and so Aben Ezra (k)
        interprets it by "writing", or by word of mouth; besides, the
        carpenter's line, when stretched out, and remitted upon the timber,
        makes a sound, and hence the word might be used for one: all this agrees
        with the ministry of the apostles, who were builders; and as they worked
        by a line and rule themselves, so they gave out rules and directions to
        others, both by writing and preaching, both which reached far and near;
        this the apostle seems to allude to, in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#013">Co2 10:13</a>, where he speaks
        of the measure, line, and rule of their ministry, which reached to
        Corinth and further, without going into another man's line: moreover,
        that great Oriental critic, and our countryman, Mr. Pocock (l), has
        shown from the use of the word in the Arabic language, that the word in
        the Psalms may signify a loud cry, or noise, as well as a line, or rule;
        so that the psalmist and the apostle may be easily reconciled.

      But I say, did not Israel know? Some supply the word "God", did not Israel
      know God? verily, they did; they knew the being and perfections of God,
      the unity of God, and the trinity of persons in the divine essence; they
      knew the will of God, and the right way of worshipping him; for they were
      favoured with a divine revelation; to them were committed the oracles of
      God, and to them belonged the giving of the "Gospel", did not Israel know
      the Gospel? yes, they did; they not only heard it, but knew it; not
      spiritually and experimentally, but nationally and speculatively, and,
      against the light and conviction of their own minds, obstinately rejected
      it with contempt: but I rather think this question refers to the calling
      of the Gentiles, and their own rejection; and the sense is, did not Israel
      know, that the Gentiles were to be called by the grace of God, and that
      they themselves were to be cast off? they did know this, at least
      something of it, though not so clearly as it is now revealed to the holy
      apostles and prophets by the Spirit; but in some measure they could not
      but know it, since there were such strong hints of it in the writings of
      the Old Testament, some of which are hereafter produced:

        first Moses saith; not "Moses the first", as if there was another, or a
        second Moses, but either Moses, who is the first of the inspired
        writers, and chief of the prophets; or rather this regards order of
        time, Moses in the first place says so and so, for other testimonies are
        after cited; the passage in Moses referred to, is

        I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
        foolish nation I will anger you. The Gentiles are here designed by "them
        that are no people": who before God, and in his sight, as all nations
        are, were as a drop of the bucket, as the small dust of the balance:
        nay, even as nothing, yea, less than nothing and vanity: likewise they
        were no people of any account, of any name; they were mean and
        contemptible, neglected and overlooked by God himself, and treated with
        contempt by the Jews, his professing people: and besides, they were not
        as yet openly and visibly the people of God; they neither called upon
        his name, nor were they called by his name; he had not as yet taken from
        among them a people for his name: these are also meant by "the foolish
        nation"; Jarchi (m) says, the Cuthites, or Samaritans, are intended; who
        were neighbours to the Jews, and greatly hated by them: but it may more
        rightly be applied to all the Gentiles in general, who notwithstanding
        their large pretensions to natural, civil, and moral wisdom, yet being
        without a true knowledge of God, Christ, and the Gospel, were a foolish
        people; and in nothing more did their folly appear, than in their
        idolatry and superstition. Now the Lord threatened by these people to
        provoke the Jews to jealousy, and to anger them; and this was but just,
        and by way of retaliation; for since they provoked him to jealousy and
        anger, by worshipping strange gods, which plainly declared their want of
        faith in him, affection for him, and their departure from him; it was a
        righteous thing in him to provoke them to jealousy of him, as if he had
        no affection for them, who had been so long, in some sense, an husband
        to them all; and as about to cast them off; and to anger them, by
        sending his Gospel among the Gentiles, and calling them by his grace,
        and making them partakers of his special favours; whereby this prophecy
        had its full accomplishment: for though the Jews rejected and despised
        the Gospel themselves, yet nothing more provoked them than that it
        should be carried among the Gentiles; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#021">Act 22:21</a>. Now from these
        words of Moses, the Israelites must needs know, they could not but know
        that it was the will of God to call the Gentiles, and reject them.

      But Esaias is very bold, and saith,.... The apostle here produces another
      testimony in proof of this, that the Israelites must needs have some
      knowledge of this truth, the calling of the Gentiles; since a famous
      prophet of theirs, Isaiah, also spake out with great freedom; he did not
      mince the matter, or cover it with dark sayings, but with all plainness
      and perspicuity, and with great courage and intrepidity declared it;
      though he knew he run the risk, not only of his fame and credit among the
      Jews, but of his life also, for so doing: the citation is made from
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001">Isa 65:1</a>.

        I was found of them that sought me not, I was made manifest unto them
        that asked not after me; here also the Gentiles are meant by "them that
        sought me not, and asked not after me"; the Messiah; and so R. Moses the
        priest says (n), that these words are to be understood, , "concerning
        the nations of the world". The common people among them sought after the
        things of the world; their philosophers sought after the wisdom of it;
        and the more devout and religious among them sought the observance of
        superstitious rites and ceremonies, and, at best and most, a little
        morality and external righteousness; but none sought after Christ, for
        they knew nothing of him, and therefore did not so much as ask after
        him; they did not ask counsel of him, nor ask concerning him, nor ask
        for him; not for his coming into the world, as the Jews did, nor for the
        preaching of the Gospel among them, for it came among them unasked for,
        unexpected, and undesired, as well as undeserved by them, nor for any
        blessing of his; and yet such was his grace and goodness, that he was
        "found" of these persons, in the preaching of the Gospel; which by his
        kind providence was brought among them, and they were brought under the
        hearing of it; and by the Spirit of God directed to him in it, in whom
        they found life, peace, pardon, righteousness, food, and rest, and every
        valuable blessing; a pearl of great price they found, a finding which
        can never be lost: he is also said to be "made manifest" unto them, not
        in the flesh, but in the ministry of the word; in which his person,
        blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, are evidently set forth, and
        clearly manifested; and besides the outward manifestation of Christ to
        them by the Gospel, they had no internal revelation of him in their
        hearts by his Spirit, setting forth to them his grace and fulness, and
        showing them their interest therein: from this prophecy, also, the Jews
        could not but have some knowledge of this mystery of grace.

      But to Israel he saith,.... Or against Israel, or concerning Israel he

        All day long I have stretched forth my hands, unto a disobedient and
        gainsaying people: very rightly does the apostle apply these words to
        Israel, as he does the former to the Gentiles; and just in like manner
        does the above mentioned Jewish writer, R. Moses the priest, interpret
        them. The Lord's "stretching out his hands all the day long" to them,
        designs the ministry of the prophets one after another to them, the
        preaching of John the Baptist, of Christ and his apostles among them:
        but they were a stiffnecked and rebellious people, uncircumcised in
        heart and ears; would have none of his counsel, and despised his
        reproof; contradicted and blasphemed the word; rejected the Messiah and
        his Gospel; killed the Prince of life, and persecuted his apostles; so
        that it was just with God to write a "Lo-ammi", Hos_1:9, upon them, and
        cast them off; and, to pave the way for the account of the rejection of
        these people in the next chapter, is all this said, and these
        testimonies produced.
