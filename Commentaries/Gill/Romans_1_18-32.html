      For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven,.... The apostle having
      hinted at the doctrine of justification by faith in the righteousness of
      Christ; and which he designed more largely to insist upon in this epistle,
      and to prove that there can be no justification of a sinner in the sight
      of God by the deeds of the law, in order to set this matter in a clear
      light, from hence, to the end of the chapter, and in the following ones,
      represents the sad estate and condition of the Gentiles with the law of
      nature, and of the Jews with the law of Moses; by which it most clearly
      appears, that neither of them could be justified by their obedience to the
      respective laws under which they were, but that they both stood in need of
      the righteousness of God. By "the wrath of God" is meant the displicency
      and indignation of God at sin and sinners; his punitive justice, and awful
      vengeance; the judgments which he executes in this world; and that
      everlasting displeasure of his, and wrath to come in another world, which
      all through sin are deserving of, some are appointed to, God's elect are
      delivered from, through Christ's sustaining it, in their room and stead,
      and which comes and abides on all impenitent and unbelieving persons. This
      is said to be "revealed", where? not in the Gospel, in which the
      righteousness of God is revealed; unless the Gospel be taken for the books
      of the four Evangelists, or for the Gospel dispensation, or for that part
      of the ministry of a Gospel preacher, which represents the wrath of God as
      the desert of sin, the dreadfulness of it, and the way to escape it; for
      the Gospel, strictly taken, is grace, good news, glad tidings, and not
      wrath and damnation; though indeed in Christ's sufferings for the sins of
      his people, which the Gospel gives us an account of, there is a great
      display of the wrath of God, and of his indignation against sin: but this
      wrath of God is revealed in the law, it is known by the light of nature,
      and to be perceived in the law of Moses, and may be observed in the
      Scriptures, where are many instances and examples of divine wrath and
      displeasure; as in the total destruction of the old world by a world wide
      flood, the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah, turning Lot's wife into a pillar
      of salt, the plagues of Egypt, and the several instances mentioned in this
      chapter. This wrath is said to be God's wrath "from heaven", by the awful
      blackness which covers the heavens, the storms and tempests raised in
      them, and by pouring down water or fire in a surprising manner, on the
      inhabitants of the world; or "from heaven", that is, openly, manifestly,
      in the sight of all; or from God who is in heaven, and not from second
      causes; and more especially it will be revealed from heaven, when Christ
      shall descend from thence at the day of judgment: the subject matter or
      object of it,
      <p></p>
      <p>against, or "upon" which it is revealed, are,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men; that is, all ungodly and
        unrighteous men; or all men who are guilty of ungodliness, the breach of
        the first table of the law, which respects the worship of God, and of
        unrighteousness, the breach of the second table of the law, which
        regards our neighbours' good: and these persons are further described as
        such,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who hold the truth in unrighteousness: meaning either such who know the
        Gospel, which is "the truth", and do not profess it openly, but hold and
        imprison it in their minds, which is a great piece of unrighteousness;
        or if they do profess it, do not live up to it in their lives: or rather
        the Gentile philosophers are designed, who are spoken of in the
        following verse; See Gill on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#022">Rom 1:22</a>; who had some
        knowledge of the truth of the divine Being, and his perfections, and of
        the difference between moral good and evil; but did not like to retain
        it themselves, nor communicate all they knew to others, nor did they
        live according to that knowledge which they had.

      Because that which may be known of God,.... There are some things which
      could not be known of God by the light of nature; as a trinity of persons
      in the Godhead; the knowledge of God in Christ as Mediator; the God-man
      and Mediator Jesus Christ; his incarnation, sufferings, death, and
      resurrection; the will of God to save sinners by a crucified Jesus; the
      several peculiar doctrines of the Gospel, particularly the resurrection of
      the dead, and the manner of worshipping of God with acceptance: but then
      there are some things which may be known of God, without a revelation.
      Adam had a perfect knowledge of him; and his sons, though fallen, even the
      very Heathens have some notion of him, as that there is a God; and by the
      light of nature it might be known that there is but one God, who is
      glorious, full of majesty, and possessed of all perfections, as that he is
      all powerful, wise, good and righteous: and this
      <p></p>
      <p>
        is manifest in them, or "to them"; by the light that is given them: it
        is light by which that which may be known of God is manifest; and this
        is the light of nature, which every man has that comes into the world;
        and this is internal, it is in him, in his mind and conscience, and is
        communicated to him by God, and that by infusion or inspiration; see
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job032.htm#008">Job 32:8</a>;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for God hath showed it unto them; what may be known of him by that
        light; and which is assisted and may be improved by a consideration of
        the works of creation and Providence.

      </p>
      For the invisible things of him,.... Not the angels, the invisible
      inhabitants of heaven: nor the unseen glories of another world; nor the
      decrees of God; nor the persons in the Godhead; but the perfections of
      God, or his "properties", as the Arabic version reads it; and which are
      explained by "his eternal power and Godhead": these,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        from the creation of the world are clearly seen; this is no new
        discovery, but what men have had, and might, by the light of nature,
        have enjoyed ever since the world was created; these
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        being understood, in an intellectual way, by the discursive faculty of
        the understanding,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        by the things that are made; the various works of creation; all which
        proclaim the being, unity, and perfections of God their Creator,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        so that they are without excuse; the very Heathens, who have only the
        light of nature, and are destitute of a revelation, have no colour or
        pretext for their idolatrous practices, and vicious lives; nor have
        they, nor will they have anything to object to God's righteous judgment
        against them, or why they should not be condemned.

        >
      </p>
      Because that when they knew God,.... Though they had such a knowledge of
      the being and perfections of God, yet
      <p></p>
      <p>
        they glorified him not as God. They neither thought nor spoke honourably
        of him; nor did they ascribe those perfections to him, which belonged to
        him; they did not adhere to him as the one and only God, nor honour him
        as the Creator of all things out of nothing, and as the sole Governor of
        the universe; they did not glorify him by the internal exercise of fear
        of him, love to him, or trust in him, nor by any external worship
        suitable to his nature, and their own notions of him, Seneca is an
        instance of this, of whom Austin (f) says,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that he worshipped what he found fault with, did what he reproved, and
        adored that which he blamed.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Neither were thankful; neither for the knowledge of things they had,
        which they ascribed to themselves; nor for their mercies, which they
        imputed to second causes:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but became vain in their imaginations; the vanity or their minds was the
        spring and source of their evil conduct; which may design the wickedness
        of their hearts, and the imaginations thereof, which were evil, and that
        continually; the pride of their natures the carnality and weakness of
        their reasonings, and the whole system of their vain philosophy; and
        hence they ran into polytheism, or the worshipping of many gods:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and their foolish heart was darkened; where they thought their great
        wisdom lay: darkness is natural to the hearts and understandings of all
        men, which is increased by personal iniquity; Satan is concerned in
        improving it, and God sometimes gives up the hearts of persons to
        judicial blindness, which was the case of these men.

      </p>
      Professing themselves to be wise,.... The learned men among the Gentiles
      first called themselves "Sophi", wise men: and afterwards, to cover their
      wretched pride and vanity, "Philosophers", lovers of wisdom; but
      notwithstanding all their arrogance, their large pretensions to wisdom,
      and boast of it
      <p></p>
      <p>
        they became fools; they appeared to be so; they showed themselves to be
        such in those very things they prided themselves with the knowledge of:
        as, for instance, Socrates, after he had asserted the unity of God, and
        is said to die a martyr for the truth; yet one of the last actions of
        his life was sacrificing a cock to Aesculapius, at least he desired his
        friend Crito to do it.

        >
      </p>
      And changed the glory of the incorruptible God,.... God is incorruptible
      and immortal in his nature, and so is opposed to all corruptible creatures
      and things: he has a glory which is essential to him, and a manifestative
      one in the creatures, and which is relative, and of right belongs to him:
      his absolute essential glory cannot be changed, cannot be taken away from
      him, nor given to another; but his relative glory may be said to be
      changed, when another is worshipped in his stead, and called by his name.
      So Philo the Jew (g) speaks of
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "some, who, leaving the true God, make to themselves false ones, and
        impose the name of the eternal and incorruptible upon created and
        corruptible beings.''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        Into an image made like to corruptible man; which was worshipped in
        different forms by the several nations of the world:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and to birds; as the dove by the Samaritans, the hawk, the ibis, and
        others by the Egyptians:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>and fourfooted beasts; as the ox, and other creatures:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and creeping things; such as beetles, serpents, and others, by the same.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      </p>
      Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness,.... Not by putting any
      into them, but by leaving them to the pollution of their nature; by
      withdrawing his providential restraints from them, and by giving them up
      to judicial hardness:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        through the lusts of their own hearts. The heart of man is the source of
        all wickedness; the lusts that dwell there are many, and these tend to
        uncleanness of one sort or another: by it here is meant particularly
        bodily uncleanness, since it is said they were given up
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to dishonour their own bodies between themselves; either alone, or with
        others; so that as they changed the glory of God, and dishonoured him,
        he left them to dishonour themselves by doing these things which were
        reproachful and scandalous to human nature.

      Who changed the truth of God into a lie,.... Not the truth of the Gospel,
      which they were unacquainted with; but that which might be known of God as
      true, and was known of them by the light of nature; or the true God
      himself, whom they "changed into a lie"; by ascribing to false deities,
      which were lying vanities, those things which were known of God; and by
      worshipping them instead of him: for they
      <p></p>
      <p>
        worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator; or "above him"
        or "against him", in opposition to him, or "besides him", others along
        with him; or neglecting him, and not worshipping him at all; which is
        aggravated in that what they worshipped was a creature, either of their
        own, or of God's making, and whom they neglected was the Creator of
        them:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who is blessed for ever, Amen; is blessed in himself, and the fountain
        of all blessedness to his creatures; which is so glaring a truth, that
        everyone ought to say and set his "Amen" to it.

      </p>
      For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections,.... Because of their
      idolatrous practices, God left them to very dishonourable actions,
      sodomitical ones, both among the men and women:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        for even the women did change the natural use into that which is against
        nature; either by prostituting themselves to, and complying with the
        "sodomitical" embraces of men, in a way that is against nature (h); or
        by making use of such ways and methods with themselves, or other women,
        to gratify their lusts, which were never designed by nature for such an
        use: of these vicious women, and their practices, Seneca (i) speaks,
        when he says,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "libidine veto nec maribus quidem cedunt, pati natae; Dii illas Deoeque,
        male perdant; adeo perversum commentae, genus impudicitiae, viros
        ineunt:''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>also Clemens Alexandrinus (k) has respect to such, saying,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>"gunaikev andrizontai para fusin, gamou men ai te kai .'</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        and such there were among the Jews, whom they call (l), and whom the
        priests were forbidden to marry.

      </p>
      And likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the women,.... The
      very sin of "sodomy" is here designed, so called from Sodom, the place
      where we first hear of it (Gen 19:5) the men of which
      place, because they
      <p></p>
      <p>
        burned in their lust one towards another, as these Gentiles are said to
        do, God rained upon them fire and brimstone from heaven: an exceeding
        great sin this is, contrary to nature, dishonourable to human nature,
        and scandalous to a people and nation among whom it prevails, as it did
        very much in the Gentile world, and among their greatest philosophers;
        even those that were most noted for moral virtue are charged with it, as
        Socrates, Plato, Zeno, and others (m): it is a sin which generally
        prevails where idolatry and infidelity do, as among the Pagans of old,
        and among the Papists and Mahometans now; and never was it so rife in
        this nation as since the schemes of deism and infidelity have found such
        a reception among us. Thus God, because men dishonour him with their
        evil principles and practices, leaves them to reproach their own nature,
        and dishonour their own bodies:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        men with men working that which is unseemly; and of which nothing like
        it is to be observed in the brutal world:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        receiving in themselves the recompence of their error, which was meet:
        God punishes sin with sin; for as the Jews say (n), as
      </p>
      <p></p>

        another; for the reward of the commandment is the commandment, and the
        reward of transgression is transgression.''

      And even as they did not like,.... This accounts for the justness of the
      divine procedure in leaving them to commit such scandalous iniquities;
      that since they had some knowledge of God by the light of nature, and yet
      did not care
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to retain God in their knowledge; or to own and acknowledge him as God,
        to worship and glorify him as such; but took every method to erase this
        knowledge out of their minds, and keep it from others:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God gave them over to a reprobate mind; a vain empty mind, worthless,
        good for nothing devoid of all true knowledge and judgment; incapable of
        approving what is truly good, or of disapproving that which is evil; a
        mind that has lost all conscience of things, and is disapproved of by
        God, and all good men:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        to do those things which are not convenient; which are neither agreeably
        to the light of nature, nor convenient to, or becoming the honour of
        human nature; things which the brutes themselves, who are destitute of
        reason, do not do.

      Being filled with all unrighteousness,.... From hence, to the end of the
      chapter, follows a large and black list and catalogue of the sad
      characters of the Gentiles, and of the best men they had among them; for
      the apostle is all along speaking, not of the common people, but of their
      wise professors, and moral instructors; than which there never was a more
      wicked set of men that ever lived upon the face of the earth; who under
      the guise of morality were guilty of the greatest pride and covetousness,
      and of the most filthy debaucheries imaginable: they were "filled with all
      unrighteousness". This word includes in it all manner of sin and
      wickedness in general; fitly expresses the condition of fallen men,
      destitute of a righteousness; designs every violation of the law
      respecting our neighbour; and is opposed to that vain conceit of
      righteousness which these men had: particular branches of it follow; as,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        fornication; which sometimes includes adultery and an unchastity; simple
        fornication was not reckoned a sin among the Gentiles:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        wickedness; or mischief, which intends not so much the internal
        wickedness of the heart, as that particular vice, by which a man is
        inclined and studies to do hurt, to others, as Satan does:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        covetousness; this may intend every insatiable lust, and particularly
        the sin which goes by this name, and is the root of all evil, and was a
        reigning sin among the Gentiles. Seneca, the famous moralist, was
        notoriously guilty of this vice, being one of the greatest usurers that
        ever lived:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        maliciousness; the word denotes either the iniquity of nature in which
        men are conceived and born; or that desire of revenge in men, for which
        some are very notorious:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        envy; at the superior knowledge and learning, wealth and riches,
        happiness, and outward prosperity of others:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        murder: which sometimes arose from envy, wherefore they are put
        together. There is an elegant "paranomasia" in the Greek text:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        debate; strife about words more than things, and more for vain glory,
        and a desire of victory, than for truth:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        deceit; through their empty notions of philosophy; hence "philosophy and
        vain deceit" go together,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008">Col 2:8</a>; making large
        pretences to morality, when they were the vilest of creatures:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        malignity; moroseness; having no courteousness nor affability in them,
        guilty of very ill manners; as particularly they were who were of the
        sect of the Cynics. Now they are said to be "filled with", and "full
        of", these things; not filled by God, but by Satan and themselves; and
        it denotes the aboundings of wickedness in them, and which was
        insatiable. The apostle goes on to describe them, as
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        whisperers; who made mischief among friends, by privately suggesting,
        and secretly insinuating things into the mind of one to the prejudice of
        another.

      Backbiters,.... Who more publicly defamed the characters of their
      neighbours, and hurt their good name, credit and reputation, though behind
      their backs:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        haters of God; some read it, "hated of God"; as all workers of iniquity
        are; but rather this expresses their sin, that they were deniers of the
        being and providence of God, and showed themselves to be enemies to him
        by their evil works:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>despiteful; both by opprobrious words, and injurious actions:</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        proud; of their natural knowledge, learning, eloquence and vain
        philosophy:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        boasters: of their parts, abilities, wisdom and works; all which they
        attributed to themselves, and to the sharpness of their wit, their
        sagacity and industry:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        inventors of evil things; of evil schemes of morality and philosophy,
        and of evil practices, as well as principles:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        disobedient to parents; which was acting contrary to the light of
        nature.

      Without understanding,.... Of God, of his nature and worship, of things
      divine and even moral, being given up to a reprobate mind:
      <p></p>
      <p>covenant breakers; had no regard to private or public contracts:</p>

      <p>implacable; when once offended there was no reconciling of them:</p>

      <p>unmerciful; had no pity and compassion to persons in distress.</p>

      Who knowing the judgment of God,.... Either of the law of God, the law and
      light of nature, by which they might in some measure know the difference
      between good and evil, and what was right and wrong; or the judiciary
      sentence of God against sin:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that they which commit such things are worthy of death; at least of
        corporeal death:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that do them; all which
        greatly aggravated their wickedness, since they sinned against light and
        knowledge, with approbation and good liking of their own sins, and took
        pleasure in the sins of others. The Jews have a saying (p),
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "that no man is suspected of a thing but he has done it; and if he has
        not done the whole of it, he has done part of it, and if he has not done
        part of it, he has thought in his heart to do it, and if he has not
        thought in his heart to do it, , "he has seen others do it, and has
        rejoiced".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And if such a man is a wicked man, how much more wicked are such who
        commit sin themselves, and delight in the sins of others? now from this
        whole account we see the insufficiency of the light of nature to guide
        persons in the way of salvation; what need there was of a divine
        revelation; and how impossible it is that such men should ever be
        justified before God, by any works of seeming righteousness done by
        them; which the apostle had in view, in giving this account of the
        depraved nature and conduct of the Gentiles, and of those among them who
        professed to be, and were the wisest and most knowing of them.
