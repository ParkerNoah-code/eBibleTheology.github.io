      <h2>Romans Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        As the former chapter shows that sanctified ones are not free from the
        being of sin in them, which is a ground of general complaint and
        uneasiness; this chapter shows, that justified ones are freed from the
        guilt of sin, and secure from punishment for it; and have the utmost
        reason to rejoice and be glad, and even to triumph in a plerophory and
        full assurance of faith, on account of the various privileges they
        enjoy, through the grace of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit;
        and which are distinctly, largely, and severally mentioned: it begins (Rom 8:1) with taking
        notice of a particular privilege saints have in Christ, and, by virtue
        of union to him, security from all condemnation; and which is inferred
        from their sure and certain deliverance from sin by Christ (Rom 8:25) the persons
        sharing in this privilege are described by their being in Christ, and by
        their walking after the Spirit of Christ, in consequence of it: a reason
        confirming this privilege is given (Rom 8:2) taken either from
        the Gospel, declaring the saints' freedom from the law; or from the
        power and efficacy of the Spirit, delivering them from the tyranny and
        dominion of sin; or rather from the holiness of Christ's human nature,
        as a branch of their justification: this privilege is made more fully to
        appear, and the saints' interest in it by the mission of Christ, to
        bring in everlasting righteousness for them, which is the foundation of
        it (Rom 8:3) the occasion
        of which was the weakness of the law, or rather the impotency of man,
        through the corruption of nature, to fulfil the law: the sender, or the
        efficient cause of this mission, is God the Father; the person sent, his
        own Son; the manner in which he was sent, in human nature, which had the
        appearance of being sinful; what God did in it, he condemned sin in it;
        which is a reason, why there is no condemnation to them, that are in
        him; and the end of all this (Rom 8:4) was, that the law
        of righteousness might be perfectly fulfilled by Christ for them, or by
        them in him; who are described in part, as in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Rom 8:1</a>, upon the
        repetition of which part of the description, the apostle proceeds to
        show the difference between unregenerate and regenerate persons (Rom 8:5) partly by their
        characters; the one being carnal, or after the flesh, the other being
        spiritual, or after the Spirit; and by their different affections, the
        one minding the things of the flesh, the other the things of the Spirit;
        the different issue and effect of which, namely, a carnal and a
        spiritual mind are observed (Rom 8:6) death following
        upon the one, life and peace upon the other; the reasons of which, with
        respect to the former, are given (Rom 8:7) taken from the
        enmity of the carnal mind to God, and the non-subjection of it to the
        law of God, and the impossibility of its being subject to it; and
        therefore nothing but death can be expected; from whence this conclusion
        is made (Rom 8:8) that
        unregenerate men are not in a state, nor in a capacity to please God, or
        do what is acceptable to him, the above being the disposition and temper
        of their minds: and then in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#009">Rom 8:9</a>, the apostle
        returns to the argument from whence be had digressed, and suggests, that
        though he had said the above things of unregenerate men, he had other
        thoughts of those to whom he writes; they were not in the flesh, nor
        minded the things of the flesh, and so were not liable to condemnation
        and death; and which he proves by the inhabitation of the Spirit of God
        in them; for such who have him not, have no proof nor evidence of their
        being Christ's, and so consequently have no proof of their security from
        condemnation; and partly by Christ's being in them, and which is the
        evidence of their being in Christ, and so of the above privilege (Rom 8:10) the consequence
        of which is, that though by reason of sin the body is mortal, and does
        die, yet the soul lives not only naturally, but spiritually, by faith in
        Christ now, and in glory hereafter, by virtue of Christ's righteousness
        imputed to it, and so is free from condemnation and death; besides, by
        virtue of the Spirit's dwelling in them, their mortal bodies will be
        quickened in the general resurrection (Rom 8:11) and from all
        these blessings of divine goodness, both in soul and body, the apostle
        infers, that the saints are under obligation, not to live in a carnal,
        but in a spiritual manner (Rom 8:12) and to which he
        exhorts (Rom 8:13) and
        presses by motives, taken from the different consequences of those
        things; death following by living after the flesh, and life through the
        mortification of sin, by the Spirit of God: and whereas the walking
        after the Spirit, by which he had described those that are safe from
        condemnation, is owing to their being led by him; and their being led by
        him, being an evidence of their divine sonship (Rom 8:14) from hence he
        passes to consider the privilege of adoption: and that these saints were
        interested in this privilege, he proves
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Rom 8:15</a>, partly by their
        not having the spirit of bondage which belongs to servants; and partly
        by their having the spirit of adoption, who had made known this grace
        unto them, and their interest in it: and that they had received him as a
        spirit of adoption, was evident by their calling God their Father under
        his influence; and also by the witness he bore to their spirits, that
        they were the children of God (Rom 8:16) of which they
        were conscious: and from this privilege of adoption, the apostle
        concludes heirship (Rom 8:17) and which is of
        such a nature, that there is none like it; both with respect to the
        subject of it, God himself; with respect to him with whom they are
        heirs, Christ Jesus; and the way in which they come to share the
        glorious inheritance with him, is through suffering with him, and for
        him; and this they need not grudge to do, since there is no comparison
        between their sufferings, and the glory they shall enjoy (Rom 8:18) which both Jews
        and Gentiles were in the expectation of; the latter of which are
        described in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#019">Rom 8:19</a>, by
        their name, the creature, the whole creation; and by their present
        condition, the Gospel being come among them to the conversion of many,
        which raised an expectation of many sons and daughters being born to God
        among them (Rom 8:19) and
        by their former state and condition (Rom 8:20) which is
        mentioned, to illustrate the grace of God in the present blessing
        bestowed upon them, in sending the Gospel to them; which state was a
        subjection to vanity, through the god of this world, who led them
        captive at his will (Rom 8:21) and then by the
        deliverance of them, they were in hope and expectation of, from bondage
        to liberty (Rom 8:21) and
        this groaning and travailing: in birth in a spiritual sense, for the
        bringing forth of many sons to God among the Gentiles, the apostle, and
        other ministers of the word, who had preached the Gospel among them,
        were witnesses of (Rom 8:22) yea, not only
        the Gentiles, but the Jews also, who are described as having the first
        fruits of the Spirit (Rom 8:23) were waiting for
        the manifestation of the children of God among the Gentiles, with them
        to complete at last the mystical body, who shall share together the
        glory before spoken of, which their sonship and heirship entitle them
        to; and for which there is encouragement to wait with patience and in
        hope, from the connection of salvation with the grace of hope; and from,
        the nature of the thing hoped for, which is unseen, but certain,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024">Rom 8:24</a>. From hence the
        apostle proceeds to consider another privilege which the saints have,
        who are in the Spirit, and walk after the Spirit, the Spirit helps their
        infirmities; particularly in prayer, the matter of which, in some cases,
        they are at a loss about (Rom 8:26) and this he
        does, by making intercession for them; the manner in which this is done
        in them, is with unutterable groans; and the rule according to which it
        is made, is the will of God, the mind of the Spirit being known by the
        searcher of hearts (Rom 8:27) in a word, such
        are the privileges of believers in Christ, that every thing in the whole
        world, in heaven, and in earth, in themselves and others, whether good
        or bad, prosperous or adverse, work together for their good, so that
        nothing can go wrong with them in the issue (Rom 8:28) who are
        described by their love to God, and by their effectual calling,
        according to his purpose; which being mentioned, leads the apostle to
        the source and spring of all these and other privileges, the everlasting
        love of God; signified by his foreknowledge of his people (Rom 8:29) which is the
        cause of their predestination to a conformity to the image of Christ,
        the firstborn among many brethren; with which predestination, calling,
        justification, and glorification, are inseparably connected (Rom 8:30) from all which
        blessings of grace it may be concluded, that God is on the side of such
        persons, who are interested in these favours; and nothing is to be
        feared, but every good thing is to be expected by them (Rom 8:31) which is
        confirmed by an argument from the greater to the lesser, that if God has
        given his Son for them, he will freely give all things to them (Rom 8:32) in a view of
        which, the apostle rises up in a triumph of faith, and challenges all
        the enemies of the saints, and denies that any charge can be brought
        against them of any avail, since God is the justifier of them (Rom 8:33) or that they
        shall ever enter into condemnation, being secured from it by the death
        of Christ; and which security is yet more strengthened by his
        resurrection, session at the right hand of God, and intercession for
        them (Rom 8:34) and then
        asks, since Christ has shown such love to them, by these instances of
        it, what can separate from it (Rom 8:35) and enumerates
        several things which befall the saints in this life, which, however mean
        and abject they may render them in the esteem of men, do not at all
        abate the love of Christ to them: that such is their case, that they are
        exposed to afflictions and sufferings, and even death itself, for the
        sake of Christ, is proved
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036">Rom 8:36</a>, by a testimony
        out of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022">Psa 44:22</a>, and then
        an answer is returned to the above question in the negative, that none
        of the things mentioned could separate them from the love of Christ; so
        far from it, that by virtue of Christ who had loved them, they were
        conquerors, and more than conquerors in all these things, and over all
        their enemies (Rom 8:37)
        and the chapter is concluded in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#038">Rom 8:38</a>, with the full
        and firm persuasion of the apostle, that nothing in the whole universe,
        in the whole compass of created beings, be they what they will, good or
        bad, or which are or shall be, an enumeration of many of which is made,
        should ever separate him, or any of the people of God from his love,
        which is in Christ Jesus: so that upon the whole, notwithstanding
        indwelling sin, notwithstanding the various afflictions which attend
        them in this world, yet in consideration of the many privileges they
        enjoy, and the glory they are heirs of, they have great reason to
        rejoice, and look upon themselves to be in the most safe and happy
        condition.

      There is therefore now, no condemnation,.... The apostle having discoursed
      largely in the preceding chapter, concerning the struggle and combat
      believers feel within themselves, and opened the true causes and reasons
      of the saints' grievances and complaints, and what gives them the greatest
      uneasiness in this life, proceeds in this to take notice of the solid
      ground and foundation they have of spiritual peace and joy; which arise
      from their justification and adoption, the purposes and decrees of God,
      and particularly the everlasting and unchangeable love of God in Christ,
      the source, spring, and security, of all the blessings of grace. The
      chapter begins with a most comfortable account of the safety of believers
      in Christ; the apostle does not say there is nothing condemnable in them,
      for sin is in them and is condemnable, and condemned by them; and is
      hurtful to their spiritual joy and comfort, though it cannot bring them
      into condemnation, because of their being in Christ Jesus: he says there
      is , "not one condemnation" to them, or one sentence of condemnation
      against them; which must be understood not of illegal ones, for they are
      liable to many condemnations from their hearts, from the world and the
      devil; but of legal, justifiable ones, and there are none such, neither
      from God the Father, for he justifies; nor from the Son, for by his
      righteousness they are justified; nor from the Holy Spirit, who bears
      witness to their spirits, that they are in a state of justification: there
      is not one condemnation lies against them, with respect to their numerous
      sins, original and actual, though every sin deserves one; not one from the
      law of God, of which sin is a transgression, for though that is a
      condemning law, yet it is only so to them that are under it; not to them
      that are Christ's, whom he has redeemed from it: moreover, the apostle
      says, that there is no condemnation now to the saints; which "now" must
      not be considered, as if it supposes that there was formerly condemnation
      to them; it is true indeed they were under a sentence of condemnation, as
      considered in Adam, and under a covenant of works with him, and in their
      own apprehensions when convicted; but as considered in Christ, as the
      elect of God always were, and who was their surety, and so their security
      from all eternity, they never were in a state of condemnation: nor does
      this suppose, that there may be condemnation to them hereafter, though not
      now; for sin, the cause of condemnation, is removed; Christ has bore the
      condemnation their sins deserved in himself; their justification is from
      all sin, past, present, and to come; their union to Christ is
      indissoluble, and neither the love of Christ, nor the justice of God, will
      admit of their condemnation; for this "now", is not an "adverb" of time,
      but a "note of illation"; the apostle inferring this privilege, either
      from the grace of God, which issues in eternal life,
      <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023">Rom 6:23</a>; or from that
      certain deliverance believers shall have from sin, for which he gives
      thanks, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#024">Rom 7:24</a>; The
      privilege itself here mentioned is, "no condemnation": condemnation is
      sometimes put for the cause of it, which is sin, original and actual; now
      though God's elect are sinners, both by nature and practice, and after
      conversion have sin in them, their sanctification being imperfect, yet
      there is none in them with respect to justification; all is transferred to
      Christ, and he has removed all away; he has procured the pardon of all by
      his blood, he has abolished all by his sacrifice, he justifies from all by
      his righteousness, and saves his people from all their sins: condemnation
      may also be considered with respect to guilt; all mankind are guilty of
      Adam's sin, and are guilty creatures, as they are actual transgressors of
      the law; and when convinced by the Spirit of God, acknowledge themselves
      to be so; and upon the repetition of sin, contract fresh guilt on their
      consciences; but an heart sprinkled with the blood of Christ, is clear of
      guilt; for all the guilt of sin is removed to Christ, and he has took it
      away; hence there is no obligation to punishment on them, for whom Christ
      died: again, condemnation may design the sentence of it: now though the
      law's sentence passed upon all in Adam, and so upon God's elect, as
      considered in him; yet as this sentence has been executed on Christ, as
      their surety, in their room and stead, there is none lies against them:
      once more, condemnation may mean actual damnation, or eternal death, the
      wages of sin, which those who are in Christ shall never die; they are
      ordained to eternal life, and are redeemed from this death; they are made
      alive by Christ, and have eternal life secured to them in him, and which
      they shall certainly enjoy: the persons interested in this privilege are
      described, as such
      <p></p>
      <p>
        which are in Christ Jesus; not as mere professors are in Christ, who may
        be lost and damned: but this being in Christ, respects either that union
        and interest which the elect of God have in Christ, from everlasting:
        being loved by him with an everlasting love; betrothed to him in a
        conjugal relation; chosen in him before the foundation of the world;
        united to him as members to an head; considered in him in the covenant
        of grace, when he engaged for them as their surety; and so they were
        preserved in him, notwithstanding their fall in Adam; in time he took
        upon him their nature, and represented them in it; they were reckoned in
        him when he hung upon the cross, was buried, rose again, and sat down in
        heavenly places; in consequence of which union to Christ, and being in
        him, they are secure from all condemnation: or this may respect an open
        and manifestative being in Christ at conversion, when they become new
        creatures, pass from death to life, and so shall never enter into
        condemnation: hence they stand further described, as such
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        who walk not after the flesh; by which is meant, not the ceremonial law,
        but the corruption of nature, or the corrupt nature of man, called
        "flesh"; because propagated by carnal generation, has for its object
        fleshly things, discovers itself mostly in the flesh, and makes persons
        carnal and fleshly; the apostle does not say, there is no condemnation
        to them that have no flesh in them, for this regenerate persons have;
        nor to them that are in the flesh, that is, the body; but who walk not
        after the flesh, that is, corrupt nature; and it denotes such, who do
        not follow the dictates of it, do not make it their guide, or go on and
        persist in a continued series of sinning:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but after the spirit, by which is meant, not spiritual worship, in
        opposition to carnal ordinances; but rather, either a principle of
        grace, in opposition to corrupt nature, called "Spirit", from the
        author, subject, and nature of it; or the Holy Spirit of God, the
        efficient cause of all grace: to walk after him, is to make him our
        guide, to follow his dictates, influences, and directions; as such do,
        who walk by faith on Christ, and in imitation of him, in the ways of
        righteousness and holiness; and such persons walk pleasantly,
        cheerfully, and safely: now let it be observed, that this walk and
        conversation of the saints, is not the cause of there being no
        condemnation to them; but is descriptive of the persons interested in
        such a privilege; and is evidential of their right unto it, as well as
        of their being in Christ: and it may be further observed, that there
        must be union to Christ, or a being in him, before there can be walking
        after the Spirit. The phrase, "but after the Spirit", is left out in the
        Alexandrian copy, and in the Vulgate Latin, and Syriac versions; and the
        whole description of the persons in some copies, and in the Ethiopic
        version.

      For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,.... These words are of
      difficult interpretation. They may be understood of the Gospel revealing
      and declaring deliverance from the law of Moses; wherefore there can be
      "no condemnation" (Rom 8:1)
      by it. The Gospel may be designed by "the law of the Spirit of life in
      Christ Jesus"; which may be called a law, not as succeeding the law of
      works, by which that is abrogated; nor as requiring conditions to be
      performed, or as enjoining duties to be observed, or as delivering out
      threatenings in case of disobedience; but as it is a doctrine, order, and
      chain of truths, as the Hebrew word signifies, and which is sometimes used
      for the Gospel, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003">Isa 2:3</a> as
      is, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027">Rom 3:27</a>. It may be
      called the law, or doctrine "of the Spirit", because the Spirit is the
      author of it, and makes it powerful and effectual to the good of souls; by
      it the Spirit of God is conveyed into the heart; and the substance of it
      are spiritual things: and the "law of the Spirit of life", because it
      discovers the way of life and salvation by Christ; is the means of
      quickening dead sinners; of working faith in them, by which they live on
      Christ, and of reviving drooping saints; and also it affords spiritual
      food, for the support of life: and this may be said to be "in Christ", or
      by him, inasmuch as it comes from, and is concerning him; he is the sum,
      the substance, and subject matter of it:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the law of sin and death may intend the law of Moses, called "the law of
        sin"; not as if it was sinful, or commanded or encouraged sin, for it
        severely prohibits it; but because by it, through the corruption of
        man's nature, sin is irritated, and made to abound; it is the strength
        of sin, and by it is the knowledge of it: and it may be called "the law
        of death", because it threatened with death, in case of disobedience; it
        sentences and adjudges transgressors to death; and when it is attended
        with power, it strikes dead all a man's hopes of life, by obedience to
        it; it leaves persons dead as it finds them, and gives no life, nor
        hopes of it; by it none can live, or be justified: now, though Christ is
        the author of deliverance from it, yet the Gospel is the means of
        revealing and declaring this deliverance; which designs not an exemption
        from obedience to it, but freedom from the curse and condemnation of it;
        and this sense well agrees with
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001">Rom 8:1</a>; likewise the
        words are capable of being understood of the power and efficacy of the
        Spirit of God, in delivering regenerate persons from the dominion and
        tyranny of sin; and which may be considered as a reason why they "walk
        not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom 8:1) "life" may well
        be ascribed to the Spirit of God, or be called the Spirit of life,
        because he has life in himself as the Father and Son have; and is the
        author of life to others, of natural life to all men as creatures, and
        of spiritual life to the people of God in regeneration; and is a
        quickening spirit to them afterwards, as he will be to the dead bodies
        of the saints in the resurrection: by "the law" of the Spirit may be
        meant, the energy and power of the Spirit in conversion; which work
        requires power, and a man has no power of himself to effect it; but
        there is a power in the Spirit, which works irresistibly, though not by
        any force or compulsion to the will, but it moves upon it sweetly,
        powerfully, and effectually: and all this may be said to be "in Christ":
        the life which the Spirit is the author and giver of, is in Christ as
        the head of his people, the proper repository of all grace, and the
        fountain of life; the Spirit himself is in him, both as God and as man,
        and as Mediator, hence the saints receive him and his gifts and graces
        from him; and the law of the Spirit, or his power and efficacy in
        working, is "in" or "by" Christ, through his sufferings and death, and
        in consequence of his mediation: now this powerful and quickening
        efficacy of the Spirit delivers regenerate persons from the force and
        tyranny of sin, called here "the law of sin and death"; a "law of sin",
        because it has power and dominion over unregenerate persons, its throne
        is in the heart of man, and its laws are many and powerful; and "the law
        of death", because its reign is tyrannical, barbarous and cruel, it is
        unto death: and from its governing influence, and tyrannical power, does
        the Spirit of God free his people in regeneration; not from the being of
        sin; nor from the rage of it, and disturbance it gives; nor from such
        power of it, but that they may fall into sin; but so as that sin does
        not properly reign over them, nor legally, nor universally, or so as to
        bring a death on their graces, and their persons into condemnation. Once
        more, those words may be understood of the holiness of Christ's human
        nature, as a branch of our justification, and freedom from the guilt of
        sin, and condemnation by it: for as "the law of sin and death" may
        design inherent corruption, and the force and power of it in the saints;
        so the opposite to it, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ", may
        mean the purity and holiness of his human nature. That Christ's human
        nature is pure and holy is certain, from express texts of Scripture,
        from its union to the Son of God, from the ends and purposes of its
        assumption, from the inefficacy of Satan's temptations, and from the
        whole course of his life and conversation; for though he was in the
        likeness of sinful flesh, was reckoned a sinner by men, was attended
        with infirmities, the effects of sin, though not sinful, had all the
        sins of his people imputed to him, and endured afflictions, and at last
        death; yet his nature was pure and untainted: for he did not descend
        from Adam by ordinary generation; and though made of a woman, yet the
        flesh he took of her was sanctified by the Holy Ghost; his body was
        prepared by God, and curiously wrought by the Spirit, from whom his
        whole human nature received a fulness of habitual holiness: and this may
        be called "the Spirit of life" in him, because he is a quickening Spirit
        in regeneration, justification, and the resurrection from the dead; "the
        law" of it, because the holiness of his nature lies in, arises from, and
        is conformable to a law that is within him, written on his heart; and
        because, together with his obedience and death, it has a force, power,
        and authority, to free from condemnation; for this is not a mere
        necessary qualification of him to be the Mediator, or what renders his
        obedience, sacrifice, and intercession, efficacious and valuable, or is
        merely exemplary to us, but is what is imputed to us, as a part of our
        justification. The law requires a holy nature of us, we have not one,
        Christ assumed one for us, and so is the end of the law, or answers the
        requirement of the law in this respect, as well as in all others: and
        hence, though sanctification begun in us, does not free us from the
        being of sin, and all its force and power, yet perfect sanctification in
        Christ frees from all condemnation by it.

      For what the law could not do,.... This is not to be understood of "the
      law of the mind", in opposition to "the law of sin", which indeed is very
      feeble and impotent; man had a power originally of obeying the divine
      commands, but through sin he has lost his strength and power; and even a
      renewed mind cannot perform what it would, which is owing to the flesh, or
      corrupt nature; it has strong desires after holiness, and keeping all the
      commandments of God; but these desires cannot be fulfilled by it, and
      indeed without Christ it can do no good thing: nor is the ceremonial law
      intended, though this is weak, and there are many things it could not do;
      it could not expiate and atone for sin; nor remove the guilt of it, nor
      cleanse from the filth of it: But the moral law is here designed; this,
      though it can, and does accuse of sin, can convince of it, can curse,
      condemn, and condemn to death for it; yet it could not condemn sin itself,
      which is only abolished by Christ; it cannot restrain from sin, nor change
      a sinful nature, nor sanctify an impure heart; nor free from the guilt of
      sin, nor comfort a distressed mind under a sense of it, it cannot subject
      persons, or bring them to before God, or give life, or save from death;
      the reason is,
      <p></p>
      <p>in that, or because</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        it was weak through the flesh. The weakness of the law is total and
        universal, it has no strength at all; though not original and natural,
        but accidental; it is owing to the flesh, or the corrupt nature of man:
        or rather the weakness is in sinful men, and not in the law; and the
        sense is this, that human nature is so weakened by sin, that it is
        incapable of fulfilling the law; the weakness of the law is not from
        itself, but from man: to this agrees what the Jewish writers (u) say,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "there is not a word in the law "weak", or broken; wherefore when thou
        considerest and observest it, that thou dost not find it strong, as an
        hammer that breaks the rocks, , "but if weak, it is of thyself".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        To which may be added that usual saying of theirs, , "there is no
        strength but the law" (w); unless the apostle can be thought to oppose
        this notion of theirs. Wherefore because of the weakness of the law, or
        of human nature to fulfil it,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
        condemned sin in the flesh. The person sending is God, who gave the law
        weakened by the flesh, against whom we have sinned: and who is
        righteous, pure, and holy: which considerations enhance his grace and
        goodness, in the mission of Christ. This must be understood of God the
        Father, who is here manifestly distinguished from the Son; and who is
        God, but not solely, or to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit; and who
        sent Christ, though not singly, for the "Lord God and his Spirit sent"
        him,
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016">Isa 48:16</a>; though as it is
        most agreeable for a father to send his son, this is generally ascribed
        to him; and he being the first person in the Godhead, is the first in
        order of working, and so in redemption. The person sent is his own Son;
        not by creation, as angels and men are; nor by adoption, as saints are;
        nor is he called so, on account of his incarnation, resurrection, or
        mediatorship, for he was the Son of God antecedent to either of them;
        but his own proper Son, and not in any metaphorical sense; a Son of the
        same nature with him, begotten of him, and his Son in that nature in
        which he is God. The act of sending, does not suppose inequality of
        nature; for though he that is sent is not greater, yet as great as he
        that sends; two equals, by agreement, may send each other; a divine
        person may assume an office, and under that consideration be sent,
        without supposing inferiority of nature, as in the case of the Holy
        Spirit; and an inferiority as to office, is allowed in the case of the
        Son; God sent his Son under the character of a servant, to do work: nor
        does this act imply change of place; there is indeed a "terminus a quo",
        from whence he was sent, from heaven, from his Father there; and there
        is a "terminus ad quem", to which he was sent into this world; but then
        this coming of his from heaven to earth, was not by local motion, but by
        assumption of nature; nor was it out of any disrespect to his Son, but
        out of love to us, that he sent him; nor was he sent against his will;
        he showed no reluctance at the proposal to him in the council of peace,
        but the utmost willingness; nor any at his coming into the world: nor at
        the work itself, which he entered upon, and went through with the
        greatest eagerness and cheerfulness: nor does it suppose him whilst
        sent, and here on earth, to be in a state of absence and separation from
        his Father; he was still in his bosom, yet in heaven, and his Father
        always with him: but it supposes that he existed before he was sent;
        that he was a person, and distinct from the Father, or he could not be
        sent by him; that he had authority from him, considered in his office
        capacity: in a word, this sending of the Son, designs the manifestation
        of him in human nature; as appears from the form and manner in which he
        was sent, "in the likeness of sinful flesh"; which expresses the reality
        of his incarnation, of his having a true real human nature; for flesh is
        not to be taken strictly for a part of the body, nor for the whole body
        only, but for the whole human nature, soul and body; which though it
        looked like a sinful nature, yet was not sinful: the likeness of it
        denotes the outward appearance of Christ in it; who was born of a sinful
        woman; was subject to the infirmities of human nature, which though not
        sinful, are the effects of sin; was reckoned among transgressors, was
        traduced as one himself by men, and treated as such by the justice of
        God; he having all the sins of his people on him, for which he was
        answerable: "and" hence God, "for sin, condemned sin in the flesh"; not
        the law, which was weak through the flesh; nor sinners, who broke the
        law; but sin itself, the transgression of the law, all kind of sin, and
        all that is in it the act of condemning it, does not design God's
        disapproving of it, and judging it to be evil; this he could not but do,
        as being contrary to his nature, an act of hostility against him, a
        breach of his law, and what brings ruin upon his creatures; and this he
        would have done, if Christ had never suffered in the flesh; and he has
        taken other methods, both among his own people and the world, to show
        his dislike of sin: nor does this act intend the destruction of the
        power and dominion of sin, in regeneration; this is the work of the
        Spirit, and is done in our flesh, and not in the flesh of Christ; but it
        is to be understood of the condemnation and punishment of sin, in the
        person of Christ: sin was laid on him by the Father, and he voluntarily
        took it upon himself; justice finding it there, charges him with it,
        demands satisfaction, and condemns him for it; and hereby sin was
        expiated, the pardon of it procured, and it was, entirely done away: now
        this is said to be done "for sin"; some join the phrase with the former
        part of the text, either with the word "sending", and take the sense to
        be, that God sent his Son for, or on the account of sin, to take it
        away, and save his people from it; or "with sinful flesh", which was
        taken from a sinful person; but it stands best as it does in our
        version, and may be rendered "of sin"; for God condemned sin of sin in
        Christ, that is, by the vengeance he took of it, in the strictness of
        his justice, through the sufferings of his Son, he showed sin to be
        exceeding sinful indeed; or rather "by sin"; that is, by an offering for
        sin, so the word is used in
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#006">Heb 10:6</a>; and answers to
        in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006">Psa 40:6</a>, by being made
        which, sin was condemned "in the flesh" of Christ, who was put to death
        in the flesh, "for" the sins of his people, and bore all the punishment
        due unto them: from hence we learn the evil of sin, the strictness of
        justice, and the grace of the Redeemer.

      That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,.... By the
      righteousness of the law, is not meant the righteousness of the ceremonial
      law, though that was fulfilled by Christ; but of the moral law, which
      requires holiness of nature, righteousness of life, and death in case of
      disobedience; active righteousness, or obedience to the precepts of the
      law, is designed here. This is what the law requires; obedience to the
      commands of it is properly righteousness; and by Christ's obedience to it
      we are made righteous, and this gives the title to eternal life: now this
      is said to be "fulfilled in us"; this is not fulfilled by us in our own
      persons, nor can it be; could it, where would be the weakness of the law?
      man might then be justified by it, and so the grace of God, and the
      righteousness of Christ, must be set aside: there never was any mere man
      that could fulfil it; for obedience to it must not only be performed
      perfectly, but with intenseness of mind and spirit; a man must be sinless
      in thought, word, and deed; and this would be to put man upon a level with
      Adam in a state of innocence, and the angels in heaven: nor is this to be
      understood of any righteousness inherent in man; internal holiness is
      never called the righteousness of the law; and could it be thought to be
      righteousness, yet it can never be reckoned the whole righteousness of the
      law: and though it is a fruit of Christ's death, it is the work of the
      Spirit, and is neither the whole, nor any part of our justification: but
      this is to be understood of the righteousness of the law fulfilled by
      Christ, and imputed to us; Christ has fulfilled the whole righteousness of
      the law, all the requirements of it; this he has done in the room and
      stead of his people; and is imputed to them, by virtue of a federal union
      between him and them, he being the head, and they his members; and the law
      being fulfilled by him, it is reckoned all one as it was fulfilled in, or
      if by them; and hence they are personally, perfectly, and legally
      justified; and this is the end of Christ's being sent, of sin being laid
      on him, and condemned in him. The descriptive character of the persons,
      who appear to be interested in this blessing, is the same with that in

      For they that are after the flesh,.... By flesh is meant the corruption of
      nature; and they may be said to be "after" it, not all that have flesh in
      them, for the best of saints have it in them; regenerating grace does not
      remove it from them; there is a difference between being in and after the
      flesh, and flesh being in us; but such who are as they were born, who have
      nothing but flesh, or corrupt nature in them, in whom that is the
      governing principle, whose minds are carnal, and whose whole walk and
      conversation is, such, are here meant: and these persons
      <p></p>
      <p>
        do mind the things of the flesh: not merely things corporeal, belonging
        to the welfare of the body; or things natural for the improvement of the
        mind; or things civil, as riches, &amp;c. which may be minded and sought
        after in a lawful way; but things sinful, the lusts, works, and sins of
        the flesh: which they may be said to "mind", since they judge them to be
        good; the bent and application of their minds are to them; their
        affections are set upon them; they are solicitously careful to provide
        for them, and savour and relish them: nor is it to be wondered at, since
        these are natural to them; they are opposite to God and so agreeable to
        them; they have no mind, thought, affection, or relish, for anything
        else; and it is entirely owing to mighty grace, that any mind the things
        of the Spirit:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but they that are after the Spirit; not such who follow the dictates of
        their own spirits; or are outwardly reformed; nor all that have
        spiritual gifts; or profess themselves to have the grace and Spirit of
        God; but such who are born again, are renewed in the spirit of their
        minds, in whom grace is the governing principle: the work of the Spirit
        is begun in them, though not perfected: the Spirit himself dwells in
        them, and they walk after him; their minds and conversations are
        spiritual, though there may be a great deal of carnality in their
        hearts, thoughts, words, and actions, which is matter of grief unto
        them: these mind
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the things of the Spirit; the graces of the Spirit; spiritual blessings;
        the doctrines of the Gospel; spiritual sacrifices and services: these
        have some understanding of, can discern the difference between them and
        carnal things, judge and approve of them as right; have a great esteem
        and affection for them, and taste a sweetness in them. They have no mind
        naturally to these things; nor is the bias of their minds altered by
        themselves, nor could it; this is wholly the work of the Spirit of God;
        and these things are minded only because, and as they are agreeable to
        the spiritual part, the inward man.

      For to be carnally minded is death,.... The phrase the apostle here uses,
      includes the best part of corrupt man; the mind, the understanding, the
      judgment, the will, the affections, the thoughts, the reason, and
      reasonings of man; and may be rendered, "the wisdom", or "prudence of the
      flesh"; so called, to distinguish it from that wisdom which is from above;
      from that natural and civil wisdom, which is laudable; and it shows that
      the wisest part of man is but carnal: all sorts of persons destitute of
      the grace of God are concerned herein; or this is applicable to them all,
      as the sensualist, the worldling, the proud Pharisee, and the wise
      disputer of this world. This wisdom of the flesh, or carnal mindedness,
      "is death"; not that it is conversant about death; or that such persons
      are thoughtful of it, endeavour to make it familiar to them; or are
      desirous of it, and esteem it as a privilege; this only spiritually minded
      men do: but the sense is, that this issues in death; death is not the
      object, but the end of carnal mindedness; carnal mindedness, so far as it
      prevails in the saints, brings a death upon them. It is true, indeed, they
      cannot die a spiritual, or an eternal death; yet sometimes they are very
      dead and lifeless in their frames, in the exercise of grace and discharge
      of duty; which is frequently owing to their carnality: and the effect of
      this must needs be death in carnal men; since it alienates from God; it
      renders them transgressors of the law, and obnoxious to its curse; it sets
      the soul against, and diverts it from Christ the way of life; and if grace
      prevent not, must be the cause of, and issue in eternal death; because it
      is sin and sinful, it is enmity to God, it disqualifies for life, and
      makes persons fit companions for the heirs of wrath:
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but to be spiritually minded, is life and peace; spiritually minded men
        are the only living persons in a spiritual sense, for all that are in
        and after the flesh are dead; and so far as carnal mindedness prevails
        in professors, there is a deadness in them as to all spiritual
        exercises; and oftentimes as to outward appearance, there is no
        difference between them and dead men: but spiritually minded men are
        evidently living persons; they have a spiritual discerning of spiritual
        things; they breathe after them, savour and relish them; they talk of
        spiritual things, and walk in a spiritual manner; they are not only
        alive, but lively in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; and
        are the means of enlivening others; and their end will be everlasting
        life; which is certain from the declared will and promise of God, and
        from the grace of life and Spirit of life which are in them. "Peace"
        also is another effect of spiritual mindedness; such enjoy peace of
        conscience: this is a fruit of the Spirit; a part of the kingdom of
        grace the are possessed of; and the things their minds are conversant
        with are productive of it; which is the gift of God, passes all
        understanding, and is of more worth than all the world: such men are
        also of peaceable dispositions in commonwealths, in neighbourhoods, in
        families, and churches; induced thereunto by the noblest arguments; and
        their end will be peace, which will be perfect and eternal.

      Because the carnal mind is enmity against God,.... These words contain a
      reason why the issue of carnal mindedness is death; because the carnal
      mind, the wisdom of the flesh, is not only an enemy, but enmity itself
      against God: against his being; it reasons against it; it wishes he was
      not; it forms unworthy notions of him; thinks him such an one as itself;
      and endeavours to bury him in forgetfulness, and erase out of its mind all
      memorials of him: it is at enmity against his perfections; either denying
      his omniscience; or arraigning his justice and faithfulness; or despising
      his goodness, and abusing his grace and mercy: it finds fault with, and
      abhors his decrees and purposes; quarrels with his providences; it is
      implacable against his word and Gospel; especially the particular
      doctrines of grace, the Father's grace in election, the Son's in
      redemption, and the Spirit's in regeneration; and has in the utmost
      contempt the ordinances and people of Christ. This enmity is universal, it
      is in all men in unregeneracy, either direct or indirect, hidden or more
      open; it is undeserved; it is natural and deeply rooted in the mind, and
      irreconcilable without the power and grace of God. It shows itself in an
      estrangedness from God; in holding friendship with the world, in
      harbouring the professed enemies of God, in living under the government of
      sin and Satan; in hating what God loves, and in loving what God hates; in
      omitting what God commands, and committing what he forbids; it manifests
      itself in their language, and throughout the whole of their conversations.
      <p></p>
      <p>
        For it is not subject to the law of God; carnal men are subject to the
        law's sentence of condemnation, but not to its precepts, by obedience to
        them; there may be an external, and which is a servile obedience to it,
        but not a free, voluntary, internal one, and still less a perfect one:
        the carnal mind is so far from an obedient subjection to the law, that
        it is far off from the law, and the law from that; it hates and despises
        it, thwarts and contradicts it in every instance, and, as much as in it
        lies, makes it void; which fully proves the enmity of the carnal mind
        against God; for hereby his being is tacitly denied, his sovereignty
        disputed, his image defaced, his government withdrawn from, and these
        persons are declared, and declare themselves enemies to him:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        neither indeed can be; without regenerating grace, without the power and
        Spirit of God, unless it is written upon the heart by the finger of God;
        for carnal men are dead in sin, and so without strength to obey the law;
        and besides, the carnal mind, and the law of God, are directly contrary
        one to another. Where is man's power and free will? no wonder the carnal
        mind do not stoop to the Gospel of Christ, when it is not, and cannot be
        subject to the law of God. Hence we see the necessity of almighty power,
        and efficacious grace in conversion. It is Christ's work to subject men
        to the law, and which is done when he justifies by his righteousness:
        agreeably to which the Targum on
        <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011">Isa 53:11</a>; paraphrases it
        thus:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        "in his wisdom he shall justify the righteous, that , "he may subject
        many to the law".''
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        And in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#011">Isa 53:11</a>, the
        transgressors he hath subjected to the law.

      So then they that are in the flesh,.... They that are in the flesh are the
      same who are said to be after it (Rom 8:5) and are there
      described. Such
      <p></p>
      <p>
        cannot please God; men, whilst unregenerate, and as such, cannot please
        God; for though the persons of God's elect are wellpleasing to him
        always, as considered in Christ, in whom they are loved with an
        everlasting love, and were chosen in him, and all provisions grace and
        glory made for them in him; yet as considered in themselves, and whilst
        in the flesh, do not please him; for they are straying from him, are
        alienated from his life, are destitute of all grace, and particularly
        faith, without which it is impossible to please him; are filthy and
        unclean, and hence, whilst such have no enjoyment of him, or communion
        with him; wherefore he sends his Spirit to work in them that which is
        wellpleasing in his sight: but this is not to be understood so much of
        persons, and their non-acceptableness to God, as of the inability of
        unregenerate men to obtain the good will of God, or make their peace
        with him; which they have no inclination to, being enmity against him;
        and were they inclined to it, know not how to go about it; nor can they
        draw nigh to God to treat with him about terms of peace; nor can they do
        that which can procure peace; Christ is the only person that can, make
        peace, and has done it: or rather, of the impotency of natural men to do
        anything which pleasing in the sight of God. There are many things which
        are pleasing to him, such as prayer, praise, giving of alms, keeping his
        commandments, and walking in his ways; but these unregenerate men cannot
        do in any acceptable manner to God; for they are without the Spirit,
        without Christ, without faith; and in all they do have no view to the
        glory of God: they have neither grace, nor strength, nor right
        principles, nor right ends.

      But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit,.... That is, ye are not
      carnal, but spiritual men; or ye are not in a state of unregeneracy, but
      in a state of grace: the reason proving this is,
      <p></p>
      <p>if so be, or "seeing"</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        that the Spirit of God dwell in you; the inhabitation of the Spirit is a
        distinguishing character of a regenerate man; which is to be understood
        not of his omnipresence, nor of a participation of his gifts, whether
        ordinary or extraordinary: nor does the Spirit of God only dwell in his
        people by his graces, but in person as in office, and in a way of
        special favour; as a spirit of illumination, regeneration,
        sanctification, and faith, as a comforter, a spirit of adoption, an
        intercessor, and as a pledge and seal of happiness: which inhabitation
        is personal; is not peculiar to him to the exclusion of the Father and
        of the Son; is expressive of property and dominion; is not confined to
        the souls of men, for he also dwells in their bodies; it is operative,
        powerful, and perpetual; it is the security of the saints' perseverance,
        and the pledge of their resurrection and future glory. This is owing not
        to any goodness in them, or to any fitness and preparations of theirs to
        receive him; but to a federal union to Christ and relation to him, to
        our Lord's ascension and intercession, and to the love and grace of the
        Father; and this proves a man to be a regenerate man, to be in the
        Spirit, and not in the flesh; for the Spirit of God is never in this
        sense in an unregenerate man, nor is he in any such sense without his
        grace; so that the indwelling of the Spirit is the grand evidence of
        relation to God, of an interest in Christ and union to him, and of a
        man's state and condition God-ward;
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. By "the
        Spirit of Christ", is not meant the human soul of Christ; nor his divine
        nature; nor his Gospel, which is the Spirit that gives life; but the
        Holy Ghost, the third person in the Trinity, the same which is called
        the Spirit before; and proves Christ to be God, he proceeds from him as
        from the Father, is sent by him, and with which Christ's human nature
        was fitted and filled. The Jews (x) often speak of , or "the spirit of
        the Messiah". Now to have him is not barely to partake of his gifts, but
        of his graces; to be possessed of him as one's own; to have communion
        with him, and to have him dwelling in us. There are some who have him
        not, nor never will have him, being none of Christ's; and God's elect,
        whilst in an unregenerate state, are without him; and whilst such,
        though they are his chosen and adopted ones, they are his by his
        Father's gift and his own purchase, they are his pardoned ones through
        his blood, and his justified ones through his righteousness; yet they
        are not his regenerated, called, and sanctified ones; nor can they claim
        any interest in him; nor are they known to be his by themselves or
        others; nor have they any communion with him, or enjoyment of him.

      And if Christ be in you,.... Not as he is in the whole world, and in all
      his creatures, or circumscriptively, and to the exclusion of himself
      elsewhere; for his person is above in heaven, his blood is within the
      vail, his righteousness is upon his people, and his Spirit and grace are
      in them; and so he comes to be in them, he is formed in their hearts by
      the Spirit of God in regeneration, when the Father reveals him not only to
      them, but in them; and he himself enters and takes possession of them as
      his own, manifests himself to them, communicates his grace, and grants
      them communion with him. This being their case,
      <p></p>
      <p>
        the body is dead because of sin: by which is meant, not the body of sin,
        though this is called a body, and a body of death, yet is not dead, much
        less is it so by reason of sin; but this fleshly body, because liable to
        afflictions, which are called deaths, has the seeds of mortality in it,
        and shall in a little time die, notwithstanding the gift of it to
        Christ, though it is redeemed by his blood, and united to him; the
        reason of it is not merely the decree of God, nor does it arise from the
        original constitution of the body, but sin is the true reason of it, sin
        original and actual, indwelling sin, but not by way of punishment for
        it, for Christ has bore that, death is one of the saints' privileges, it
        is for their good, and therefore desired by them; but that they might be
        rid of it, and free from all those troubles which are the consequences
        of it:
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        but the spirit is life, because of righteousness; not the Spirit of God,
        who lives in himself, is the author of life to others, of natural and
        spiritual life, continues as a principle of life in the saints, is the
        pledge of everlasting life, and is so to them because of the
        righteousness of Christ nor grace, or the new creature, which is
        sometimes called Spirit, and may be said to be life, it lives unto
        righteousness, and is owing to and supported by the righteousness of the
        Son of God; but the soul of man is here meant, in opposition to the
        body, which is of a spiritual nature, immaterial and immortal; and this
        may be said in believers to be life or live, for it not only lives
        naturally, but spiritually; it lives a life of holiness from Christ, a
        life of faith upon him, and a life of justification by him, and will
        live eternally; first in a separate state from the body after death,
        till the resurrection morn, it does not die with the body, nor sleep
        with it in the grave, nor is it in any "limbus" or state of purgatory,
        but in paradise, in heaven, in the arms and presence of Christ, where it
        is not inactive, but employed in the best of service: and after the
        resurrection it will live with the body in glory for evermore; and this
        is owing to righteousness, not to the righteousness of man, but the
        imputed righteousness of Christ; for as it was sin, and loss of
        righteousness thereby which brought death on man, the righteousness of
        Christ is that on which believers live now, and is their right and title
        to eternal life hereafter.

      But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead,.... These
      words are not to be understood as they are by some, of the continued work
      of sanctification in the heart by the Spirit of God; for regeneration, and
      not sanctification, is signified by quickening, which quickening occurs
      when the Spirit of God first takes up his dwelling in the soul; besides,
      the apostle had spoke of the life of the spirit or soul before; and they
      are mortal bodies, and not its mortal souls, which are said to be
      quickened, for these cannot mean the body of sin, or the remains of
      corruption, as they are said to be, and which are never quickened, nor
      never can be. To understand the words in such a sense, is not so agreeable
      to the resurrection of Christ here mentioned; whereas Christ's
      resurrection is often used as an argument of ours, which is designed here,
      where the apostle argues from the one to the other. The Spirit
      <p></p>
      <p>
        dwells in the saints as his temples: the Spirit that dwells in them is,
        "the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead"; by whom is meant
        God the Father, to whom the resurrection of Christ from the dead is here
        and elsewhere ascribed. This "periphrasis" of him is used, to express
        the power, justice, and grace of God in the resurrection of his Son; to
        show that the Spirit of God was concerned in it; and the greatness of
        the person of the Spirit that dwells in the saints; and what reason they
        have to believe the sanctification of their souls, and the redemption of
        their bodies, since such a divine Spirit dwells in them; wherefore,
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>he that raised up Christ from the dead, which is the Father,</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
        you; not the souls of the saints, for these die not: but their "bodies",
        called "mortal", because appointed to death, are under the sentence of
        it, and in which it already works; "your" bodies and not others; mortal
        ones, and not airy, celestial, immortal ones; the very same they carry
        about with them here, and in which the Spirit of God had dwelt. These
        shall be quickened. The Jews frequently express the resurrection by ,
        "the quickening of the dead" some distinguish (y) between "the
        resurrection" of the dead, which is common to the wicked, and "the
        quickening" of them, peculiar to the righteous: though, it is observed,
        this distinction does not always hold: however, this act of quickening
        seems here designed to express the peculiar blessing, of the saints; for
        though the wicked shall be raised from the dead, yet they will not rise
        with the saints, nor by virtue of union to Christ, nor to an eternal
        life of joy and happiness; in this sense the saints only will be
        quickened, "by the Spirit"; not as an instrument, but as a coefficient
        cause with the Father and Son: or "because of the Spirit that dwelleth
        in you", the bodies of the saints are the temples of the Holy Ghost,
        they are sanctified by him, where he continues to dwell by virtue of
        union to Christ, and in consequence of it will quicken them at the last
        day; so the Jews say, that the Holy Ghost brings to the resurrection of
        the dead (z).
