        <h1>Scripture Alone</h1>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
          Sola Scriptura is the principle that Scripture alone is the supreme authority in matters of 
          faith and practice. This does not mean that Scripture is the only source of knowledge, nor 
          does it reject the usefulness of church tradition, historical theology, or biblical scholarship. 
          Rather, Sola Scriptura asserts that the Bible alone is God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16-17), 
          uniquely infallible, and the ultimate standard by which all teachings, traditions, 
          and claims must be tested.
        </p>
        <p>
          A proper understanding of Sola Scriptura also acknowledges the role of subordinate authorities, 
          such as pastors, church councils, and theological writings. However, these authorities are only 
          valid insofar as they are subject to and aligned with Scripture. They do not carry independent or 
          equal authority alongside God's Word. This is seen in Acts 17:11, where the Bereans are praised 
          for examining Paul’s teaching against Scripture to verify its truth.
        </p>

        <h2>Defense</h2>
        <p>
          In defending the following three affirmations, I believe the principle of Sola Scriptura stands
          on firm ground. Moreover, grounding our beliefs in the very words of God provides epistemological
          justification and certainty that can be found in no other proposed alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Scripture is uniquely infallible and authoritative, meaning no other source we possess has the 
          same divine status; (2) Scripture is a sufficient basis for theology, indicating that no external 
          traditions, councils, or extra-biblical revelations are necessary for establishing Christian doctrine; 
          (3) Scripture is the norming norm—it is the ultimate standard by which all other norms, including 
          church practices, doctrinal statements, and ethical teachings, must be measured.
        </p>

        <h2>Infallibility</h2>
        <p>
          The infallibility of Scripture is a necessary consequence of its divine origin. If the Bible is truly the 
          Word of God, as it claims to be, then it must be without error in all that it affirms. Infallibility means 
          that Scripture cannot fail, deceive, or lead astray because it originates from a perfect, omniscient, and 
          truthful God. Just as God's nature is pure, unchanging, and entirely trustworthy, so too must be His Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scripture repeatedly affirms that God cannot lie (Titus 1:2, Hebrews 6:18) and that His word is truth (John 17:17). 
          Because God is omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), and perfectly holy, it follows that His 
          revelation to mankind must be free from error.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key passage affirming the divine nature of Scripture is 2 Timothy 3:16-17, which states, "All Scripture is 
          breathed out by God (<em>theopneustos</em>) and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training 
          in righteousness." The term <em>theopneustos</em> means that Scripture is not merely inspired in the way human writings 
          are, but that it is breathed out by God Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ, who is Himself fully God, affirmed the complete trustworthiness of Scripture. In Matthew 5:18,
          He declares, "Until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is 
          accomplished." This statement confirms that not even the smallest detail of Scripture will fail. Likewise, 
          in John 10:35, Jesus states, "Scripture cannot be broken," reinforcing its complete reliability and divine 
          authority. If Christ Himself affirmed the infallibility of Scripture, then denying it would be to contradict 
          the very words of God incarnate.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Peter 1:20-21 states, "No prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy 
          was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit." This 
          passage teaches that Scripture is not a product of human wisdom but rather the work of the Holy Spirit guiding human authors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another evidence of Scripture’s infallibility is its ability to predict future events with perfect accuracy. 
          Throughout the Bible, God declares that His word will always come to pass (Isaiah 55:11). The fulfillment of 
          messianic prophecies, such as Christ’s virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14, Matthew 1:22-23), His suffering (Isaiah 53), 
          and His resurrection (Psalm 16:10, Acts 2:31), proves that Scripture is trustworthy and incapable of error. If 
          the Bible contained errors, its prophetic accuracy would be impossible.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Sufficiency</h2>
        <p>
          Ephesians 6:10, 13, 17 explains the armor of God, where the Word of God is identified as 
          the "sword of the Spirit." This imagery presents Scripture as an offensive and defensive weapon in spiritual 
          warfare, enabling believers to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. The power of God's Word is not merely 
          intellectual but actively combats falsehood, temptation, and spiritual attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Thessalonians 2:13-14 states that the Word of God is "at work in you believers." This means that Scripture is 
          not just an external authority but an active force that transforms hearts, renews minds, and produces spiritual 
          fruit. Paul affirms that those who receive the Word as divine truth experience its power, leading to endurance 
          in suffering and obedience to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2 Timothy 2:8-9, Paul declares that although he is in chains, "the Word of God is not bound." This verse 
          underscores that Scripture's power is not limited by human constraints—imprisonment, persecution, or opposition 
          cannot silence or hinder its work. Even in the harshest circumstances, God's Word continues to advance and 
          fulfill His purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hebrews 4:12 states, "For the Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the 
          division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart." This 
          passage highlights Scripture’s ability to convict, expose sin, and penetrate the deepest parts of human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          1 Peter 1:23, 25 teaches that believers are "born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living 
          and abiding Word of God." This affirms that Scripture plays a crucial role in salvation, bringing about spiritual 
          rebirth through the proclamation of the gospel. The enduring nature of God's Word means it remains effective for all generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, 1 John 2:14 states, "I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the Word of God abides in you, and 
          you have overcome the evil one." This verse connects the indwelling of Scripture with spiritual strength and victory over 
          sin. When believers internalize and live by the Word, they gain the power to resist temptation and grow in faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          These passages collectively show that Scripture is the means by which God speaks, transforms, and empowers 
          His people. The Bible’s power is seen in its ability to penetrate hearts, sustain believers through trials, bring 
          about salvation, and equip Christians for spiritual warfare. Therefore, Scripture must be read, believed, and applied,
          as it is the divinely given means by which God carries out His purposes in the lives of believers.
        </p>

        <h2>Primacy</h2>
        <p>
          Jesus Himself condemned the elevation of tradition over God’s commands in Matthew 15:6, rebuking the Pharisees for 
          nullifying God's Word by their human traditions. Likewise, in Mark 7:8, He warned against holding to “the traditions 
          of men” rather than the commandments of God. These passages make it clear that religious customs and practices—no 
          matter how well-intentioned—must never override the divine revelation contained in Scripture. The apostles reinforced 
          this teaching, urging believers to test all doctrines against the written Word. The Bereans in Acts 17:11 were praised 
          for examining the Scriptures to verify Paul's teachings, illustrating that even apostolic instruction was subject to 
          the authority of God’s Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some argue that 2 Thessalonians 2:15 supports oral tradition as equally authoritative with Scripture, as Paul tells 
          the Thessalonians to hold fast to the traditions they received by word or letter. However, the content of those 
          apostolic traditions has been preserved in the New Testament. No extant, verifiable body of apostolic oral teaching 
          exists outside of Scripture, making it impossible to appeal to "tradition" apart from biblical revelation. Furthermore, 
          in 1 Corinthians 4:6, Paul warns believers not to go beyond what is written, demonstrating that Scripture sets the 
          boundaries for Christian doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The role of the church is not to define or create truth but to uphold and proclaim the truth revealed in Scripture 
          (1 Timothy 3:15). Church councils, creeds, and theological writings can be beneficial, but they must always be 
          evaluated against the Bible. The danger of prioritizing tradition over Scripture is evident in the development of 
          doctrines not explicitly supported by biblical teaching, such as purgatory, indulgences, and the Marian dogmas 
          within Roman Catholicism. These doctrines arose primarily through church tradition rather than clear biblical 
          revelation, leading to deviations from the gospel. Colossians 2:8 warns against being led astray by human traditions 
          and empty philosophies that are not rooted in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even authoritative religious figures, including church leaders and councils, must be tested by Scripture. 
          Galatians 1:8 strongly warns against accepting any gospel that deviates from the one originally revealed—even 
          if preached by an angel. This principle extends to all human authority, including the papacy, clergy, and church 
          fathers. 2 John 10-11 further commands believers to reject anyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ, 
          showing that tradition or religious office does not exempt one from biblical accountability.
