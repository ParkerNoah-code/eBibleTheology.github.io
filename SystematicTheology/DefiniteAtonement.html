      <h1>Definite Atonement</h1>
      <h3>Justification of Theologizing</h3>
      <p>
        Michael Riccardi, To Save Sinners: A Critical Evaluation of the Multiple
        Intentions View of the Atonement (Eugene, Oregon: Wipf and Stock, 2023):
        "there is no conflict between faithful exegesis and sound theology.
        Sometimes, well-meaning opponents of particular redemption mistakenly
        divorce exegesis and theology by making the argument that particularism
        is theologically sound (because, for example, it provides for unity in
        the saving will of the Trinity, and because it is consistent with the
        other doctrines of grace, which these opponents affirm) but exegetically
        untenable (because of a set of passages that speak of Christ’s death for
        'all' or for 'the world')."
      </p>
      <p>
        He goes on to address this concern, "However, such thinking misconceives
        theology as something other than the coherent holding together of the
        exegesis of individual texts of Scripture, and it misconceives exegesis
        as something other than that which must press to a conclusion and be
        coherently held together with the exegetical conclusions of the rest of
        Scripture. Genuine systematic theology must arise from sound exegesis,
        and genuine exegesis must issue in sound systematic theology; they can
        never be at odds with one another."
      </p>
      <p>
        Explaining further, "Berkhof rightly observes, 'There seems to be a
        lurking fear that the more we systematize the truth, the farther we
        wander from the presentation of it that is found in the Word of God.'
        His reply is also accurate: there is no danger of sacrificing exegesis
        to 'the system' so long as that system 'is not based on the fundamental
        principles of some erring philosophy, but on the abiding principles of
        Scripture itself' (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 15). This is the
        standard at which this project aims."
      </p>

      <h3>Romans 5:8</h3>
      <p>
        Romans 5:10 says, “For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to
        God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will
        be saved by his life.” This shows that Christ’s death actually
        accomplished reconciliation, not potentially, but objectively, for those
        who were His enemies. It doesn't say we might be reconciled, but that we
        were reconciled through His death. This reconciliation leads certainly
        to final salvation, proving that the atonement was definite and
        effective for a particular people, not a general offer to all.
      </p>

      <h3>Penal Substitutionary Atonement</h3>
      <p>
        Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) is the doctrine that Jesus died in
        the place of sinners, bearing the penalty they deserved, satisfying the
        justice of God fully and finally.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Jesus truly paid for someone’s sins, then those sins cannot be
        punished again. God is just and if His justice is satisfied, His wrath
        will not continue against those sins. Therefore, those for whom Christ
        died must be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Jesus died for every person without exception in this way, then
        either everyone must be saved (which the Bible clearly denies), or His
        death fails to save people. This would mean Christ only made salvation
        possible, not actual, but this contradicts PSA and the propitiatory
        nature of Christ's sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since not all are saved, and God will still judge many, Jesus could not
        have been a substitute for them. Therefore, His atonement was definite
        and effective only for those He intended to save, the elect, the church,
        His people, His sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
        1 John 2:2 says, “He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for
        ours only, but also for the whole world.” This doesn’t mean every person
        without exception. If Christ had truly borne the sins of all, then no
        one could face judgment. But many do.
      </p>
      <p>
        John 3:36 says, “He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who
        disobeys the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”
        This proves that some still bear God’s wrath, showing Christ was not a
        propitiation for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        John 3:16 says, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and
        only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have
        eternal life.” The love of God is shown in the giving of the Son in such
        a way that all the believing ones are actually saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves definite atonement. Jesus died specifically for His people,
        not for all people. His death actually saves people.
      </p>

      <h3>Implication</h3>
      <p>
        As a result, the content of our gospel proclamation should be shaped by
        the theological clarity and precision afforded by the doctrine of
        definite atonement. Evangelistically, we do not presume to know for whom
        Christ died by declaring to every individual, "Christ died for you."
        Rather, we declare the free and sincere offer of the gospel: "If you
        repent and believe in Christ, you will be saved, and you will know that
        His blood was shed to cleanse you from all your sins."
      </p>
      <p>
        This preserves the integrity of the universal gospel offer while
        maintaining the particular efficacy of the atonement. It is consistent
        with the biblical pattern of apostolic preaching, which calls all people
        everywhere to repent, while affirming that the atonement effectively
        secures salvation for the elect alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salvation, therefore, is not contingent upon the will or decision of
        man, but is rooted in the eternal purposes of God (Eph. 1:4–5; Rom.
        8:29–30). The ground of our assurance lies not in the strength or
        quality of our faith itself, but in the objective reality of Christ's
        substitutionary death and victorious resurrection. Faith, as the
        instrument by which we lay hold of Christ, is thus evidence of election
        and provides assurance subjectively. Thus, our confidence in salvation
        rests solely and securely in the finished work of Christ, applied by the
        Spirit, and confirmed through persevering faith and fruit.
