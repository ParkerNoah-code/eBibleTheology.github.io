      <h1>Definite Atonement</h1>
      <p>
        Michael Riccardi, To Save Sinners: A Critical Evaluation of the Multiple
        Intentions View of the Atonement (Eugene, Oregon: Wipf and Stock, 2023):
        "there is no conflict between faithful exegesis and sound theology.
        Sometimes, well-meaning opponents of particular redemption mistakenly
        divorce exegesis and theology by making the argument that particularism
        is theologically sound (because, for example, it provides for unity in
        the saving will of the Trinity, and because it is consistent with the
        other doctrines of grace, which these opponents affirm) but exegetically
        untenable (because of a set of passages that speak of Christâ€™s death for
        'all' or for 'the world')."
      </p>
      <p>
        He goes on to address this concern, "However, such thinking misconceives
        theology as something other than the coherent holding together of the
        exegesis of individual texts of Scripture, and it misconceives exegesis
        as something other than that which must press to a conclusion and be
        coherently held together with the exegetical conclusions of the rest of
        Scripture. Genuine systematic theology must arise from sound exegesis,
        and genuine exegesis must issue in sound systematic theology; they can
        never be at odds with one another."
      </p>
      <p>
        He goes on to write, "Berkhof rightly observes, 'There seems to be a
        lurking fear that the more we systematize the truth, the farther we
        wander from the presentation of it that is found in the Word of God.'
        His reply is also accurate: there is no danger of sacrificing exegesis
        to 'the system' so long as that system 'is not based on the fundamental
        principles of some erring philosophy, but on the abiding principles of
        Scripture itself' (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 15). This is the
        standard at which this project aims."
