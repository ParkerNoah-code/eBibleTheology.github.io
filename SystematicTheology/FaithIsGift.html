      <h1>Faith is a Gift</h1>
      <h2>A. Faith as a Result of God's Grace</h2>
      <p>
        Genuine faith cannot be generated through human effort or willpower but
        is fundamentally a gift that flows from God's grace. This section
        examines passages that clearly establish faith as God's gracious gift
        rather than human achievement.
      </p>
      <p><b>Ephesians 2:8-10</b></p>
      <p>
        "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
        yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should
        boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good
        works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
      </p>
      <p>
        This key passage explicitly identifies faith as God's gift, not
        something self-generated. The construction of the Greek text indicates
        that the entire salvation process—including the faith that receives
        it—originates in God's grace rather than human initiative. Faith serves
        as the instrument through which grace is received, but even this
        instrument is divinely provided.
      </p>
      <p><b>Titus 3:5</b></p>
      <p>
        "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His
        mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of
        the Holy Spirit."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul directly contrasts human works of righteousness with God's mercy as
        the source of salvation. Faith is encompassed within this salvation that
        stems purely from divine mercy. The "washing of regeneration" refers to
        the Holy Spirit's transformative work that enables faith, establishing
        that faith follows the Spirit's regenerating activity rather than
        preceding it.
      </p>
      <p><b>Romans 9:16</b></p>
      <p>
        "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who
        shows mercy."
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse comes in the context Paul's discussion of divine election. It
        establishes that salvation—including the faith component—does not result
        from human determination ("him who wills") or human exertion ("him who
        runs"). Rather, faith flows exclusively from God's sovereign mercy. This
        dismantles any notion that faith originates from an autonomous human
        decision independent of divine enabling.
      </p>
      <p><b>2 Timothy 2:24-25</b></p>
      <p>
        "The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to
        teach, patient, in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps
        God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the
        truth..."
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse shows that repentance—the companion of faith—must be "given"
        or "granted" by God. This reinforces that the entire conversion process,
        including both faith and repentance, depends on divine grace rather than
        human capacity.
      </p>

      <h2>B. Faith as New Birth Through God's Initiative</h2>
      <p>
        Faith emerges not from human decision but from spiritual rebirth
        initiated entirely by God. This section explores passages that establish
        regeneration as the divine precursor to faith, showing how saving faith
        flows from God's transformative work in the human heart.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 1:12-13</b></p>
      <p>
        "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become
        children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of
        blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
        God."
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage reveals that while belief and reception of Christ are human
        responses, the spiritual birth that enables these responses comes
        exclusively from God's will. John explicitly eliminates three potential
        human sources of spiritual birth—natural descent ("blood"), human desire
        ("will of the flesh"), and human decision ("will of man")—affirming that
        the capacity to believe originates in God's sovereign initiative.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 3:3-8</b></p>
      <p>
        "Jesus answered him, 'Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born
        anew, he can’t see God’s Kingdom'... 'That which is born of the flesh is
        flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit... The wind blows
        where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes
        from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.'"
      </p>
      <p>
        In this conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus establishes that spiritual
        perception and entrance into God's kingdom require prior spiritual
        birth. The analogy of wind emphasizes that this birth operates according
        to the Spirit's sovereign freedom rather than human control. This birth
        precedes and enables faith rather than resulting from it.
      </p>
      <p><b>1 John 5:1</b></p>
      <p>
        "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone
        who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Greek verb tense in this verse indicates that being "born of God" is
        the antecedent condition to believing in Jesus. Faith is thus presented
        as the evidence and fruit of divine birth rather than its cause. This
        reinforces that regeneration precedes faith in the ordo salutis (order
        of salvation).
      </p>
      <p><b>James 1:18</b></p>
      <p>
        "Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might
        be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures."
      </p>
      <p>
        James attributes spiritual birth ("brought us forth") entirely to God's
        sovereign will, accomplished through the word of truth. This divine
        initiative establishes that faith does not generate new birth; rather,
        new birth generates faith.
      </p>
      <p><b>Ezekiel 36:26-27</b></p>
      <p>
        "I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within
        you. I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give
        you a heart of flesh. I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to
        walk in my statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them."
      </p>
      <p>
        This prophetic passage illuminates the divine initiative in spiritual
        transformation. God promises to replace the unresponsive heart with a
        responsive one and to put His Spirit within people, enabling obedience.
        This Old Testament foundation supports the New Testament teaching that
        faith flows from God's prior work of heart renewal.
      </p>

      <h2>C. Faith as a Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit's essential role in producing faith reveals its divine
        origin. This section examines passages demonstrating that saving faith
        is cultivated by the Spirit's work rather than through human capacity or
        reasoning.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 6:29</b></p>
      <p>
        "Jesus answered and said to them, ‘This is the work of God, that you
        believe in Him whom He sent.’"
      </p>
      <p>
        In direct response to those asking about performing "the works of God,"
        Jesus reframes their understanding by identifying belief itself as God's
        work. This statement establishes that faith is not a human work that
        earns salvation, but a divine work within the human heart that brings
        salvation. Jesus locates the source of faith in God's activity rather
        than human capability.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 6:44-45</b></p>
      <p>
        "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I
        will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, ‘And
        they shall all be taught by God.’ Therefore everyone who has heard and
        learned from the Father comes to Me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus emphatically declares the impossibility of coming to Him without
        the Father's drawing. The universal negative ("no one") eliminates any
        exception to this spiritual inability. Faith requires divine enabling
        through the Father's drawing and teaching.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 6:63-65</b></p>
      <p>
        "'It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words
        that I speak to you are spirit, and are life. But there are some of you
        who don’t believe.' For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who
        didn’t believe, and who it was who would betray him. He said, 'For this
        cause I have said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given
        to him by my Father.' At this, many of his disciples went back and
        walked no more with him."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus attributes spiritual life—which includes faith—to the Spirit's
        work, while explicitly denying the flesh's ability to help in any way.
        And he connects unbelief to the absence of the Father's enabling grace.
      </p>
      <p><b>1 Corinthians 2:4-5, 14</b></p>
      <p>
        "My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human
        wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith
        wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.… Now the
        natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are
        foolishness to him; and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually
        discerned."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul contrasts human wisdom with the Spirit's power as the foundation
        for genuine faith. He explains that natural human faculties cannot
        comprehend spiritual truths without the Spirit's illumination. This
        renders saving faith impossible apart from the Spirit's work, since the
        gospel appears as foolishness to the natural man.
      </p>
      <p><b>Acts 16:14</b></p>
      <p>
        "A certain woman named Lydia... heard us. The Lord opened her heart to
        listen to the things which were spoken by Paul."
      </p>
      <p>
        This historical account of Lydia's conversion explicitly attributes her
        receptivity to the gospel to the Lord's action of opening her heart. Her
        faith resulted from divine intervention rather than merely human
        persuasion or decision.
      </p>

      <h2>D. Faith as God's Sovereign Work in Believers</h2>
      <p><b>Philippians 1:6</b></p>
      <p>
        "Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work
        in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul expresses certainty that God, who initiates salvation, will
        faithfully continue and perfect this work until Christ's return.
      </p>
      <p><b>Philippians 1:29</b></p>
      <p>
        "For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe
        in Him, but also to suffer for His sake."
      </p>
      <p>
        The explicit declaration that belief is "granted" (literally "given as a
        gift") removes any doubt about faith's origin. Paul places faith in the
        category of divine gifts alongside suffering for Christ. The passive
        voice ("it has been granted") emphasizes the believers' role as
        recipients rather than originators of faith. This underscores that faith
        is bestowed by God's sovereign decree rather than produced by human
        determination.
      </p>
      <p><b>Philippians 2:12-13</b></p>
      <p>
        "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who
        works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure."
      </p>
      <p>
        While believers actively participate in their spiritual growth, Paul
        immediately grounds this activity in God's prior and primary work. The
        faith that fuels obedience flows from God's internal operation of both
        the desire ("to will") and the ability ("to do"). The ongoing exercise
        of faith depends on God's continuous empowerment.
      </p>
      <p><b>2 Peter 1:1, 3</b></p>
      <p>
        "To those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the
        righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ… as His divine power
        has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through
        the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue."
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter describes faith as something "obtained" through Christ's
        righteousness rather than generated by human effort. The passive
        language emphasizes reception rather than achievement. The source of
        this faith is further identified as God's "divine power" which provides
        everything necessary for spiritual life. Faith is necessary for
        spiritual life. Therefore, faith is an element of God's comprehensive
        provision for believers rather than a human contribution to salvation.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hebrews 12:2</b></p>
      <p>"looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith"</p>
      <p>
        Jesus is both the "author" (originator) and "perfecter" (finisher) of
        faith. By attributing the entirety of faith's development to Christ's
        work, the writer removes any ground for viewing faith as a
        self-generated human accomplishment. Faith thus stands as Christ's
        creation.
      </p>

      <h2>E. Faith as the Result of God's Call and Election</h2>
      <p>
        Faith emerges as the manifestation of God's eternal purpose in choosing
        individuals for salvation. This section examines passages that connect
        faith to divine election, revealing how belief flows from God's
        sovereign calling rather than preceding or determining it.
      </p>
      <p><b>Acts 13:48</b></p>
      <p>
        "Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word
        of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed to eternal life
        believed."
      </p>
      <p>
        This historical account establishes a direct causal relationship between
        divine appointment and human belief. The text specifically states that
        those who believed were those who "had been appointed to eternal life,"
        indicating that faith follows from God's prior determination. The
        passive voice ("had been appointed") emphasizes God's action rather than
        human initiative, demonstrating that faith is the result rather than the
        cause of divine election.
      </p>
      <p><b>Romans 8:28-30</b></p>
      <p>
        "We know that all things work together for good for those who love God,
        for those who are called according to his purpose... For whom he
        foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son,
        that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. Whom he predestined,
        those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he
        justified, those he also glorified."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul presents what theologians commonly refer to as the "golden chain of
        redemption." This shows the sequence of divine actions that begins with
        God's foreknowledge and culminates in the glorification of believers.
        Each step in this sequence is interconnected, indivisible, and
        ultimately driven by the sovereign action of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        God's foreknowledge involves His divine, intimate knowledge of certain
        people beforehand. It does not merely imply an awareness of what will
        happen; instead, it signifies God's relational and intentional
        knowing—choosing and setting His affection on certain individuals
        beforehand.
      </p>
      <p><b>2 Thessalonians 2:13-14</b></p>
      <p>
        "But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved
        by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation
        through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, to which
        He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
        Jesus Christ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul links the Thessalonian believers' faith and sanctification directly
        to God's eternal choice ("from the beginning chose you for salvation").
        This indicates that election precedes and determines faith rather than
        faith triggering election. Belief in the gospel is the means through
        which God's sovereign selection becomes manifest in an individual's
        life, empowered and made effective through the sanctifying work of the
        Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p><b>1 Peter 1:1-2</b></p>
      <p>
        "to the chosen [elect] ones... according to the foreknowledge of God the
        Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ
        and be sprinkled with his blood"
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter addresses believers as "elect according to the foreknowledge of
        God," establishing their faith as flowing from divine election. The
        purpose clause "for obedience" (which includes the obedience of faith)
        shows that faith follows from election rather than determining it. Faith
        is the intended result of God's electing purpose, not its prerequisite.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 10:26-27</b></p>
      <p>
        "But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
        My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus directly attributes unbelief to the fact that certain individuals
        are "not of My sheep" rather than explaining their exclusion from His
        flock as resulting from their unbelief. This reverses the natural human
        reasoning that would make sheep status dependent on believing. Instead,
        belief is the consequence of being Christ's sheep, demonstrating that
        faith flows from divine election.
