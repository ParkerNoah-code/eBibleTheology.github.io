      <h1>Faith is a Gift</h1>
      <h2>A. Faith as a Result of God's Grace</h2>
      <p><b>Ephesians 2:8-10</b></p>
      <p>
        "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
        yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should
        boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good
        works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage explicitly states that faith is a gift from God. Salvation
        does not come from human effort or merit but is entirely the result of
        God’s grace. Since faith itself is included in this divine gift, it is
        not something that originates from human willpower or decision but from
        God’s sovereign bestowal.
      </p>
      <p><b>Titus 3:5</b></p>
      <p>
        "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His
        mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of
        the Holy Spirit."
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, salvation is attributed solely to God's mercy rather than human
        righteousness. This underscores that faith, being part of salvation, is
        not achieved by personal effort but is granted by God through the
        regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p><b>Romans 9:16</b></p>
      <p>
        "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who
        shows mercy."
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse reinforces the teaching that salvation—and consequently
        faith—is not based on human decision or exertion but is entirely
        dependent on God’s mercy. Faith is not something one musters up but is
        sovereignly granted by God.
      </p>
      <h2>B. Faith as God’s Sovereign Work in Believers</h2>
      <p><b>Philippians 1:6</b></p>
      <p>
        "Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work
        in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul assures believers that the faith initiated in them is a work of
        God, which He will bring to completion. This confirms that faith is not
        self-generated but is divinely originated and sustained.
      </p>
      <p><b>Philippians 1:29</b></p>
      <p>
        "For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe
        in Him, but also to suffer for His sake."
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse explicitly states that belief in Christ is something that is
        "granted" to believers. This indicates that faith is a gift given by God
        rather than something human beings produce on their own.
      </p>
      <p><b>Philippians 2:12-13</b></p>
      <p>
        "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who
        works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure."
      </p>
      <p>
        While believers are called to actively live out their salvation, this
        passage clarifies that it is ultimately God who is at work within them,
        both in their will and in their actions. This divine empowerment
        includes the faith necessary to believe and obey.
      </p>
      <p><b>2 Peter 1:1, 3</b></p>
      <p>
        "To those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the
        righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ… as His divine power
        has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through
        the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue."
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is described as something "obtained" rather than self-generated.
        It is received through the righteousness of Christ and granted by His
        divine power, emphasizing that faith is given, not earned.
      </p>
      <h2>C. Faith as a Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
      <p><b>John 6:29</b></p>
      <p>
        "Jesus answered and said to them, ‘This is the work of God, that you
        believe in Him whom He sent.’"
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus makes it clear that belief in Him is the work of God, not merely a
        human choice. Faith is therefore not something that originates from
        human initiative but is a divine work.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 6:44-45</b></p>
      <p>
        "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I
        will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, ‘And
        they shall all be taught by God.’ Therefore everyone who has heard and
        learned from the Father comes to Me."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus explicitly states that no one can come to Him unless drawn by the
        Father. This indicates that faith is the result of God's initiative, not
        human decision. The drawing of the Father is essential for belief.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 6:51, 63</b></p>
      <p>
        "I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of
        this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My
        flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world… It is the Spirit
        who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you
        are spirit, and they are life."
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ affirms that the Spirit gives life, meaning that faith and
        spiritual understanding come from the Spirit, not human ability. The
        flesh alone cannot produce saving faith.
      </p>
      <p><b>1 Corinthians 2:4, 14</b></p>
      <p>
        "And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human
        wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power… But the natural
        man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
        foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually
        discerned."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul explains that faith does not come through human reasoning or
        persuasion but through the Spirit’s power. Without the Spirit, a person
        cannot understand or accept spiritual truths, showing that faith is a
        divine work.
      </p>
      <h2>D. Faith as the Result of God's Call and Election</h2>
      <p><b>Acts 13:48</b></p>
      <p>
        "Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word
        of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed to eternal life
        believed."
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage clearly states that those who believed had been "appointed
        to eternal life." Faith follows God’s appointment, showing that belief
        is a result of His sovereign choice.
      </p>
      <p><b>Romans 8:27-30</b></p>
      <p>
        "Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is,
        because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of
        God… whom He foreknew, He also predestined… called… justified…
        glorified."
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is part of God’s predetermined plan, beginning with His
        foreknowledge and culminating in justification and glorification. This
        shows that faith is not random or self-generated but is part of God's
        sovereign work.
      </p>
      <p><b>2 Thessalonians 2:13-14</b></p>
      <p>
        "But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved
        by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation
        through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, to which
        He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
        Jesus Christ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is connected to God’s calling and election. Believers come to
        faith because they were chosen by God for salvation, reinforcing that
        faith is a divine gift.
      </p>
      <h2>E. Faith as New Birth Through God's Initiative</h2>
      <p><b>John 1:12-13</b></p>
      <p>
        "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become
        children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of
        blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
        God."
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith and new birth are attributed to God’s will, not human effort. This
        confirms that faith originates from God's initiative.
      </p>
      <p><b>John 3:6-8</b></p>
      <p>
        "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
        Spirit is spirit… The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound
        of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is
        everyone who is born of the Spirit."
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus emphasizes that spiritual birth, which includes faith, is a work
        of the Holy Spirit, not human will.
      </p>
      <p><b>1 John 5:1</b></p>
      <p>
        "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone
        who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him."
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is a sign of being born of God, meaning that it follows
        regeneration, rather than preceding it.
      </p>
      <p><b>James 1:18</b></p>
      <p>
        "Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might
        be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures."
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is the result of God’s will in bringing about spiritual birth
        through His word.
