      <h1>Atonement</h1>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        J. I. Packer, Concise Theology: A Guide to Historic Christian Beliefs
        (Wheaton: Tyndale, 1993), 134: "<em>Atonement</em> means making amends,
        blotting out the offense, and giving satisfaction for wrong done; thus
        reconciling to oneself the alienated other and restoring the disrupted
        relationship."
      </p>
      <p>
        John M. Frame, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief
        (Phillipsburg: P&amp;R, 2013), 901: "Jesus’ atoning sacrifice fulfills
        the OT sacrifices of bulls, goats, lambs, doves, flour, wine, and oil.
        In the OT, God used those sacrifices to teach the people what Jesus was
        later going to do. So we can learn from those sacrifices about the
        meaning of Jesus’ atonement."
      </p>

      <h3>Penalty</h3>
      <p>
        "For the life of the flesh is in the blood. I have given it to you on
        the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that
        makes atonement by reason of the life" (Lev 17:11).
      </p>
      <p>
        "whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice through faith in his blood,
        for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of
        prior sins, in God’s forbearance; to demonstrate his righteousness at
        this present time, that he might himself be just and the justifier of
        him who has faith in Jesus" (Rom 3:25-26).
      </p>
      <p>
        "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life
        in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom 6:23).
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremy Treat, The Atonement: An Introduction, Short Studies in
        Systematic Theology (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2023), 49: "God is a good
        King who loves his creation and is, therefore, opposed to that which
        violates its goodness. Because of his love (not in spite of it), God
        responds to sin... God’s response to sin, therefore, is judgment (2 Cor.
        5:10), punishment (2 Thess. 1:9), wrath (John 3:36), a curse (Deut.
        11:28), exile (2 Kings 17:6–7), and ultimately death (Rom. 6:23). This
        is the penalty of sin."

          >In My Place Condemned He Stood: Penal Substitutionary Atonement</a
        >: "What is the just punishment for our rebellion against God? The
        Bible’s answer is death. God gave us life. To take his gift and reject
        the giver is treason. It is a capital offence. 'The wages of sin is
        death' as Paul says in Romans 6... The truth that Christ in his death
        took the penalty for my sins is something that fills out hearts even as
        it exercises our minds."

        <a

          target="_blank"
          >Systematic Theology</a
        >, 3.4, The Nature of the Atonement: "There are several passages in
        Scripture which speak of our sins as being 'laid upon' Christ, and of
        His 'bearing' sin or iniquity, Isa. 53:6,12; John 1:29; II Cor. 5:21;
        Gal. 3:13; Heb. 9:28; I Pet. 2:24. On the basis of Scripture we can,
        therefore, say that our sins are imputed [or credited] to Christ. This
        does not mean that our sinfulness was transferred to Him — something
        that is in itself utterly impossible — but that the guilt of our sin was
        imputed [or reckoned] to Him."
      </p>

      <h3>Righteousness</h3>
      <p>
        "But to him who doesn’t work, but believes in him who justifies the
        ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness. Even as David also
        pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart
        from works" (Rom 4:5-6).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from
        God’s wrath through him" (Rom 5:9).
      </p>
      <p>
        "and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which
        is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the
        righteousness which is from God by faith" (Philippians 3:9).
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert L. Reymond, A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith,
        2nd. Ed., (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1998), 631: "His preceptive [in law
        obeying] and his penal [in taking our penalty] obedience, then,
        particularly as the latter came to expression in his cross work, is the
        ground of God's justification of sinners (see Rom. 5:9), by which divine
        act they are
        <em>pardoned</em> (because their sins were charged to Christ who
        obediently bore the law's sanctions against them) and
        <em>accepted as righteous</em> in God's sight (because Christ's
        preceptive obedience or perfect righteousness is imputed to them through
        faith)."
      </p>

      <h3>Two Key Verses</h3>
      <p>
        "For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf, so that in him
        we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:21).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for
        us. For it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree'..."
        (Galatians 3:13).
      </p>
      <p>
        John Stott, The Cross of Christ (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2006), 143,
        148: "It is clear from Old Testament usage that to 'bear sin' means...
        specifically to endure its penal consequences, to undergo its penalty...
        The sinless one was 'made sin for us,' which must mean that he bore the
        penalty of our sin instead of us, and he redeemed us from the law’s
        curse by 'becoming a curse for us,' which must mean that the curse of
        the law lying upon us for our disobedience was transferred to him, so
        that he bore it instead of us."

      <p class="not-indented">
        1. The atonement is grounded in the holiness of God who, being perfectly
        holy, hates and punishes sin.
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">2. A penalty for sin must be paid.</p>
      <p class="not-indented">
        3. People cannot pay the penalty for their sins and live; rather, the
        penalty is death.
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">
        4. Only God can pay the penalty for sin, but he must partake of human
        nature to pay for human beings.
      </p>
      <p class="not-indented">
        5. By his death, the God-man, Jesus Christ, atoned for human sin.

          >The Holy Spirit’s Crucial Role in Penal Substitutionary Atonement</a
        >: "Because God is triune, the work of the second person is never
        separated from the work of the first and third persons... So also here,
        the three persons acted indivisibly in the divine work of atonement...
        [T]he incarnate Son underwent his act of penal substitutionary
        atonement, upheld to the end by the Holy Spirit... Jesus 'through the
        eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God.' [Heb 9:14]"

        salvation of all people without exception, but as actually accomplishing
        salvation for all for whom he died."

          >The Case For Definite Atonement</a
        >: "Particular redemption is an inevitable implicate of a recognition of
        the penal substitutionary nature of the atonement... If we do hold that
        Christ died substitutionally for all mankind bearing the divine penalty
        for the sins of all men, it would appear that at the day of judgment
        there will remain nothing to be punished, and consequently all men
        should be saved."

      <h1>Verses</h1>
      <h3>Sacrifice</h3>
      <p>
        "For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place." (1
        Cor 5:7).
      </p>
      <p>
        "who doesn’t need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices
        daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For
        he did this once for all, when he offered up himself." (Heb 7:27).
      </p>
      <p>
        "so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will
        appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to save those who are
        eagerly waiting for him." (Heb 9:28).
      </p>
      <p>
        "we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus
        Christ once for all." (Heb 10:10).
      </p>
      <p>
        "but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on
        the right hand of God" (Heb 10:12).
      </p>
      <p>
        "For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being
        sanctified." (Heb 10:14).
      </p>

      <h3>Body</h3>
      <p>
        "you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you
        would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we
        might produce fruit to God" (Rom 7:4).
      </p>
      <p>
        Douglas J. Moo, The Letter to the Romans. 2nd ed., NICNT (Grand Rapids:
        Eerdmans, 2018), 443: "A few interpreters have thought... believers are
        put to death to the law by belonging to the church, the body of Christ.
        Others suggest that Paul may be connoting the solidarity of believers
        with Christ in his death. But Paul has laid no groundwork in Romans for
        this application; he must be referring to the physical body of Christ,
        put to death on the cross for us."
      </p>
      <p>
        "he has reconciled [you] in the body of his flesh through death, to
        present you holy and without defect and blameless before him" (Col
        1:22).
      </p>
      <p>
        "we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus
        Christ once for all" (Heb 10:7).
      </p>
      <p>
        "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died
        to sins, might live to righteousness. You were healed by his wounds" (1
        Pet 2:24).
      </p>

      <h3>Blood</h3>
      <p>
        "Take heed, therefore, to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the
        Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord
        and God which he purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28).
      </p>
      <p>
        Darrell L. Bock, Acts, BECNT (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2007), 630: "The
        picture is like what Abraham had been willing to do with Isaac (Gen.
        22), only here God does carry out the offering so that others can
        benefit from the sacrifice ('purchased' in Isa. 43:21; Ps. 74:2). Thus
        the acquiring of the church had as its basis a substitution of God's own
        for those God would bring to eternal life."

          >The Meaning of the Word 'Blood' In Scripture</a
        >, (London: Tyndale, 1948): "To speak, therefore, of Christ's shed blood
        is to acknowledge the amazing fact that He, the sinless Son of God,
        actually as Man died the kind of death which only sinners ought to die.
        All our references to 'Christ's blood' ought therefore to involve the
        significant recollection that His human life in this world came to an
        end by the violent rending of His flesh; and that, as though He Himself
        were a sinner, He died the sinner's kind of death (i.e., a
        blood-shedding death); and it is because He died the kind of death that
        sinners ought to die, that sinners can by faith in Him and Him crucified
        be saved from sin and all its dire consequences."

        over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance" (Rom 3:24-25).

        Eerdmans, 2018), 250-251: "In Paul's day, 'redemption' often referred to
        a transaction whereby prisoners of war, condemned criminals, and
        (especially) slaves were able to purchase their freedom... Paul is...
        presenting Christ's death as a 'ransom,' a 'payment' that takes the
        place of that penalty for sins 'owed' by all people to God."

      <p>
        "He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our
        trespasses, wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against
        us. He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. Having
        stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them
        openly, triumphing over them in it" (Col 2:13-15).

        death, to present you holy and without defect and blameless before him"
        (Col 1:21-22)

        "For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation
        through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or
        sleep, we should live together with him" (1 Thes 5:9).

        "But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus,
        because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by
        the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone" (Heb 2:9).

        "Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself
        in the same way partook of the same, that through death he might bring
        to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might
        deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
        subject to bondage" (Heb 2:14-15).

        "For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has
        occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
        first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise
        of the eternal inheritance" (Heb 9:15).
