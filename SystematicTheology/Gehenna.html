      <h1>Final Punishment</h1>
      <h2>The Doctrine of Hell</h2>
      <h3>Preliminary Facts</h3>
      <p>
        People know that they deserve death: "who, knowing the ordinance of God,
        that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the
        same, but also approve of those who practice them" (Romans 1:32).
      </p>
      <p>
        The punishment for sin is death: "The LORD God commanded the man,
        saying, 'You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but you shall
        not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day
        that you eat of it, you will surely die'... The serpent said to the
        woman, 'You won’t really die'" (Gen 2:16-17; 3:4). "For the wages of sin
        is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our
        Lord" (Romans 6:23).
      </p>
      <p>
        Those outside of Christ fear death: "Since then the children have shared
        in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of the same,
        that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of
        death, that is, the devil, and might deliver all of them who through
        fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage" (Hebrews
        2:14-15).
      </p>
      <p>
        Death is the common fate of all apart from Christ: "For he sees that
        wise men die; likewise the fool and the senseless perish, and leave
        their wealth to others. Their inward thought is that their houses will
        endure forever, and their dwelling places to all generations. They name
        their lands after themselves. But man, despite his riches, doesn’t
        endure. He is like the animals that perish" (Psalm 49:10-12).
      </p>
      <p>
        Immortality is not inherent to humans, but is a gift to be received
        through faith: "He alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable
        light..." (1 Timothy 6:16). "... Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and
        brought life and immortality to light through the Good News" (2 Timothy
        1:10).
      </p>
      <p>
        Eternal life is a gift, not a given: "I give eternal life to them. They
        will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand" (John
        10:28).
      </p>
      <p>
        Fire consistently conveys destruction: "'For behold, the day comes,
        burning like a furnace, when all the proud and all who work wickedness
        will be stubble. The day that comes will burn them up,' says the LORD of
        Armies, 'so that it will leave them neither root nor branch'" (Malachi
        4:1). "He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will
        burn up with unquenchable fire" (Matthew 3:12).
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ suffered the penalty we deserved, death, in our place: "But he
        was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities.
        The punishment that brought our peace was on him; and by his wounds we
        are healed... As a lamb that is led to the slaughter... They made his
        grave with the wicked... he poured out his soul to death" (Isaiah 53:5,
        7, 9, 12). "But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we
        were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).
      </p>

      <h3>Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        The King James Version translates the words Sheol, Hades, Tartarus, and
        Gehenna as hell. This is inaccurate and confusing in modern English.
        There are still many modern translations which translate these words
        inconsistently, but Gehenna is the only one that refers to the final
        fate of the wicked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gehenna, the shortened name for the valley of Hinnom, became notorious
        during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh as the location where
        children were sacrificed by fire to the god Molech (2 Chron 28:3; 33:6).
        The valley, we are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would be called
        a place of slaughter where it was prophesied to be filled with the
        corpses of those who had turned away from God. This valley thus became
        synonymous with divine punishment, where the dead bodies of the slain
        were left unburied and exposed to decay and scavengers, painting a vivid
        picture of desolation and wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gehenna in the New Testament represents not just bodily destruction, but
        the culmination of divine judgment where the opportunity for salvation
        is irrevocably withdrawn, and the wicked face complete destruction of
        soul and body by God. Jesus uses Gehenna eschatologically to illustrate
        the final death of the wicked (Mat 5:22, 29-30, 18:9). This imagery
        resonates with Isaiah 66:24, a verse Jesus quotes when speaking of
        Gehenna, reinforcing the notion of Gehenna as a place of total
        destruction. This is consistent with Paul who speaks of the ultimate
        fate of the wicked in terms of destruction (Phil 1:28; 3:18-19; Rom
        9:22-24; 2 Thes 1:8-9).
      </p>
      <p>
        A common myth is that the Valley of Hinnom was a garbage dump that was
        always burning with fire, and therefore provided good imagery for
        eternal torment. However, there is not any evidence for this claim which
        was first made by Rabbi David Kimhi around A.D. 1200. Although the
        garbage dump theory is commonly stated in study Bibles and commentaries
        to support the doctrine of eternal torment, there is no archeological or
        literary evidence to back it up. The reality is that the Old Testament
        provides the background for Gehenna as a place of slaughter, death, and
        destruction.

      <h3>Key Verses</h3>
      <p>
        "Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh
        out of the sky. He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the
        inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground" (Genesis
        19:24-25). "Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them,
        having in the same way as these given themselves over to sexual
        immorality and gone after strange flesh, are shown as an example,
        suffering the punishment of eternal fire." (Jude 7), "and turning the
        cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction,
        having made them an example to those who would live in an ungodly way"
        (2 Peter 2:6).
      </p>
      <p>
        "'Therefore behold, the days come', says Yahweh, 'that it will no more
        be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The
        valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no
        place to bury. The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds
        of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them
        away'" (Jeremiah 7:32-33).
      </p>
      <p>
        "'For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
        remain before me,' says Yahweh, 'so your offspring and your name shall
        remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one
        Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,' says
        Yahweh. 'They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who
        have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will
        their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind'"
        (Isaiah 66:22-24).
      </p>
      <p>
        "'For behold, the day comes, burning like a furnace, when all the proud
        and all who work wickedness will be stubble. The day that comes will
        burn them up,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'so that it will leave them
        neither root nor branch. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of
        righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out and leap
        like calves of the stall. You shall tread down the wicked; for they will
        be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,' says
        Yahweh of Armies" (Malachi 4:1-3).
      </p>
      <p>
        "When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more; but the righteous
        stand firm forever... The fear of Yahweh prolongs days, but the years of
        the wicked shall be shortened... The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to
        the upright, but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. The
        righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in the
        land. The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom, but the perverse
        tongue will be cut off" (Proverbs 10:25, 27, 29-31).
      </p>
      <p>
        "If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away
        from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members
        should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna" (Matthew
        5:29). "Enter in by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is
        broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter in by it.
        How narrow is the gate and the way is restricted that leads to life!
        There are few who find it" (Matthew 7:13-14).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill
        the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
        Gehenna" (Matthew 10:28). "I tell you, my friends, don’t be afraid of
        those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
        But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him who after he has
        killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him" (Luke
        12:4-5).
      </p>
      <p>
        "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that
        whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life" (John
        3:16). "My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow
        me. And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish forever,
        and no one will seize them out of my hand" (John 10:27-28, LEB). "Jesus
        said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes
        in me, even if he dies, will live, and everyone who lives and believes
        in me will never die forever'" (John 11:25-26, LEB). "These will go away
        into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Matthew
        25:46). "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
        eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy" (James
        4:12). "Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth and someone
        turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error
        of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of
        sins" (James 5:19-20).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evildoers
        flourish, they will be destroyed forever" (Psalm 92:7). "Who will pay
        the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the
        glory of his might, when he comes in that day to be glorified in his
        saints and to be admired among all those who have believed, because our
        testimony to you was believed" (2 Thess 1:9-10).
      </p>
      <p>
        "For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the
        truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful
        expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the
        adversaries" (Hebrews 10:26-27). "But for the cowardly, unbelieving,
        sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters,
        and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and
        sulfur, which is the second death." (Revelation 21:8).
