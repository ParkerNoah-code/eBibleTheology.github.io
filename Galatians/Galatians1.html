      <h1>Galatians</h1>
      <p>
        John Gill on Galatians 1:1-12: "This chapter contains the inscription of
        the epistle, the apostle's usual salutation of the persons he writes to,
        and the charge he brought against them for their fickleness and
        inconstancy, in showing any manner of disposition towards a removal from
        the Gospel; the truth, certainty, and authority of the Gospel, and an
        account of himself, who was a preacher of it; of his life before
        conversion; of the nature and manner of his conversion; of his travels,
        labours, and usefulness afterwards."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The inscription is in Ga 1:1,2 in which the writer of the epistle is
        described by his name Paul, and by his office, an apostle; which office
        he had not of men, but of God, of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and of
        God the Father, who is described by his power in raising Christ from the
        dead. The persons to whom the epistle is inscribed are the churches of
        Galatia, and those that joined the apostle in the salutation of them
        were the brethren that were with him."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The salutation follows, Ga 1:3 in which mention being made of Christ,
        there is a declaration of a singular benefit by him, which contains the
        sum of the Gospel, as that he gave himself for the sins of his people,
        to deliver them from the present evil world, according to the will of
        God, Ga 1:4 upon which a doxology, or an ascription of glory is made,
        either to Christ, who gave himself, or to the Father, according to whose
        will he did, or to both, Ga 1:5."
      </p>
      <p>
        "After which the apostle proceeds to exhibit a charge of levity against
        the Galatians; and which he expresses in a way of admiration, that they
        should so soon be carried away from the doctrine of grace, to another
        doctrine the reverse of it, Ga 1:6 though he somewhat mitigates this
        reproof by laying the blame on the false teachers, who were troublers of
        them, and perverters of the Gospel of Christ; and corrects himself for
        calling their false doctrine by the name of another Gospel, Ga 1:7 and
        delivers out, and pronounces an anathema on all such, whether angels or
        men, that should preach any other Gospel than he had preached, and they
        had received, Ga 1:8,9. "
      </p>
      <p>
        "The excellency of which Gospel is set forth, by the matter of it, being
        not human but divine, and by the manner of preaching it, with all
        simplicity and honesty, not seeking to please men, Ga 1:10 and from the
        efficient cause of it, it being denied to be after man, or received
        from, or taught by man, but is ascribed to the revelation of Christ
        Jesus, Ga 1:11,12."
