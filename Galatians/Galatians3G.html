        Augustine writes, "Now it was quite competent for the apostle to say,
        and to say rightly: 'Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ;' but he
        could never say: Be justified by me, as I also am by Christ;— since
        there may be, and indeed actually are and have been, many who were
        righteous and worthy of imitation; but no one is righteous and a
        justifier but Christ alone. Whence it is said: 'To the man that believes
        in him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for
        righteousness' [ Romans 4:5 ]... But it has never been in the power of
        any of the saints of God to say this except the Saint of saints, who
        said:
        <em>You believe in God, believe also in me</em> [John 14:1]; so that,
        inasmuch as it is He that justifies the ungodly, to the man who believes
        in him that justifies the ungodly his faith is imputed for
        righteousness." (<a

        Tertullian writes, "One man perverts the Scriptures with his hand,
        another their meaning by his exposition. For although Valentinus seems
        to use the entire volume, he has none the less laid violent hands on the
        truth only with a more cunning mind and skill than Marcion. Marcion
        expressly and openly used the knife, not the pen, since he made such an
        excision of the Scriptures as suited his own subject-matter. Valentinus,
        however, abstained from such excision, because he did not invent
        Scriptures to square with his own subject-matter, but adapted his matter
        to the Scriptures; and yet he took away more, and added more, by
        removing the proper meaning of every particular word, and adding
        fantastic arrangements of things which have no real existence." (<a

        J. C. Ryle comments, "We all know the habit of mind that makes men great
        in this world,—that makes such men as Alexander the Great, or Julius
        Caesar, or Oliver Cromwell, or Peter the Great, or Charles XII., or
        Marlborough, or Napoleon, or Pitt. We know that, with all their faults,
        they were all men of one thing. They threw themselves into one grand
        pursuit. They cared for nothing else. They put every thing else aside.
        They counted everything else as second-rate, and of subordinate
        importance, compared to the one thing that they put before their eyes
        every day they lived. I say that the same habit of mind applied to the
        service of the Lord Jesus Christ becomes religious zeal." (<a
