        Cyril of Jerusalem writes, "Vice mimics virtue, and the tares strive to
        be thought wheat, growing like the wheat in appearance, but being
        detected by good judges from the taste... We have need therefore of
        divine grace, and of a sober mind, and of eyes that see, lest from
        eating tares as wheat we suffer harm from ignorance, and lest from
        taking the wolf to be a sheep we become his prey... for, as the
        Scripture says,
        <em>he goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour</em>...
        The Greeks on the one hand draw men away by their smooth tongue,
        <em>for honey drops from a harlot's lips</em> whereas they of the
        Circumcision deceive those who come to them by means of the Divine
        Scriptures, which they miserably misinterpret though studying them from
        childhood to old age, and growing old in ignorance. But the children of
        heretics, by their good words and smooth tongue, deceive the hearts of
        the innocent, disguising with the name of Christ as it were with honey
        the poisoned arrows of their impious doctrines: concerning all of whom
        together the Lord says, <em>Take heed lest any man mislead you</em>."

        Hippolytus writes, "There is, brethren, one God, the knowledge of whom
        we gain from the Holy Scriptures, and from no other source. For just as
        a man, if he wishes to be skilled in the wisdom of this world, will find
        himself unable to get at it in any other way than by mastering the
        dogmas of philosophers, so all of us who wish to practise piety will be
        unable to learn its practice from any other quarter than the oracles of
        God. Whatever things, then, the Holy Scriptures declare, at these let us
        took; and whatsoever things they teach, these let us learn; and as the
        Father wills our belief to be, let us believe; and as He wills the Son
        to be glorified, let us glorify Him; and as He wills the Holy Spirit to
        be bestowed, let us receive Him. Not according to our own will, nor
        according to our own mind, nor yet as using violently those things which
        are given by God, but even as He has chosen to teach them by the Holy
        Scriptures, so let us discern them." (<a

        Lactantius writes, "For since all error arises either from false
        religion or from wisdom, in refuting error it is necessary to overthrow
        both. For inasmuch as it has been handed down to us in the sacred
        writings that the thoughts of philosophers are foolish, this very thing
        is to be proved by fact and by arguments, that no one, induced by the
        honourable name of wisdom, or deceived by the splendour of empty
        eloquence, may prefer to give credence to human rather than to divine
        things. Which things, indeed, are related in a concise and simple
        manner. For it was not befitting that, when God was speaking to man, He
        should confirm His words by arguments, as though He would not otherwise
        be regarded with confidence: but, as it was right, He spoke as the
        mighty Judge of all things, to whom it belongs not to argue, but to
        pronounce sentence. He Himself, as God, is truth. But we, since we have
        divine testimony for everything, will assuredly show by how much surer
        arguments truth may be defended, when even false things are so defended
        that they are accustomed to appear true. Wherefore there is no reason
        why we should give so much honour to philosophers as to fear their
        eloquence. For they might speak well as men of learning; but they could
        not speak truly, because they had not learned the truth from Him in
        whose power it was." (<a

        Gregory of Nyssa writes, "Now they charge us with innovation, and frame
        their complaint against us in this way:— They allege that while we
        confess three Persons we say that there is one goodness, and one power,
        and one Godhead... But the ground of their complaint is that their
        custom does not admit this, and Scripture does not support it. What then
        is our reply? We do not think that it is right to make their prevailing
        custom the law and rule of sound doctrine. For if custom is to avail for
        proof of soundness, we too, surely, may advance our prevailing custom;
        and if they reject this, we are surely not bound to follow theirs. Let
        the inspired Scripture, then, be our umpire, and the vote of truth will
        surely be given to those whose dogmas are found to agree with the Divine
        words." (<a

        Thomas Aquinas, answering whether it must be said that the three persons
        are of one essence, raises and responds to an objection: "Objection 2.
        Further, nothing is to be affirmed of God except what can be confirmed
        by the authority of Holy Writ, as appears from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i).
        Now Holy Writ never says that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are of one
        essence. Therefore this should not be asserted.
        <br />
        Reply to Objection 2. Although we may not find it declared in Holy Writ
        in so many words that the three persons are of one essence, nevertheless
        we find it so stated as regards the meaning; for instance, 'I and the
        Father are one (John 10:30),' and 'I am in the Father, and the Father in
        Me (John 10:38)'; and there are many other texts of the same import."

        John Calvin writes, "Paul testifies that the Church is 'built on the
        foundation of the apostles and prophets,' (Eph. 2:20). If the doctrine
        of the apostles and prophets is the foundation of the Church, the former
        must have had its certainty before the latter began to exist... How
        shall we be persuaded that it came from God without recurring to a
        decree of the Church? it is just the same as if it were asked, How shall
        we learn to distinguish light from darkness, white from black, sweet
        from bitter? Scripture bears upon the face of it as clear evidence of
        its truth, as white and black do of their colour, sweet and bitter of
        their taste." (<a

        Thomas Schreiner comments, "In seeing Jesus Christ he was also called to

        authoritative messenger of the crucified and risen Lord." (Galatians,

        Theodoret writes, "Even the great teacher of the world who is wont to
        style himself last of saints and first of sinners, that he might stop
        the mouths of liars was compelled to set forth a list of his own
        labours; and in showing that this account of his sufferings was of
        necessity, not of free will, he added I have become a fool in glorying;
        you have compelled me. I own myself wretched — aye thrice wretched. I am
        guilty of many errors. Through faith alone I look for finding some mercy
        in the day of the Lord's appearing." (<a

        Dionysius of Alexandria writes, "And we abstained from defending in
        every manner and contentiously the opinions which we had once held,
        unless they appeared to be correct. Nor did we evade objections, but we
        endeavored as far as possible to hold to and confirm the things which
        lay before us, and if the reason given satisfied us, we were not ashamed
        to change our opinions and agree with others; but on the contrary,
        conscientiously and sincerely, and with hearts laid open before God, we
        accepted whatever was established by the proofs and teachings of the
        Holy Scriptures." (cited from Eusebius,
        <a

        Anselm of Canterbury writes, "For if at times we assert by a process of
        reasoning a conclusion which we cannot explicitly cite from the sayings
        of Scripture or demonstrate from the bare wording, still it is by using
        Scripture that we know in the following way whether the affirmation
        should be accepted or rejected. If the conclusion is reached by
        straightforward reasoning and Scripture in no way contradicts it, then
        by the very fact that it does not deny what is inferred on the basis of
        reason, that conclusion is accepted as authorized by Scripture. But if
        Scripture indubitably opposes our understanding, even though our
        reasoning appears to us to be impregnable, still it ought not to be
        believed to be substantiated by any truth at all. It is when Sacred
        Scripture either clearly affirms or in no wise denies it, that it gives
        support to the authority of any reasoned conclusion." (<a
