      <h1>Galatians</h1>
      <p>
        John Gill on Galatians 1:10-2:21: "The excellency of which Gospel is set
        forth, by the matter of it, being not human but divine, and by the
        manner of preaching it, with all simplicity and honesty, not seeking to
        please men, Ga 1:10 and from the efficient cause of it, it being denied
        to be after man, or received from, or taught by man, but is ascribed to
        the revelation of Christ Jesus, Ga 1:11,12."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And that the apostle had it not from men, he proves by the account of
        himself, and his conversation before conversion, as how that he had been
        a persecutor of the church of God, of those that professed the Christian
        religion and doctrine; wherefore he could not have the Gospel, as not
        from nature and education, so not from the chief priests, Scribes, and
        elders, who encouraged him to persecute, Ga 1:13."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And this he further makes to appear by his great proficiency in the
        religion of the Jews, and his abundant zeal for the traditions of the
        fathers, which set him at the greatest distance from, and opposition to,
        the Gospel of Christ, Ga 1:14. And, on the other hand, that he received
        it of God, and by the revelation of Christ, he proves by the account he
        gives of his effectual calling and conversion; the source and spring of
        which was the sovereign will of God in divine predestination, and the
        moving cause of it, the free grace of God, Ga 1:15."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The manner in which this was done was by a revelation of Christ in him;
        and the end of it was, that he might preach Christ to the Gentiles,
        which he immediately did, without consulting flesh and blood, Ga 1:16."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And as it was a clear point that he could never receive the Gospel from
        the Jews before his conversion, he and they being enemies to it, and
        persecutors of it; so it was evident that he did not receive it, after
        his conversion, even from Christian men, seeing he did not, upon his
        conversion, go directly to Jerusalem, and confer with the apostles
        there, who were the most likely persons to have taught him the Gospel;
        but instead of this he went into Arabia preaching the Gospel, and then
        came back to Damascus, where he was converted, Ga 1:17."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And it was three years after his conversion, that he went to Jerusalem
        to visit Peter; and his stay with him was very short, no longer than
        fifteen days; and he was the only apostle he saw there, excepting James,
        the brother of Christ, Ga 1:18,19 for the truth of all which he appeals
        to God the searcher of hearts, Ga 1:20."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And then goes on with the account of himself, and his travels; how that
        when he departed from Jerusalem, he did not go into any other parts of
        Judea, and visit the churches there, but went into the countries of
        Syria and Cilicia; and was not so much as known by thee, or personally,
        by any of the churches, or members of the churches in Judea, Ga 1:20,21
        so that as it could not be thought by his short stay at Jerusalem, and
        the few apostles he saw there, that he received the Gospel he preached
        from them, so neither from any other ministers, or body of Christians in
        the land of Judea; for all they knew of him was by hearsay only, as that
        he who was formerly a persecutor of them, was now become a preacher of
        the Gospel he had sought to destroy, Ga 1:22,23 wherefore it was a clear
        case he had not received the Gospel from them."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Besides, as they had heard that he preached the Gospel of Christ, they
        glorified God for it, who had revealed it to him, and bestowed gifts
        upon him, fitting him for such service, Ga 1:24."
      </p>
      <p>
        "In this chapter the apostle proceeds with the narrative of himself, and
        gives an account of another journey of his to Jerusalem, where he had a
        conversation with the chief of the apostles; in which they approved of
        his ministry, allowed of his commission, and took him into fellowship
        with them, but gave him no new instructions, nor added to his spiritual
        light and knowledge; from whence it appeared that the Gospel he preached
        was not after men, or received from men, as he had asserted in the
        preceding chapter; and he also gives an account of his meeting with
        Peter at Antioch, and how he reproved him for some judaizing practices;
        which leads him to assert the doctrine of justification by faith, in
        opposition to the works of the law; which is the grand point he had in
        view to establish in this epistle, and which he vindicates from the
        charge of licentiousness."
      </p>
      <p>
        "He begins with an account of another journey of his to Jerusalem, the
        circumstances of which he relates, as the time when, fourteen years ago;
        the persons he took with him as his companions, Barnabas and Titus, Ga
        2:1 what moved him to it, a revelation from God; and the business he did
        when come thither, he communicated the Gospel, and that not to any but
        to such that were of reputation, and not publicly but privately;"
      </p>
      <p>
        "his end was, that it might appear how successful he had been in his
        ministry, and had not laboured in vain, Ga 2:2 then follows a narrative
        of a particular event relating to Titus, who is described as one of his
        companions, and by his nation, a Greek; and who though an uncircumcised
        person, yet the apostles and elders at Jerusalem did not oblige him to
        be circumcised, which showed that they were of the same mind with the
        apostle in this point, Ga 2:3 and the reason of it was because of the
        false teachers, that they might not give them any handle; who are
        described by their character, false brethren, by their private manner of
        getting in among the saints, and by their ends and views, which were to
        spy out their Christian liberty and bring them into bondage, Ga 2:4 to
        whom the apostle opposed himself, and would not give way for the least
        space of time;"
      </p>
      <p>
        "for this end, that the truth of the Gospel might continue with the
        Gentiles, Ga 2:5 and as for the apostles, though they were men of great
        character and reputation, nor would the apostle detract from it; yet
        they added nothing to him, he received nothing from them, Ga 2:6 but, on
        the other hand, partly because they saw that as the Gospel to be
        preached to the Jews was committed to Peter, so the same Gospel to be
        preached to the Gentiles was committed to Paul; and partly because of
        the same efficacy and success in the ministry of the one as in the
        ministry of the other; as also because they perceived what gifts of
        grace were bestowed on the apostle;"
      </p>
      <p>
        "they gave to him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, as a token
        of their mutual agreement, and as being of the same society, Ga 2:7-9
        nor did they give him and Barnabas anything in charge, but only to
        remember the poor, to which he was forward enough of himself, Ga 2:10
        after which follows an account of an opposition made by the apostle to
        Peter, which was done at Antioch, and to his face, and not without
        reason, Ga 2:11 for whereas some time before he ate with the Gentiles,
        which was commendable in him, he afterwards declined conversation with
        them, moved to it by fear of the converted Jews, Ga 2:12 and such was
        the force of his example, that other Jews, who before did not scruple
        eating with the Gentiles, separated likewise, and even Barnabas himself,
        Paul's companion, Ga 2:13 wherefore seeing this was not walking
        according to the Gospel of Christ, and with that integrity and
        uprightness which became such persons, the apostle publicly reproved
        Peter, and expostulated with him;"
      </p>
      <p>
        "partly on account of his former conversation with the Gentiles, though
        he himself was a Jew, and therefore it was absurd and contradictory in
        him to oblige the Gentiles to live as the Jews did, Ga 2:14 and partly
        on account of the ledge which he and Peter and others who were Jews, and
        not sinners of the Gentiles, had of the doctrine of justification; that
        it was not by the works of the law, but by faith in Christ;"
      </p>
      <p>
        "for to this end they had believed in Christ that they might be
        justified, not by the one, but by the other; which doctrine is confirmed
        by a passage referred to in Ps 149:2, Ga 2:5,16 and whereas it might be
        objected that this doctrine of free justification opened a door to
        licentiousness, the apostle answers to it by an abhorrence of it, Ga
        2:17 and by observing that this would build up what he had destroyed, Ga
        2:18 besides, he argues the contrary from his being dead to the law,
        that he might live unto God, Ga 2:19 and from his crucifixion with
        Christ, and of the old man with his deeds; and from Christ's living in
        him, and his living by faith upon him, Ga 2:20 and for the further
        confirmation of the doctrine of justification being by faith, and not by
        works, he suggests, were it otherwise, both the grace of God would be
        frustrated and made void, and the death of Christ be in vain, Ga 2:21."
