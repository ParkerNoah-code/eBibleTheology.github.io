        See <a href="Commentary.html">Commentary</a> for a detailed look at the
        text.
      </p>
      <h3>Author and Date</h3>
      <p>
        The author of John's Gospel is clearly the apostle John; however, there
        has been some confusion on the authorship of the letters of John and
        John's Book of Revelation since the time of Eusebius, an early church
        bishop and historian.
      </p>
      <p>
        The confusion came early on from what appears to be a misinterpretation
        of Papias' words by Eusebius. Papias calls John the "disciple of the
        Lord" and an "elder" which Eusebius takes as meaning two separate Johns
        (Eusebius,
        <a

          target="_blank"
          ><em>Church History</em></a
        >, 3.39.5-6).
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, it appears that he used the terms interchangably, and since the
        setting, name, writing style, and apostolic testimony all strongly
        suggest the same author, it is most likely that the apostle John wrote
        the Gospel, epistles, and Book of Revelation.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience, Occasion, and Background</h3>
      <p>
        The “chosen lady and her children” to whom this letter is addressed most
        likely refers to a local congregation and its members (see Commentary
        for explanation). John writes to respond to false teachings because
        "many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess
        that Jesus Christ came in the flesh." John may have been responding to
        early Gnostic thought that emerged in the late first century AD. The
        Gnostics taught that the spiritual realm was good but that the material
        realm was bad and therefore denied the incarnation and humanity of
        Jesus. There was also pressure to compromise from the synagogues and
        from their culture with pagan thought and values.
      </p>
      <h3>Purpose and Message</h3>
      <p>
        John emphasizes and embodies the kind of love that he urges them to walk
        in. He stresses the active nature of that love, "that we should walk
        according to his commandments." A love that is in accordance with "the
        truth," that is Jesus Christ. He draws out an implication from this that
        addresses their situation and directly applies to us today: as
        Christians, we must resist and reject false teachings and false teachers
        out of a commitment to live in accordance with Christ "in truth and
        love."
      </p>

      <h3>Key Themes</h3>
      <p>
        Love: John addresses them in love and urges them to obey the commandment
        that they had from the beginning, that they "love one another." When
        asked which was the greatest commandment, Jesus quoted, "<em
          >You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all you
          soul, and with all you mind</em
        >" (Mat 22:37 // Deut 6:5) and "<em
          >You shall love your neighbor as yourself</em
        >" (Mat 22:39 // Lev 19:18). Love is a defining characteristic of a true
        Christian community because love is a defining characteristic of God:
        "<em>God is love</em>" (1 Jn 4:16). Christ's self-sacrifical love is
        typified at the cross, and he challenges us to follow his example
        saying, "<em
          >If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his
          cross, and follow me</em
        >" (Mat 16:24; See also Phil 2:5-11).
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth: John emphasizes the importance of truth and holding on to the
        sure "teaching of Christ." Believing and living according to the truth
        brings real freedom, joy, and peace. Therefore, our faith, far from
        being unreasonable and untrue, accords with the truth. Paul demonstrates
        the seriousness of this conviction when he says, "<em
          >If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in
          your sins. Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have
          perished. If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all
          men most pitiable</em
        >" (1 Cor 15:17-18), but we can confidently come to Jesus knowing that
        Jesus is "<em>the way, the truth, and the life</em>" (Jn 14:6) because
        "<em
          >If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples. You will
          know the truth, and the truth will make you free</em
        >" (John 8:31-32; See also 1 Jn 1:8; 5:20; Prov 30:5; Eph 4:15).
      </p>
      <p>
        Walking in truth: Although it is vital that we hold on to what is true,
        that truth should be allowed to change our hearts to reflect Jesus so
        that we "walk in truth." Paul demonstrates this pattern of knowing the
        truth and then walking in it: "<em
          >Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are
          honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure,
          whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report: if
          there is any virtue and if there is anything worthy of praise, think
          about these things. Do the things which you learned, received, heard,
          and saw in me, and the God of peace will be with you</em
        >" (Phil 4:8-9).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Father and the Son: Despite this letter being less theologically
        focused, it is apparent that John's thinking is thoroughly entrenched
        with a Trinitarian view of God (vv. 3, 7-9; See also Jn 1:1).
