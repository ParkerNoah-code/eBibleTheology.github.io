      <h1>Gospel Centrality</h1>
      <h2>A. Evangelism Must Be Gospel-Centered</h2>
      <p><b>Romans 1:16</b></p>
      <p>
        "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of
        God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also
        for the Greek."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul emphasizes that the gospel is the power of God for salvation.
        Evangelism must focus on proclaiming this message, as it is not human
        effort or eloquence that saves.
      </p>
      <p><b>1 Corinthians 15:1-4</b></p>
      <p>
        "Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to
        you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you
        are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you
        believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also
        received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and
        that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to
        the Scriptures."
      </p>
      <p>
        The gospel is not just one aspect of the Christian message; it is of
        "first importance." Paul defines the gospel as the life, death, and
        resurrection of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins according to
        the Scriptures. Evangelism must center on this message, as it is the
        foundation of salvation.
      </p>
      <h2>B. Human Wisdom is Not a Solid Foundation</h2>
      <p><b>1 Corinthians 2:1-2</b></p>
      <p>
        "And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of
        speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. For I
        determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him
        crucified."
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul makes it clear that evangelism is not about persuasive speech,
        worldly wisdom, or clever arguments.
      </p>
      <p><b>1 Corinthians 2:4-5</b></p>
      <p>
        "And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human
        wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith
        should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        True faith does not come from human persuasion but from the power of
        God. Evangelism must rely on the work of the Holy Spirit rather than
        manipulation or rhetorical skills. If people are convinced merely by
        human reasoning, their faith will be weak, but if they come to Christ
        through the Spirit’s power, their faith will be genuine and enduring.
      </p>
      <h2>C. The Role of Scripture in Evangelism</h2>
      <p><b>2 Timothy 3:15</b></p>
      <p>
        "And that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are
        able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ
        Jesus."
      </p>
      <p>
        Scripture is essential in evangelism because it reveals the way of
        salvation. The Bible contains the truth about Christ, and through it,
        people are led to faith. Evangelism must be rooted in God's Word rather
        than personal experiences or opinions.
      </p>
      <p><b>Isaiah 55:11</b></p>
      <p>
        "So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return
        to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper
        in the thing for which I sent it."
      </p>
      <p>
        God’s Word is powerful and effective. When the gospel is preached, it
        will accomplish God's purposes, whether that results in repentance and
        salvation or in judgment. Evangelists can be confident that Scripture
        will work in the hearts of those who hear it.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hebrews 4:12</b></p>
      <p>
        "For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any
        two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and
        of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of
        the heart."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bible is not just words on a page; it is alive and active, cutting
        through human resistance and convicting people of their sin. Evangelism
        must depend on the power of Scripture to bring about true spiritual
        transformation in the hearts of unbelievers.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Evangelism must always be centered on the gospel, not human wisdom or
        persuasive techniques. The role of Scripture is crucial in this task, as
        it brings wisdom, conviction, and life. Faithful evangelism relies on
        God's Word and the Spirit’s power, trusting that He will accomplish His
        work through the proclamation of the gospel.
