      <h1>James 2:14-26</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        James 2:14-26 has long been a focal point of theological discussion,
        particularly concerning the relationship between faith and works. James
        2:18 is of particular interest for interpreting the passage correctly. I
        believe that the verse is best understood as an indirect quote rather
        than a direct quote. This resolves the apparent tensions in the argument
        and makes the meaning very clear through the passage. I’m using the ESV
        except James 2:18 is translated as an indirect quote rather than a
        direct quotation.
      </p>
      <h2>Passage</h2>
      <p>
        <sup>14</sup> What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith
        but does not have works? Can that faith save him? <sup>15</sup> If a
        brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
        <sup>16</sup> and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and
        filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good
        is that? <sup>17</sup> So also faith by itself, if it does not have
        works, is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>18</sup> But someone will say that you have faith and I have works.
        Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith
        by my works. <sup>19</sup> You believe that God is one; you do well.
        Even the demons believe—and shudder! <sup>20</sup> Do you want to be
        shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?
        <sup>21</sup> Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he
        offered up his son Isaac on the altar? <sup>22</sup> You see that faith
        was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;
        <sup>23</sup> and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham
        believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was
        called a friend of God. <sup>24</sup> You see that a person is justified
        by works and not by faith alone. <sup>25</sup> And in the same way was
        not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the
        messengers and sent them out by another way? <sup>26</sup> For as the
        body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is
        dead.

      <h2>Commentary</h2>
      <p>
        <em
          >What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does
          not have works? Can that faith save him?</em
        >
        — James is challenging the view that somebody can have faith without
        works with two rhetorical questions. The first objection is that it
        doesn’t do any good. The second objection is that the kind of faith that
        doesn’t produce good works is not the kind of faith that saves. It
        presupposes justification by faith alone, but clarifies that saving
        faith produces good works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
          and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,”
          without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is
          that?</em
        >
        — He supports the first objection that the kind of faith he described is
        useless with an example. If you merely profess faith, it does no good.
        If you merely profess helping people without helping them, it does no
        good.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</em> —
        His conclusion is this: if your faith remains alone, it is a dead thing.
        It is not life producing or life giving. It produces death and leads to
        death. There is a living and active faith that leads to life and there
        is a dead and inactive faith that leads to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >But someone will say that you [hypothetical objector] have faith and
          I [James] have works.</em
        >
        — James introduces a hypothetical objector. The objector says in effect,
        “But James, you told me that I am saved by faith alone. It is true that
        my faith isn’t producing good works and that your faith is, but that is
        fine because I am still saved.” James refutes this objector in the
        following verses by proving that saving faith necessarily produces good
        works. One knows that they have saving faith based on the good works
        that follow in their life. Likewise, one knows they have a dead faith
        based on the lack of good works in their life. A good tree produces good
        fruit, while a bad tree produces bad fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my
          faith by my works.</em
        >
        — Now the focus shifts to the perspective of knowing that a person has
        saving faith. How do I even know that you have faith in the first place
        if you don’t have works hypothetical objector? Can they literally show
        me their invisible faith? The obvious answer is no. But James says he
        has a way to show his faith, and that is by his works. Your faith will
        be evident to others by the way that you live.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and
          shudder!</em
        >
        — This objection applies to people who would think that faith could mean
        merely believing certain truths or that true faith could exist without
        producing fruit. Obviously the demons believe in God in a certain sense.
        They know that God exists and know certain things about Him. One could
        believe that Jesus rose from the dead and other various Christian
        doctrines but not have saving faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes saving faith different than the kind of faith demons possess?
        Saving faith includes not just believing intellectually but trusting
        from the heart and results in a transformed life which produces good
        works. Saving faith cannot be confused with good works as if we do
        anything to earn our salvation, but it cannot be separated from good
        works either as if the Holy Spirit is not continuing to sanctify us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from
          works is useless?</em
        >
        — Dead faith, a faith without works, is completely useless in that it
        produces dead works and leads to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his
          son Isaac on the altar?</em
        >
        — Leading up to this we see that the hypothetical objector has no works
        which is evidence of his dead faith while James has works which is
        evidence of his living faith. Now he provides the example of Abraham.
        How do we know that Abraham had saving faith? How is Abraham shown to be
        saved, vindicated, and justified? Well, he obeyed and trusted God to the
        point that he was willing to give up his beloved son Isaac.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word justification simply means vindication. As a theological term,
        it is usually used the way Paul uses it: a legal declaration of
        righteousness before God by grace through faith apart from works. James
        uses the word in reference to outward vindication or proof of
        righteousness: one is justified, that is shown to have genuine saving
        faith and salvation, by works. Paul answers the question of how one is
        able to be made right with God, that is by faith, while James answers
        the question of how one is shown to be right before God, that is by
        works which are evidence of faith. Both uses of the word justification
        are complementary, not contradictory, and James’ explanation of
        justification before men presupposes Paul’s explanation of justification
        before God.

      <p>
        <em
          >You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was
          completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says,
          “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and
          he was called a friend of God.</em
        >
        — Abraham was counted righteous by faith before he was circumcised,
        before he offered up Isaac, and before the giving of the law. It was by
        faith that he was made righteous before God. But that is not the end of
        the story. His faith led him to good works, the key example being the
        offering up Isaac, which demonstrated his faith and salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith
          alone.</em
        >
        — It is only by works, the tangible result of faith, that one can
        demonstrate the intangible faith that led to those works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by
          works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another
          way?</em
        >
        — The example of Rahab follows the same pattern as Abraham. She had
        faith and her faith led to works which demonstrated her faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rahab’s faith led to her helping the spies: “I know that the Lord has
        given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and
        that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. For we have
        heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you
        came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who
        were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to
        destruction. And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there
        was no spirit left in any man because of you, for the Lord your God, he
        is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath” (Joshua 2:9-11).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart
          from works is dead.</em
        >
        — Just as a body without a spirit is just a dead body, so faith without
        any works is just a dead faith. “Can that faith save him?” No! Saving
        faith produces good works, and good works demonstrate saving faith.
