      <h1>Justification</h1>
      <h2>Old Testament Background</h2>
      <h3>Hebrew Terms</h3>
      <p>
        The primary Hebrew root that conveys the idea of justification is צָדַק
        (tsadaq), which means "to be righteous" or "to declare righteous."
        Several related words expand upon this concept:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          צֶדֶק (tsedeq) – Righteousness or justice, often used to describe
          God's just nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          צְדָקָה (tsedaqah) – Righteousness or justification, often associated
          with divine justice and human moral conduct.
        </li>
        <li>
          מִשְׁפָּט (mishpat) – Judgment or justice, frequently appearing in
          legal and covenantal contexts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These terms are used in judicial settings, where a person can be either
        justified (declared righteous) or condemned (declared guilty).
      </p>
      <h3>Legal and Judicial Contexts</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most significant aspects of justification in the Old
        Testament is its connection to legal proceedings. This forensic aspect
        is evident in passages that discuss courtroom settings, where a judge
        pronounces a verdict:
      </p>
      <p>
        Deuteronomy 25:1 – "If there is a dispute between men and they come into
        court, and the judges decide between them, acquitting (justifying) the
        innocent and condemning the guilty."
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage clearly illustrates that justification is a judicial
        declaration rather than an inherent moral state. A judge declares
        someone righteous not because of their personal virtue but because the
        legal system recognizes their innocence or absolves them of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proverbs 17:15 – "He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the
        righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD."
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, justification is depicted in contrast with condemnation.
        Justification is proper when it aligns with truth and justice; however,
        when the wicked are justified (i.e., declared righteous without cause),
        it is considered detestable to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isaiah 5:23 – "Who acquit (justify) the guilty for a bribe, and deprive
        the innocent of his right!"
      </p>
      <p>
        This passage emphasizes the perversion of justice when justification is
        granted improperly. These passages reinforce the legal framework of
        justification, demonstrating that it is a status declared by an
        authority, rather than an internal transformation.
      </p>
      <h3>Justification and Covenant</h3>
      <p>
        While the legal aspect of justification is crucial, it is also deeply
        connected to God’s covenant with Israel. The Old Testament consistently
        portrays God as the just and righteous King who maintains a covenantal
        relationship with His people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Genesis 15:6 – "And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as
        righteousness."
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse is foundational to the concept of justification by faith.
        Abraham was not justified by his works but by his faith in God's
        promises. Paul later uses this verse in Romans 4:1-5 to argue that
        justification is by faith apart from works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isaiah 53:11 – "By his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,
        make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their
        iniquities."
      </p>
      <p>
        This messianic prophecy foreshadows how justification will ultimately
        come through the atoning work of the Suffering Servant (Jesus Christ).
        The idea of substitutionary atonement is present here: the righteous one
        bears the sins of others so that they may be justified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Psalm 143:2 – "Enter not into judgment with your servant, for no one
        living is righteous before you."
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse acknowledges that no one can be justified before God based on
        their own righteousness. Justification must come through divine grace
        rather than human effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, justification in the Old Testament is tied to God’s covenant
        faithfulness. Israel was expected to walk in obedience, but their
        justification ultimately depended on God's mercy and His provision of
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <h3>Justification and Atonement</h3>
      <p>
        The sacrificial system in the Old Testament also plays a critical role
        in understanding justification. Since humanity is inherently sinful
        (Psalm 51:5, Ecclesiastes 7:20), God provided a means by which sins
        could be atoned for, allowing justification to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leviticus 17:11 – "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have
        given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls."
      </p>
      <p>
        The sacrificial system demonstrates that justification requires
        atonement. Blood sacrifices served as a means of covering sin and
        enabling righteousness before God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exodus 34:6-7 – "The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow
        to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping
        steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and
        sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty."
      </p>
      <p>
        God is just and cannot ignore sin. Justification must be based on both
        God’s mercy and His justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sacrificial system, though temporary, pointed forward to a greater
        atonement, which would provide final, salvific justification for the
        life to come (Hebrews 10:1-4). This is ultimately fulfilled in Christ’s
        atoning death.
      </p>
      <h3>The Prophetic Hope</h3>
      <p>
        The Old Testament prophets frequently anticipated a time when this true
        justification would be fully realized:
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremiah 23:6 – "In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell
        securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The LORD is
        our righteousness.’"
      </p>
      <p>The future Messiah will bring righteousness and justification.</p>
      <p>Habakkuk 2:4 – "The righteous shall live by his faith."</p>
      <p>
        This verse, later quoted by Paul in Romans 1:17 and Galatians 3:11,
        emphasizes that righteousness (justification) leading to life is
        attained through faith.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The Old Testament presents justification as a legal declaration of
        righteousness, closely associated with God’s justice and covenantal
        faithfulness. It is rooted in forensic language, sacrificial atonement,
        and the necessity of faith. While the Law and sacrifices provided a
        temporary, earthly means of justification, they pointed toward a greater
        fulfillment in the coming Messiah, Jesus Christ. The foundation laid in
        the Old Testament is fully realized in the New Testament doctrine of
        justification by faith, demonstrating the continuity of God's redemptive
        plan throughout history.
      </p>
      <h2>New Testament Background</h2>
      <h3>Greek Terms</h3>
      <p>
        The New Testament employs several Greek words that convey the concept of
        justification. These terms are largely forensic, meaning they are
        related to legal or judicial declarations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Δικαιόω (dikaioō) – "To justify" or "to declare righteous"; used in a
          legal sense rather than an intrinsic moral transformation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosynē) – "Righteousness" or "justice"; often refers
          to the righteousness of God and the righteousness credited to
          believers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Δίκαιος (dikaios) – "Righteous" or "just"; used to describe both God's
          character and the status of those who are justified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Δικαίωσις (dikaiōsis) – "Justification"; a legal acquittal or
          declaration of righteousness.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The forensic nature of these terms aligns with the Old Testament concept
        of justification, confirming that justification is a judicial act rather
        than a process of moral improvement.
      </p>
      <h3>The Gospels</h3>
      <p>
        One of the clearest examples illustrating Jesus' view on justification
        is found in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector in Luke
        18:9-14. In this parable, Jesus intentionally contrasts two starkly
        different approaches to righteousness and standing before God.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pharisee, representative of religious pride and legalistic
        righteousness, confidently boasts of his moral accomplishments,
        meticulously highlighting his fasting and tithing, believing that these
        external actions earn him divine favor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, the tax collector, considered by contemporary Jewish society
        to be among the worst sinners due to his association with Roman
        oppression and corruption, stands at a distance, unable to lift his eyes
        toward heaven, deeply aware of his sinful state. In humility and faith,
        he simply prays, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner" (Luke 18:13).
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus concludes the parable saying, "I tell you, this man [the tax
        collector] went down to his house justified rather than the other" (Luke
        18:14). This parable strongly aligns with Paul's doctrine of
        justification by faith apart from works of the Law (Romans 3:28). Jesus
        reveals that righteousness before God is extended to those who trust
        wholly in God's mercy rather than their own merit.
      </p>
      <h3>Justification in James</h3>
      <p>
        While Paul teaches that justification is by faith alone, James 2:24
        says, "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith
        alone." This is no contradiction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paul speaks of justification before God (a legal declaration).</li>
        <li>
          James speaks of justification before men (evidence of true faith).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have an article exegeting that passage in James in detail:
        <a href="../Articles/JustificationInJames.html"
          >Justification In James</a
        >. Paul himself argues that same point using different language in
        numerous places and affirms that genuine faith produces works:
      </p>
      <p>
        Galatians 5:6 – "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor
        uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through
        love."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ephesians 2:10 – "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
        for good works."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Paul, in full agreement with James, does not dismiss works;
        rather, he teaches that good works follow from a person with saving
        faith and demonstrate the veracity of their faith, but that good works
        are by no means the basis of justification. Justification is through
        faith alone.
      </p>

      <h2>Pauline Justification</h2>
      <h3>Justification in Paul</h3>
      <p>
        The Apostle Paul develops the doctrine of justification most fully,
        especially in Romans, Galatians, and Philippians. His writings emphasize
        that justification is by faith apart from works of the Law, is based on
        Christ’s atoning work, and results in peace with God and freedom from
        condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul’s concept of justification is fundamentally legal and declarative,
        rather than intrinsic or transformative. This means that justification
        is not about making a person morally righteous but about the being
        declared righteous before God. The key Greek term used by Paul is
        δικαιόω (dikaioō), which means “to declare righteous” rather than “to
        make righteous.”
      </p>
      <h3>Forensic Nature</h3>
      <p>
        Paul’s use of δικαιόω (dikaioō) in these contexts confirms that
        justification is a legal pronouncement rather than an internal
        transformation (which is part of sanctification).
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 8:33-34 – "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is
        God who justifies. Who is to condemn?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, justification is depicted as the opposite of condemnation in a
        courtroom setting. Just as a judge pronounces a defendant “not guilty,”
        God declares the believer righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 4:5 – "And to the one who does not work but believes in him who
        justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness."
      </p>
      <p>
        God is said to "justify the ungodly," reinforcing that justification is
        an act of divine grace, not human effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Galatians 2:16 – "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of
        the law but through faith in Jesus Christ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Justification is explicitly contrasted with works of the law, showing
        that righteousness is credited by faith, not earned.
      </p>
      <h3>Faith Alone: Romans 3:21-28</h3>
      <p>
        Romans 3:21 – "But now the righteousness of God has been manifested
        apart from the law."
      </p>
      <p>
        Righteousness comes apart from the law, meaning it is not based on human
        merit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 3:22-23 – "For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and
        fall short of the glory of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        Every person is in need of justification, as all are guilty before God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 3:24-25 – "And are justified by his grace as a gift, through the
        redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
      </p>
      <p>
        Justification is a free gift, based on Christ’s atoning work, not human
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 3:28 – "For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from
        works of the law."
      </p>
      <p>Justification is explicitly by faith, not by works.</p>
      <p>
        Paul reinforces this point in Galatians 2:16, where he states three
        times that justification does not come by the law but by faith in Jesus
        Christ.
      </p>
      <h3>Abraham: Romans 4:1-5</h3>
      <p>
        Paul illustrates justification by faith using Abraham, quoting Genesis
        15:6:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"
        (Romans 4:3).
      </p>
      <p>
        Paul argues that Abraham was justified before circumcision, proving that
        righteousness comes by faith, not by adherence to the law. This means
        that faith has always been the means of justification, even in the Old
        Testament.
      </p>
      <h3>Atonement</h3>
      <p>
        Paul ties justification directly to the atoning work of Jesus Christ.
        Justification is not arbitrary but is based on Christ’s sacrificial
        death, which satisfies God's justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 5:9 – "Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood,
        much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        Justification is possible only through Christ’s death, which serves as
        the basis for righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        2 Corinthians 5:21 – "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no
        sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ bore our sin on the cross, so that by believing in Him we are
        pardoned from our sins and receive His righteousness instead.
      </p>
      <h3>Freedom from Condemnation</h3>
      <p>
        Paul frequently contrasts justification and condemnation, showing that
        justification leads to eternal life, while condemnation leads to
        judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 5:18 – "As one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one
        act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men."
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam’s sin brought condemnation; Christ’s righteousness brings
        justification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 8:1 – "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are
        in Christ Jesus."
      </p>
      <p>
        Justification results in permanent freedom from condemnation.
        Justification is thus final and irreversible—those whom God has
        justified will not be condemned.
      </p>
      <h3>Eschatological Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        While Paul teaches that believers are already justified, he also
        suggests a future aspect of justification:
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 2:13 – "For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous
        before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified."
      </p>
      <p>
        This refers to the final vindication of the justified at the last
        judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Galatians 5:5 – "For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly
        wait for the hope of righteousness."
      </p>
      <p>There is an already-but-not-yet dimension to justification.</p>
      <p>
        This shows that while justification is a present reality, it will be
        fully revealed on the Day of Judgment.
      </p>
      <h2>Doctrine of Justification</h2>
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        Justification is a forensic (legal) act of God in which He declares a
        person righteous based on the righteousness of Christ. It does not refer
        to an internal moral transformation (which is the role of
        sanctification) but to a change in legal status before God.
      </p>
      <p>
        God declares sinners righteous by grace through faith in Christ alone.
        It is based on Christ’s atoning work, received by faith, and results in
        peace with God and eternal security. While good works follow as evidence
        of a transformed life, they are not the cause of justification. This
        doctrine underscores the grace of God, ensuring that salvation is a
        gift, not a reward.
      </p>
      <p>Key aspects about what justification is and is not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Declarative, not Transformative – Justification does not mean that a
          person is made righteous in behavior, but rather that God declares
          them righteous.
        </li>
        <li>
          Imputed, not Earned – The righteousness given in justification is
          imputed (credited to the believer) rather than earned by human effort.
        </li>
        <li>
          By Faith, Not Works – Justification is received through faith alone,
          apart from the works of the Law (Romans 3:28).
        </li>
        <li>
          Based on Christ’s Work – Justification is possible because of Jesus’
          substitutionary atonement and perfect righteousness (2 Corinthians
          5:21).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Basis of Justification</h3>
      <p>
        Justification is not an arbitrary act of God but is based on the
        substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ. Since God is perfectly just,
        He cannot declare sinners righteous without a sufficient basis. The
        atonement provides that basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 5:9 – "Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood,
        much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ’s blood (His death) is the means by which justification is
        secured.

      <p>
        2 Corinthians 5:21 – "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no
        sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the great exchange: Christ takes our sin, and we receive His
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hebrews 9:22 – "Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness
        of sins."
      </p>
      <p>Justification is impossible without Christ’s sacrificial death.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, justification is not based on human effort but on the finished
        work of Christ, whose righteousness is imputed to the believer.
      </p>
      <h3>Means of Justification</h3>
      <p>
        Paul repeatedly emphasizes that justification is received through faith
        alone, apart from works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 5:1 – "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have
        peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
      </p>
      <p>
        Ephesians 2:8-9 – "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and
        this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of
        works, so that no one may boast."
      </p>
      <p>
        Galatians 3:11 – "Now it is evident that no one is justified before God
        by the law, for 'The righteous shall live by faith.'"
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith is not a work but the means by which justification is received. It
        is a trusting reliance on Christ rather than an effort to earn
        righteousness.
      </p>
      <h3>Justification and Works</h3>
      <p>
        While justification is by faith alone, true faith will result in a
        transformed life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ephesians 2:10 – "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
        for good works."
      </p>
      <p>
        Justification is not on the basis of works, but works are the evidence
        of true faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, works do not contribute to justification, but they follow from it
        as proof of a transformed life.
      </p>
      <h3>Assurance and Permanence</h3>
      <p>
        Since justification is based on Christ’s work, it is secure and
        irreversible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 8:1 – "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are
        in Christ Jesus."
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 8:33-34 – "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is
        God who justifies. Who is to condemn?"
      </p>
      <p>
        John 10:28-29 – Jesus promises that no one can snatch believers from His
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Justification is once for all time and permanent, as it is based on
        Christ’s righteousness, not human effort.
