      <h2>Beginning Greek</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="Notes.html">Notes Page</a> has resources that I'll be putting
        as I'm learning. This page outlines my approach to learning Biblical
        Greek. Below are the primary resources I am using, including textbooks,
        lecture series, and tools for practice and reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm working towards reading 1 John initially as the Greek is easier to
        understand and the repetitive vocabulary makes it good for beginners.
        That requires beginning Greek and a little extra vocabulary. My broader
        goal of reading the entire New Testament requires intermediate Greek
        which I'll go over next.

      <h3>Primary Resources</h3>
      <p>
        The grammar I'm using is

          >Beginning with New Testament Greek</a

          target="_blank"
          >Daily Dose of Greek</a

        has free lectures going over the material and other helpful resources.
        Benjamin Merkle and Robert Plummer also have a book called
        <a href="https://a.co/d/7H3Uu1R" target="_blank"

      </p>
      <h3>Overall Approach</h3>
      <p>
        The vocabulary in each section should be mastered. The paradigms should
        be drilled. Don't get stuck on a chapter if it is not quite mastered. Do
        the practice, work on memorizing, but keep moving through the material.
        Some of it will take time to sink in or will make more sense as you
        continue on.

      </p>

      <h2>Intermediate Greek</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Although I'm still learning beginning Greek, I've gone ahead and looked
        into intermediate Greek as well. An intermediate Greek grammar is the
        next step after completing beginning Greek and learning to recognize
        basic forms and syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intermediate Greek moves past a heavy focus on identifying forms to
        understanding their function in greater detail. It introduces more
        advanced concepts such as verbal aspect, clause relationships, and
        discourse features which enables readers to interpret the New Testament
        with greater nuance and accuracy.
      </p>

      <h3>Primary Resources</h3>
      <p>
        The textbook I would get is
        <a href="https://a.co/d/ar5pOdR" target="_blank"
          >Going Deeper with New Testament Greek, Revised Edition: An
          Intermediate Study of the Grammar and Syntax of the New Testament</a
        >
        by Andreas Köstenberger, Benjamin Merkle, and Robert Plummer. This
        grammar is a follow up to <em>Beginning with New Testament Greek</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point you should be reading through the New Testament from
        easier to harder books and learning the vocabulary book by book.
        Biblical Mastery Academy's
        <a href="https://www.biblicalmastery.academy/vocabpack/" target="_blank"
          >Vocab Pack</a
        >
        is a good way to do this. Broadening out your reading past the New
        Testament into the Septuagint and Apostolic Fathers is another good way
        to move forward with your knowledge of Greek.
      </p>

        Another good option is

      <!--
      <h3>Overall Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Below is an outline of the material following the Going Deeper with New
        Testament Greek textbook:
      </p>
      <p><b>Phase 1: Language Foundations and Critical Methodology</b></p>
      <p>
        The Greek Language & Textual Criticism (Chapter 1):Develop a historical
        and linguistic overview of Koine Greek within the broader Hellenistic
        context. Gain foundational skills in New Testament textual criticism,
        including manuscript evidence, textual variants, and critical apparatus
        usage.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 2: Case System Deep Dive</b></p>
      <p>
        Nominative, Vocative & Accusative Cases (Chapter 2): Revisit these core
        cases with refined syntactic categorization. Emphasis on subject
        identification, direct address, and direct object functions, including
        classification of nuanced syntactical uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Genitive Case (Chapter 3): Master the spectrum of genitival
        relationships (possessive, partitive, subjective/objective, etc.).
        Integrate exegesis-based illustrations to appreciate the interpretive
        impact of genitive semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dative Case (Chapter 4): Analyze the roles of the dative, with advanced
        attention to uses such as means/instrumental, sphere, interest
        (advantage/disadvantage), and agency in passive constructions.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 3: Modifiers and Sentence Structure</b></p>
      <p>
        The Article & Adjective (Chapter 5): Examine article usage across
        various syntactical categories (anarthrous, predicate, substantival).
        Discuss attributive constructions, degrees of comparison, and agreement
        patterns with adjectives.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 4: Verb System I – Mood and Modality</b></p>
      <p>
        Verbs: Overview, Subjunctives & Imperatives (Chapter 6): Provide a
        detailed framework of Greek verbs, introducing the subjunctive and
        imperative moods in independent and dependent clauses (hortatory,
        prohibitive, purpose/result clauses).
      </p>
      <p>
        Tense & Verbal Aspect (Chapter 7): Explore the theoretical foundations
        of verbal aspect (perfective, imperfective, stative). Distinguish
        between time and aspect, and analyze the implications for exegesis and
        discourse analysis.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 5: Verb System II – Indicative Tenses in Context</b></p>
      <p>
        Present, Imperfect & Future Indicatives (Chapter 8): Delve into form,
        function, and semantic force of these tenses within the indicative mood.
        Emphasize narrative function, aspectual contrast, and temporal
        reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aorist, Perfect & Pluperfect Indicatives (Chapter 9): Contrast aoristic
        and perfective aspects, examining both active and middle/passive voices.
        Understand pluperfect constructions and their role in narrative
        sequencing.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 6: Participles and Infinitives</b></p>
      <p>
        Participles (Chapter 10): Study syntactic functions (adverbial,
        adjectival, supplementary, periphrastic) and morphological variations
        across tenses and voices. Evaluate participial use in circumstantial and
        attributive roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infinitives (Chapter 11): Categorize infinitival functions
        (complementary, indirect discourse, purpose, result, appositional) and
        analyze clause-level integration using Greek NT examples.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 7: Function Words and Discourse Elements</b></p>
      <p>
        Pronouns, Prepositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs & Particles (Chapter 12):
        Synthesize knowledge of minor parts of speech and their contribution to
        sentence cohesion and nuance. Discuss discourse markers, inferential
        particles, and logical connectors.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 8: Discourse Grammar and Semantic Analysis</b></p>
      <p>
        Sentences, Diagramming & Discourse Analysis (Chapter 13): Learn to
        visually map Greek syntax through sentence diagramming. Introduce
        methods of discourse analysis, tracing flow, emphasis, and cohesion in
        extended passages.
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 9: Lexical Semantics and Word Studies</b></p>
      <p>
        Word Studies (Chapter 14): Equip students with tools for responsible
        word study methodology. Emphasize diachronic and synchronic lexical
        analysis, avoiding fallacies (e.g., etymological fallacy, illegitimate
        totality transfer).
      </p>

      <p><b>Phase 10: Sustaining Greek Proficiency</b></p>
      <p>
        Continuing with Greek (Chapter 15): Develop a plan for lifelong language
        retention and development. Explore Greek reading plans, advanced
        grammars, exegesis tools, and strategies for integrating Greek into
        teaching and ministry.
