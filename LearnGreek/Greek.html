      <h2>Introduction to Greek</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This page outlines my approach to learning Biblical Greek. Below are the
        primary resources I am using, including textbooks, lecture series, and
        tools for practice and reading.
      </p>
      <h3>Primary Resources</h3>
      <p>
        I'm working towards reading 1 John initially. That requires beginning
        greek and then a little bit of vocabulary after that. The grammar I'm
        using is
        <a href="https://a.co/d/fei00XZ" target="_blank"
          >Beginning with New Testament Greek</a
        >
        by Benjamin L Merkle and Robert L. Plummer. The website for the textbook
        <a
          href="https://dailydoseofgreek.com/learn-biblical-greek/"
          target="_blank"
          >Daily Dose of Greek</a
        >
        has free lectures going over the material and other helpful resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an additional place to go over the materials from the book
        besides the author's website:

      <h3>Overall Approach</h3>
      <p>
        The vocabulary in each section should be mastered. The paradigms should
        be drilled. Don't get stuck on a chapter if it is not quite mastered. Do
        the practice, work on memorizing, but keep moving through the material.
        Some of it will take time to sink in or will make more sense as you
        continue on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is an outline of the material following the Beginning with New
        Testament Greek textbook and you can find topic by topic resources on
        the <a href="Notes.html">Notes Page</a>:
      </p>
      <p><b>Phase 1: Foundations</b></p>

      </p>
      <p>
        First & Second Declension Nouns and Articles (Chapters 2–3): Grasp

      <p>Make sure you start memorizing the vocabulary systematically.</p>
      <p><b>Phase 2: Verbal System I – Present Tense Mastery</b></p>
      <p>
        Basics of Greek Verbs (Chapter 4): Understand verb morphology, stems,
        personal endings, and the thematic vowel. Introduction to tense, voice,
        mood framework.
      </p>
      <p>

        various cases to modify nouns and verbs within sentence structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal and Relative Pronouns (Chapter 9): Learn paradigms and
        syntactical roles of personal pronouns (ἐγώ, σύ, αὐτός) and relative
        pronouns (ὅς, ἥ, ὅ).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Phase 4: Verbal System II – Expanding Tenses</b>
      </p>
      <p>

        first (sigmatic) and second (thematic) aorist; practice their indicative
        forms and principal parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liquid Verbs (Chapter 13): Examine phonological changes in verbs with
        stems ending in λ, μ, ν, ρ when forming certain tenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue drilling vocabulary and parsing forms daily. Maintain
        consistent review and parsing practice to reinforce morphology and
        syntax recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Phase 5: Nouns, Adjectives, Participles</b>
      </p>
      <p>

        consonantal stem changes and irregular nominative forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perfect and Pluperfect Verbs (Chapter 15): Explore reduplication,
        perfect active endings, and formation of the pluperfect indicative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adjectives and Adverbs (Chapter 16): Learn agreement rules for
        attributive and predicate adjectives; derivation of adverbs from

      </p>
      <p>
        Aorist and Perfect Participles (Chapters 18–19): Understand principal
        parts and function of participles in attributive and circumstantial
        clauses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Pronouns (Chapter 20): Examine additional pronominal forms beyond
        personal and relative pronouns. Emphasis on declension patterns,
        syntactic function, and translation nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Infinitives (Chapter 21), Subjunctives (Chapter 22), Imperatives &
        Optatives (Chapter 23): Master non-finite verbal forms and their
        syntactical uses in indirect discourse, purpose clauses, and commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        μι-Verbs (Chapter 24): Study the unique paradigms of athematic verbs;
        focus on their complex conjugation patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plan to spend more time for this phase due to inherent irregularity and
        complexity.
