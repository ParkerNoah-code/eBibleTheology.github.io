        <h1>Gospel Indicators</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Romans 1:1-7 lays the foundation for the entire book of Romans, 
          which further expounds on the gospel’s power, meaning, implications, and 
          application. The gospel is not just good advice; it is good 
          news—the message of salvation through Jesus Christ, secured 
          by God, proclaimed to all peoples, and effecting salvation for those who believe. 
          The following are eight markers 
          of this true and saving gospel message:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Apostolic (rooted in divine authority)</li>
            <li>God-centered (focused on His justice and glory)</li>
            <li>Scriptural (in fulfillment of Old Testament promises)</li>
            <li>Christ-centered (about His work and reign)</li>
            <li>Transformative (producing obedience in believers)</li>
            <li>Universally proclaimed (for all peoples and nations)</li>
            <li>Humbling (excluding human boasting)</li>
            <li>Sovereignly accomplished (dependent on God’s mercy)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Apostolic</b> – "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle"
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel is not a human invention but a divine message that comes with the 
          authority of Jesus Christ Himself. The apostles were chosen by God to be His 
          authorized messengers, entrusted with the task of proclaiming and preserving 
          the true gospel. In 1 Corinthians 3:10-11, Paul affirms that Christ is the 
          foundation of the gospel, and the apostles build upon that foundation by faithfully 
          delivering the message. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This divine commission is not something that originates 
          from human wisdom or tradition but is given directly by God, as Paul declares in
          Galatians 1:11-12: "For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was 
          preached by me is not man’s gospel. For I did not receive it from any man, nor was 
          I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ." 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the 
          gospel was "once for all delivered to the saints" (Jude 3), it is not subject to 
          change or human modification. Because of its apostolic nature, any deviation from 
          the original message must be rejected, as Paul warns in Galatians 1:8 that even if 
          an angel from heaven were to preach a different gospel, they would be eternally cut 
          off from Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>God-centered</b> – "Set apart for the Good News of God"
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel is fundamentally about God—His character, His justice, His mercy, and His 
          redemptive purposes in history. It is not primarily about human happiness, self-improvement, 
          or moral guidance but about the glorification of God in the salvation of sinners. 
          Romans 11:36 declares, "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him 
          be glory forever. Amen." 
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel reveals God’s perfect justice, as sin cannot go 
          unpunished, and yet it also displays His grace, as He provides salvation through Jesus 
          Christ. It is God’s plan from eternity past (Ephesians 1:3-6), orchestrated for His glory 
          and carried out according to His sovereign will. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is not about what we do for 
          God but about what He has done for us through Christ. He is both the source and the center 
          of the gospel, and everything it entails—from justification to sanctification to 
          glorification—ultimately points back to Him. As a result, any message that diminishes 
          God’s role and elevates human effort is not the true gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Scriptural</b> – "which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures"
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel is not a new idea but the fulfillment of God’s promises revealed in the Old Testament. 
          Paul explicitly states in Romans 1:2 that the gospel was "promised beforehand through His prophets 
          in the Holy Scriptures." From the very beginning, God had a plan of redemption, first announced in 
          Genesis 3:15, where He promised that the offspring of the woman would crush the serpent’s head. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the Old Testament, numerous prophecies and foreshadowings point to Christ, such as Isaiah 
          53’s depiction of the Suffering Servant, Micah 5:2’s prophecy of the Messiah’s birthplace, and Psalm 
          22’s vivid portrayal of Christ’s crucifixion. Jesus Himself affirmed that He came not to abolish the 
          Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them (Matthew 5:17), and after His resurrection, He explained to 
          His disciples how all Scripture pointed to Him (Luke 24:27). Because of this, the gospel is not an 
          isolated message but one deeply rooted in the entirety of God’s revelation. Any version of the gospel 
          that is not firmly anchored in Scripture is false, as the true gospel is always in alignment with God’s Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Christ-centered</b> – "Concerning his Son, who was born of the offspring of David according to the flesh, 
          who was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, 
          by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord"
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of the gospel is Jesus Christ—His incarnation, sinless life, atoning death, victorious resurrection, 
          and exalted reign. Without Christ, there is no gospel. Philippians 2:6-11 outlines the twofold aspect of Christ’s 
          work: first, His humiliation, where He took on human flesh, suffered, and died on the cross; and second, His 
          exaltation, where He was raised, ascended to heaven, and was given the name above every name. His sacrificial 
          death provides redemption "once for all time" (Hebrews 10:10), satisfying God’s wrath and securing eternal 
          salvation for those who believe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the gospel does not end with His death—it proclaims His resurrection 
          and His current reign at the right hand of God (Romans 8:34). Christ is now King, and He commands all people to 
          repent and believe in Him (Acts 17:30-31). The gospel is not simply about what Jesus did in the past; it also 
          calls us to respond to His present Lordship and eagerly await His return. A Christless gospel is no gospel at all, 
          for only through Him can we be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Transformative</b> – "Through whom we received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith"
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel is not merely a message to be believed but a reality that transforms the lives of those who receive it. 
          Paul speaks of bringing about the "obedience of faith" (Romans 1:5), showing that true faith inevitably leads to a 
          life of obedience to Christ. Salvation is not by works, but it produces good works as its natural fruit (Ephesians 
          2:8-10). Titus 2:11-12 teaches that the grace of God trains believers to renounce ungodliness and live upright, 
          godly lives. Jesus Himself stated, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments" (John 14:15). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith and obedience 
          are inseparable—while obedience does not earn salvation, it is evidence that salvation has taken root in a person’s 
          heart. Any gospel that claims a person can believe in Christ without any resulting change in their life is a distortion
          of the true message. The gospel does not only justify; it also sanctifies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Universally Proclaimed</b> – "Among all the nations"
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel is not confined to one group of people but is a message for the entire world. Jesus’ Great Commission 
          in Matthew 28:18-20 commands His followers to "go and make disciples of all nations." This fulfills God’s promise 
          to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his offspring, which is Christ (Genesis 12:3; Galatians 3:8). 
          Paul affirms in Romans 1:5 that his mission is to bring about the obedience of faith "among all the nations," 
          showing that salvation is not limited by ethnicity or geography. Revelation 7:9-10 paints a glorious picture of 
          people from every tribe, tongue, and nation worshiping Christ. Since the gospel is for all, believers are called 
          to proclaim it boldly to the ends of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Humbling</b> – "For his name’s sake"
        </p>
        <p>
          A key feature of the gospel is that it leaves no room for human boasting. Paul makes this clear in Romans 3:27: 
          "Where then is boasting? It is excluded." Salvation is entirely by grace through faith, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9), 
          so that no one may boast. If salvation depended on human effort, intellect, or moral achievement, then people would 
          have grounds to take credit for their own righteousness. However, the gospel teaches that even faith itself is a gift 
          from God, and everything we receive in Christ is due to His work, not our own. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1 Corinthians 1:29-31, Paul 
          emphasizes that no one can boast before God, for it is by His doing that we are in Christ Jesus. This truth humbles 
          believers, shifting the focus away from self-reliance and toward gratitude and worship of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sovereignly Accomplished</b> – "Beloved of God, called to be saints"
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel magnifies God’s sovereignty in salvation. Romans 9:16 states, "So then it depends not on human will or 
          exertion, but on God, who has mercy." Salvation is not ultimately the result of human choice but of God’s gracious 
          election and calling. Romans 8:29-30 describes how God foreknew, predestined, called, justified, and glorified His 
          people, ensuring that the entire process of salvation is under His sovereign control. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This does not negate human 
          responsibility to repent and believe, but it shows that behind every conversion is the merciful work of God drawing 
          sinners to Himself (John 6:44). As Paul writes in Romans 11:32, God’s mercy is displayed in His redemptive plan
          which glorifies Himself and humbles us. Any message that places ultimate credit for salvation in human hands distorts the gospel 
          and robs God of His rightful glory.
