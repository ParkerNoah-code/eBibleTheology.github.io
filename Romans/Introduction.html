      <h1>Romans 1:1-17</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This passage serves as both an introduction and a thesis statement for
        the entire letter. Paul introduces himself, clarifies his mission,
        expresses his deep desire to visit Rome, and presents the core theme of
        the gospel—justification by faith.
      </p>

      <h3>Romans 1:1-7</h3>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
        set apart for the Good News of God, <sup>2</sup> which he promised
        before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
        <sup>3</sup> concerning his Son, who was born of the offspring of David
        according to the flesh, <sup>4</sup> who was declared to be the Son of
        God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection
        from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, <sup>5</sup> through whom we
        received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith among all the
        nations for his name’s sake; <sup>6</sup> among whom you are also called
        to belong to Jesus Christ; <sup>7</sup> to all who are in Rome, beloved
        of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father
        and the Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <h3>Romans 1:8-15</h3>
      <p>
        <sup>8</sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you,
        that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
        <sup>9</sup> For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the
        Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my
        prayers, <sup>10</sup> requesting, if by any means now at last I may be
        prospered by the will of God to come to you. <sup>11</sup> For I long to
        see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that
        you may be established; <sup>12</sup> that is, that I with you may be
        encouraged in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>13</sup> Now I don’t desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I
        often planned to come to you (and was hindered so far), that I might
        have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
        <sup>14</sup> I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the
        wise and to the foolish. <sup>15</sup> So as much as is in me, I am
        eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome.
      </p>
      <h3>Romans 1:16-17</h3>
      <p>
        <sup>16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, because
        it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the
        Jew first, and also for the Greek. <sup>17</sup> For in it is revealed
        God’s righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, “But the
        righteous shall live by faith.”
      </p>
      <h2>Commentary</h2>
      <h3>Introduction and Greeting (1:1-7)</h3>
      <p>
        The following are eight markers of this true and saving gospel message
        laid out by Paul in the introduction (see
        <a href="GospelIndicators.html">Gospel Indicators</a> for more detail):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apostolic (rooted in divine authority)</li>
        <li>God-centered (focused on His justice and glory)</li>
        <li>Scriptural (in fulfillment of Old Testament promises)</li>
        <li>Christ-centered (about His work and reign)</li>
        <li>Transformative (producing obedience in believers)</li>
        <li>Universally proclaimed (for all peoples and nations)</li>
        <li>Humbling (excluding human boasting)</li>
        <li>Sovereignly accomplished (dependent on God’s mercy)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Thanksgiving and Desire to Visit Rome (1:8-15)</h3>
      <p>
        Paul expresses his deep gratitude to God for the faith of the Roman
        believers, which is being proclaimed throughout the world. He shares his
        constant prayers for them and his strong desire to visit Rome, hoping
        that by God's will he will be able to do so. Paul longs to strengthen
        them spiritually and to be mutually encouraged by their faith. He sees
        his calling as an obligation to preach to all people, especially the
        Gentiles, including both the cultured Greeks and the non-Greek
        "barbarians." He is eager to fulfill this mission by bringing the gospel
        to Rome also, demonstrating his commitment to proclaiming Christ to all,
        regardless of their background.
      </p>

      <h3>Letter Thesis: The Gospel is the Power of God (1:16-17)</h3>
      <p>
        "<em>For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ</em>" — Paul is
        "eager to preach the Good News" (v. 15) because of his unwavering
        confidence in the gospel. Despite the fact that Greeks considered it
        foolishness and Jews a stumbling block, he denies any embarrassment or
        hesitation in proclaiming the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>because it is the power of God for salvation</em>" — Paul's
        confidence comes from the fact that the gospel itself is God's power,
        meaning it actively brings salvation. Salvation is a divine work, and
        the preaching of the gospel is God's ordinary means of calling the elect
        to salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>for everyone who believes</em>" or "<em>to everyone believing</em>"
        — The present active participle ("believing") indicates that true faith
        is an ongoing trust in Christ, not just a one-time decision. This phrase
        underscores Paul’s teaching that justification comes by faith alone
        (sola fide), apart from works of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>for the Jew first, and also for the Greek</em>" — The Jews were the
        first recipients of God’s promises (Rom. 9:4-5).
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>For in it is revealed God’s righteousness</em>" — that is, "the
        righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe"
        in order "to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he
        might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus" (Rom
        3:21, 26). Believers, by virtue of union with Christ through faith, are
        clothed in the righteousness Christ who lived a righteous life on our
        behalf and paid the penalty due our sins on our behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>from faith to faith</em>" — that is, either: 1) the righteousness
        of God for salvation is from faith from start to finish; or 2)
        righteousness comes by means of faith and is intended to produce faith
        in others; or 3) the faith of one leading to faith in another; or 4)
        from one level of faith to a greater level of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>As it is written, 'But the righteous shall live by faith'</em>"
        (Habakkuk 2:4) — In Habakkuk’s historical setting, the prophet is
        encouraging Israel to trust in God's promises rather than relying on
        their own strength, particularly in light of impending judgment
        (Babylonian invasion).
