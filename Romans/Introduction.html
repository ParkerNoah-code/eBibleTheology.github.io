      <h1>Romans 1:1-17</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This passage serves as both an introduction and a thesis statement for
        the entire letter. Paul introduces himself, clarifies his mission,
        expresses his deep desire to visit Rome, and presents the core theme of
        the gospel—justification by faith.
      </p>

      <h3>Romans 1:1-7</h3>
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
        set apart for the Good News of God, <sup>2</sup> which he promised
        before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
        <sup>3</sup> concerning his Son, who was born of the offspring of David
        according to the flesh, <sup>4</sup> who was declared to be the Son of
        God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection
        from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, <sup>5</sup> through whom we
        received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith among all the
        nations for his name’s sake; <sup>6</sup> among whom you are also called
        to belong to Jesus Christ; <sup>7</sup> to all who are in Rome, beloved
        of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father
        and the Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <h3>Romans 1:8-15</h3>
      <p>
        <sup>8</sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you,
        that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
        <sup>9</sup> For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the
        Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my
        prayers, <sup>10</sup> requesting, if by any means now at last I may be
        prospered by the will of God to come to you. <sup>11</sup> For I long to
        see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that
        you may be established; <sup>12</sup> that is, that I with you may be
        encouraged in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup>13</sup> Now I don’t desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I
        often planned to come to you (and was hindered so far), that I might
        have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
        <sup>14</sup> I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the
        wise and to the foolish. <sup>15</sup> So as much as is in me, I am
        eager to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome.
      </p>
      <h3>Romans 1:16-17</h3>
      <p>
        <sup>16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, because
        it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the
        Jew first, and also for the Greek. <sup>17</sup> For in it is revealed
        God’s righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, “But the
        righteous shall live by faith.”
      </p>
      <h2>Commentary</h2>
      <h3>Introduction and Greeting (1:1-7)</h3>
      <p>
        The following are eight markers of this true and saving gospel message
        laid out by Paul in the introduction (see
        <a href="GospelIndicators.html">Gospel Indicators</a> for more detail):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apostolic (rooted in divine authority)</li>
        <li>God-centered (focused on His justice and glory)</li>
        <li>Scriptural (in fulfillment of Old Testament promises)</li>
        <li>Christ-centered (about His work and reign)</li>
        <li>Transformative (producing obedience in believers)</li>
        <li>Universally proclaimed (for all peoples and nations)</li>
        <li>Humbling (excluding human boasting)</li>
        <li>Sovereignly accomplished (dependent on God’s mercy)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Thanksgiving and Desire to Visit Rome (1:8-15)</h3>
      <p>
        Paul expresses his deep gratitude to God for the faith of the Roman
        believers, which is being proclaimed throughout the world. He shares his
        constant prayers for them and his strong desire to visit Rome, hoping
        that by God's will he will be able to do so. Paul longs to strengthen
        them spiritually and to be mutually encouraged by their faith. He sees
        his calling as an obligation to preach to all people, especially the
        Gentiles, including both the cultured Greeks and the non-Greek
        "barbarians." He is eager to fulfill this mission by bringing the gospel
        to Rome also, demonstrating his commitment to proclaiming Christ to all,
        regardless of their background.
      </p>

      <h3>Letter Thesis: The Gospel is the Power of God (1:16-17)</h3>
      <p>
        "<em>For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ</em>" — Paul is
        "eager to preach the Good News" (v. 15) and is unashamed — "<em
          >because it is the power of God for salvation</em
        >" — that is, the gospel itself is God's power to bring about salvation
        — "<em>for everyone who believes</em>" — the present active participle
        "believes" indicates those continually believing in Christ, the word
        brings about a lasting, saving faith — "<em
          >for the Jew first, and also for the Greek</em
        >" — the Jews were the first recipients of God’s promises (Romans
        9:4-5), but the gospel is for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>For in it is revealed God’s righteousness</em>" — that is, the
        gospel reveals the righteousness of God which is counted to those who
        believe through faith — "<em>from faith to faith</em>" — that is, the
        way of salvation by faith revealed in order to be believed — "<em
          >As it is written, 'But the righteous shall live by faith'</em
        >
        or '<em>But the righteous by faith shall live'</em>" — the prophet is
        encouraging Israel to trust in God's promises for life rather than
        relying on their own strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        ChatGPT: Q. Is the "power of God" in Romans 1:16-17 like dynamite? A.
        The phrase "power of God" in Romans 1:16-17 is derived from the Greek
        word δύναμις (dynamis). The modern word dynamite (from Greek δύναμις)
        was coined by Alfred Nobel in the 19th century. Dynamite implies
        destructive, sudden force, whereas dynamis in biblical Greek refers to a
        sustained, transformative power rather than an explosive one. The power
        of God in the Gospel does not obliterate or destroy but transforms
        lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        "<em>from faith to faith</em>" — that is, either: 1) the righteousness
        of God for salvation is from faith from start to finish; or 2)
        righteousness comes by means of faith and is intended to produce faith
        in others; or 3) the faith of one leading to faith in another; or 4)
        from one level of faith to a greater level of faith; or 5) again
        emphasizing that salvation is by faith for Jew and gentile. I think the
        parallel statement in Romans 3:23 disambiguates the phrase: "the
        righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe."
        The righteousness of God which comes from (through) faith for faith
        (belief).

        The power of the gospel message should cause boldness. It is not man's
        wisdom, but God's. It is not man's power, but God's power:
      </p>
      <p>
        1 Corinthians 1:22-24 ESV — "For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek
        wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and
        folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks,
        Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        1 Corinthians 2:1-5 — "When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with
        excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of
        God. For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ
        and him crucified. I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much
        trembling. My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of
        human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your
        faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
      </p>
      <p>
        Salvation is a divine work, and the preaching of the gospel is God's
        ordinary means of calling the elect to salvation:
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 10:8-9, 13-15 — "'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your
        heart;' that is, the word of faith which we preach: that if you will
        confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart
        that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved... For, 'Whoever
        will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.' How then will they
        call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him
        whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher? And how
        will they preach unless they are sent?"
      </p>
      <p>
        James 1:18 — "Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth,
        that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures."
      </p>
      <p>
        1 Peter 1:23, 25 ESV — "since you have been born again, not of
        perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word
        of God... And this word is the good news that was preached to you."
      </p>
      <p>
        Isaiah 55:11 — "so is my word that goes out of my mouth: it will not
        return to me void, but it will accomplish that which I please, and it
        will prosper in the thing I sent it to do."
      </p>
      <p>
        The gospel is not just one aspect of the Christian message; it is of
        "first importance." Paul defines the gospel as the life, death, and
        resurrection of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins according to
        the Scriptures. Evangelism must center on this message:
      </p>
      <p>
        1 Corinthians 15:1-4 — "Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel
        which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand,
        by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached
        to you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all
        that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to
        the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third
        day according to the Scriptures."
