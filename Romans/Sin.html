      <h2>Outline</h2>
      <p><a href="Sin1.html">Romans 1:18-32</a></p>
      <p>
        Paul begins his argument by exposing the sinfulness of the Gentile
        world:
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 1:18 – "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
        ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness
        suppress the truth."
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 1:19-20 – They have knowledge of God through general revelation
        but reject Him.
      </p>
      <p>Romans 1:21-23 – Their rejection leads to idolatry.</p>
      <p>
        Romans 1:24-32 – God gives them over to deeper sin, including sexual
        immorality, dishonorable passions, and a debased mind.
      </p>
      <p><a href="Sin2.html">Romans 2:1-29</a></p>
      <p>
        He then turns to the Jews, showing that they, too, are guilty of sin
        despite having the Law:
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 2:1-5 – Paul rebukes those who judge others while committing the
        same sins. This hypocrisy reveals that their religious identity has not
        led to true transformation. Instead of being exempt from judgment, they
        are storing up God’s wrath against themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 2:6-11 – Paul introduces God’s standard of impartial judgment.
        Both Jews and Gentiles are held to the same standard, emphasizing that
        outward privilege does not guarantee righteousness. This sets the stage
        for his later conclusion that all are guilty before God (Romans 3:9-20).
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 2:12-16 – Gentiles are accountable to the law “written on their
        hearts” while Jews are accountable to the written Law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 2:17-24 – Paul addresses Jews who rely on the Law and boast in
        their special relationship with God. They take pride in their knowledge
        of the Law and their role as guides for the blind, yet they fail to
        practice what they teach. Their hypocrisy dishonors God, leading
        Gentiles to blaspheme His name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romans 2:25-29 – Paul challenges the Jewish belief that physical
        circumcision guarantees righteousness. True circumcision is not outward
        but inward—of the heart, by the Spirit, not merely by the letter of the
        Law. A true Jew is one whose heart is transformed, not just someone with
        an external religious identity. Ultimately, God's praise is for those
        who are inwardly renewed, not merely outwardly observant.
