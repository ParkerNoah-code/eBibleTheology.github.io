      <h1>Romans 1:18-3:20</h1>
      <h2>Outline</h2>
      <p><a href="Sin1.html">Romans 1:18-32</a> – God's Righteous Judgment on Gentile Sin</p>
      <p>
        <b>Humanity stands under divine judgment</b> (1:18): "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
        ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness
        suppress the truth."
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Knowledge rejected</b> (1:19-20): Gentiles possess knowledge of God through creation (natural revelation), making them accountable. This knowledge is sufficient to leave them "without excuse."
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Consequences of rejection</b> (1:21-23): Despite knowing God, they neither glorified Him nor gave thanks. This leads to futile thinking, darkened hearts, and ultimately idolatry—exchanging worship of the Creator for worship of created things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Divine judgment through abandonment</b> (1:24-32): God "gives them over" to dishonorable bodily desires (1:24-25), 
        degrading passions contrary to nature (1:26-27), and a debased mind resulting in all manner of wickedness (1:28-32).
      </p>
      <p><a href="Sin2.html">Romans 2:1-29</a> – The Jews Also Stand Condemned Despite Their Privileges</p>
      <p>
        <b>Judgment applies to all</b> (2:1-5): Paul addresses those who judge others while practicing the same sins. This hypocrisy reveals a failure of true transformation and accumulates God's wrath rather than providing exemption from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>God judges impartially</b> (2:6-11): Those who seek glory, honor, and immortality through patient perseverance in doing good will receive eternal life, while those who reject the truth and follow unrighteousness will face God’s wrath and punishment. Paul highlights that this judgment applies equally to Jews and Gentiles, affirming that no one is privileged by birth or religious heritage—only a life reflecting true faith in God matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Possessing vs. obeying the Law</b> (2:12-16): Paul distinguishes between having the Law and following it. Gentiles who follow the "law written on their hearts" may be more righteous than Jews who possess but disobey the written Law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Religious identity without transformation</b> (2:17-24): Paul challenges Jews who rely on their special status and knowledge of the Law. Their hypocrisy—teaching others while failing to practice these teachings—dishonors God and causes Gentiles to blaspheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>True circumcision is spiritual</b> (2:25-29): Physical circumcision profits nothing without obedience. True Judaism is a matter of inward transformation ("circumcision of the heart") rather than external religious markers. God's approval comes from spiritual renewal, not mere observance of rituals.
      </p>
      <p><a href="Sin3.html">Romans 3:1-3:20</a> – Universal Guilt and the Purpose of the Law</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jewish advantage</b> (3:1-2): Paul acknowledges that Jews were entrusted with "the oracles of God"—a genuine privilege—but this does not exempt them from judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>God's faithfulness despite human failure</b> (3:3-8): Human unfaithfulness does not nullify God's faithfulness. Paul refutes the argument that God is unjust to punish sin if human sin ultimately highlights His righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Universal sinfulness proven</b> (3:9-18): Paul's definitive conclusion: "all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin." He substantiates this with a series of Old Testament quotations demonstrating humanity's complete moral failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Law's true purpose</b> (3:19-20): The Law was given not to provide salvation but to bring knowledge of sin and accountability before God. "By works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight."
