      <h1>Romans 3:21-4:25</h1>
      <h3>Romans 3:21-31</h3>
      <p>
        Romans 3:21-31 is a foundational passage in the Apostle Paul's Epistle
        to the Romans, outlining the doctrine of justification by faith apart
        from works of the Law. It marks a transition from the preceding
        sections, where Paul establishes the universal sinfulness of humanity,
        to the introduction of God's solution to that problem through
        righteousness offered in Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        In verse 21, Paul declares that the righteousness of God has been
        manifested "apart from the law," although it is testified to by the Law
        and the Prophets. This reveals that God's method of making people
        righteous is not through legalistic adherence to the Mosaic Law but
        through a new means, long anticipated in Scripture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Verses 22-24 articulate that this righteousness comes "through faith in
        Jesus Christ for all who believe," emphasizing that there is no
        distinction between Jews and Gentiles in terms of their need or access
        to salvation. All have sinned and fall short of God’s glory, and all are
        justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ
        Jesus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Verse 25 introduces the concept of propitiation: God presented Christ as
        a sacrifice of atonement, by His blood, to be received by faith. This
        reveals both the justice and mercy of God. God’s forbearance in passing
        over former sins is now vindicated through the atoning death of Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        In verse 26, Paul asserts that God is both "just and the justifier" of
        the one who has faith in Jesus. This is crucial, showing that God's
        justice is not compromised in forgiving sinners; rather, His justice is
        upheld through the sacrificial death of Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        Verses 27-28 exclude any possibility of boasting, as justification is
        not based on human works but on faith. Paul declares that a person is
        justified by faith apart from the works of the Law, reinforcing the
        principle of sola fide (faith alone).
      </p>

      <p>
        In verses 29-31, Paul explains that God is not just the God of the Jews,
        but also of the Gentiles. Since there is only one God and one way of
        salvation, salvation comes to all people the same way, through faith.
        Paul then asks whether faith makes the Law meaningless. He strongly
        denies it, saying that faith actually upholds the Law. The purpose of
        the Law was to show people their need for God and to point them toward
        Christ. The moral core of the Law is upheld and even deepened by those
        who walk by faith.
      </p>

      <h3>Romans 4</h3>
      <p>
        Romans 4 continues Paul’s argument that justification comes by faith,
        not by works or adherence to the Law. He uses Abraham as the central
        example to prove this point, showing that even the forefather of the
        Jewish people was justified by faith before he performed any works or
        received circumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
        In verses 1-5, Paul emphasizes that if Abraham had been justified by
        works, he would have had reason to boast. However, Scripture says,
        "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness"
        (Genesis 15:6). This shows that righteousness was given as a gift
        through faith, not earned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Verses 6-8 cite David, who also spoke of the blessedness of the one
        whose sins are forgiven and whose righteousness comes apart from works.
        This supports the idea that justification by faith is not a new concept
        but is rooted in the Old Testament.
      </p>
      <p>
        In verses 9-12, Paul highlights that Abraham was declared righteous
        before he was circumcised. This proves that righteousness by faith is
        not limited to the circumcised (Jews), but is also available to the
        uncircumcised (Gentiles). Abraham becomes the father of all who believe,
        regardless of ethnicity or religious background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Verses 13-17 stress that the promise to Abraham and his descendants did
        not come through the Law but through the righteousness of faith. The Law
        brings awareness of sin and wrath, but faith brings life and grace.
        God’s promise is guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring, those who share
        his faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, in verses 18-25, Paul describes Abraham’s faith as unwavering.
        He believed God's promise even when it seemed impossible because he and
        Sarah were too old to have children. This kind of faith, trust in God's
        power and promises, is counted as righteousness. Paul concludes by
        connecting Abraham’s faith to Christian faith: just as Abraham believed
        in God’s power to give life, we believe in God who raised Jesus from the
        dead. Jesus was delivered over for our sins and raised for our
        justification.
