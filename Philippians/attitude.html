      <h1>Philippians 1:18–26</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        18 τί γάρ; πλὴν ὅτι παντὶ τρόπῳ, εἴτε προφάσει εἴτε ἀληθείᾳ, Χριστὸς
        καταγγέλλεται, καὶ ἐν τούτῳ χαίρω· ἀλλὰ καὶ χαρήσομαι, 19 οἶδα γὰρ ὅτι
        τοῦτό μοι ἀποβήσεται εἰς σωτηρίαν διὰ τῆς ὑμῶν δεήσεως καὶ ἐπιχορηγίας
        τοῦ πνεύματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, 20 κατὰ τὴν ἀποκαραδοκίαν καὶ ἐλπίδα μου
        ὅτι ἐν οὐδενὶ αἰσχυνθήσομαι, ἀλλ’ ἐν πάσῃ παρρησίᾳ ὡς πάντοτε καὶ νῦν
        μεγαλυνθήσεται Χριστὸς ἐν τῷ σώματί μου, εἴτε διὰ ζωῆς εἴτε διὰ θανάτου.
        21 ἐμοὶ γὰρ τὸ ζῆν Χριστὸς καὶ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν κέρδος. 22 εἰ δὲ τὸ ζῆν ἐν
        σαρκί, τοῦτό μοι καρπὸς ἔργου— καὶ τί αἱρήσομαι οὐ γνωρίζω· 23 συνέχομαι
        δὲ ἐκ τῶν δύο, τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν ἔχων εἰς τὸ ἀναλῦσαι καὶ σὺν Χριστῷ εἶναι,
        πολλῷ γὰρ μᾶλλον κρεῖσσον, 24 τὸ δὲ ἐπιμένειν ἐν τῇ σαρκὶ ἀναγκαιότερον
        δι’ ὑμᾶς. 25 καὶ τοῦτο πεποιθὼς οἶδα ὅτι μενῶ καὶ παραμενῶ πᾶσιν ὑμῖν
        εἰς τὴν ὑμῶν προκοπὴν καὶ χαρὰν τῆς πίστεως, 26 ἵνα τὸ καύχημα ὑμῶν
        περισσεύῃ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ διὰ τῆς ἐμῆς παρουσίας πάλιν πρὸς
        ὑμᾶς.

      <h3>English</h3>
      <p>
        18 What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or
        in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will
        rejoice. 19 For I know that this will turn out to my salvation through
        your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 20 according
        to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be
        disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be
        magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me to live
        is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 But if I live on in the flesh, this
        will bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose. 23
        But I am hard pressed between the two, having the desire to depart and
        be with Christ, which is far better. 24 Yet to remain in the flesh is
        more needful for your sake. 25 Having this confidence, I know that I
        will remain, yes, and remain with you all for your progress and joy in
        the faith, 26 that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me
        through my presence with you again.
