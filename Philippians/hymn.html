      <h1>Philippians 2:5–11</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        5 τοῦτο φρονεῖτε ἐν ὑμῖν ὃ καὶ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, 6 ὃς ἐν μορφῇ θεοῦ
        ὑπάρχων οὐχ ἁρπαγμὸν ἡγήσατο τὸ εἶναι ἴσα θεῷ, 7 ἀλλὰ ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσεν
        μορφὴν δούλου λαβών, ἐν ὁμοιώματι ἀνθρώπων γενόμενος· καὶ σχήματι
        εὑρεθεὶς ὡς ἄνθρωπος 8 ἐταπείνωσεν ἑαυτὸν γενόμενος ὑπήκοος μέχρι
        θανάτου, θανάτου δὲ σταυροῦ· 9 διὸ καὶ ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ὑπερύψωσεν, καὶ
        ἐχαρίσατο αὐτῷ τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ὑπὲρ πᾶν ὄνομα, 10 ἵνα ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ
        πᾶν γόνυ κάμψῃ ἐπουρανίων καὶ ἐπιγείων καὶ καταχθονίων, 11 καὶ πᾶσα
        γλῶσσα ἐξομολογήσηται ὅτι κύριος Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς εἰς δόξαν θεοῦ πατρός.

      <h3>English</h3>
      <p>
        5 Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus, 6 who,
        existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing
        to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant,
        being made in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form, he
        humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, yes, the death
        of the cross. 9 Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him
        the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every
        knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the
        earth, 11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
        Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
