      <h1>Philippians 3:12–4:1</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        12 Οὐχ ὅτι ἤδη ἔλαβον ἢ ἤδη τετελείωμαι, διώκω δὲ εἰ καὶ καταλάβω, ἐφ’ ᾧ
        καὶ κατελήμφθην ὑπὸ Χριστοῦ. 13 ἀδελφοί, ἐγὼ ἐμαυτὸν οὐ λογίζομαι
        κατειληφέναι· ἓν δέ, τὰ μὲν ὀπίσω ἐπιλανθανόμενος τοῖς δὲ ἔμπροσθεν
        ἐπεκτεινόμενος, 14 κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκω εἰς τὸ βραβεῖον τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ
        θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ. 15 ὅσοι οὖν τέλειοι, τοῦτο φρονῶμεν· καὶ εἴ τι
        ἑτέρως φρονεῖτε, καὶ τοῦτο ὁ θεὸς ὑμῖν ἀποκαλύψει· 16 πλὴν εἰς ὃ
        ἐφθάσαμεν, τῷ αὐτῷ στοιχεῖν.
      </p>
      <p>
        17 Συμμιμηταί μου γίνεσθε, ἀδελφοί, καὶ σκοπεῖτε τοὺς οὕτω περιπατοῦντας
        καθὼς ἔχετε τύπον ἡμᾶς· 18 πολλοὶ γὰρ περιπατοῦσιν οὓς πολλάκις ἔλεγον
        ὑμῖν, νῦν δὲ καὶ κλαίων λέγω, τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ σταυροῦ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, 19
        ὧν τὸ τέλος ἀπώλεια, ὧν ὁ θεὸς ἡ κοιλία καὶ ἡ δόξα ἐν τῇ αἰσχύνῃ αὐτῶν,
        οἱ τὰ ἐπίγεια φρονοῦντες. 20 ἡμῶν γὰρ τὸ πολίτευμα ἐν οὐρανοῖς ὑπάρχει,
        ἐξ οὗ καὶ σωτῆρα ἀπεκδεχόμεθα κύριον Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν, 21 ὃς
        μετασχηματίσει τὸ σῶμα τῆς ταπεινώσεως ἡμῶν σύμμορφον τῷ σώματι τῆς
        δόξης αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὴν ἐνέργειαν τοῦ δύνασθαι αὐτὸν καὶ ὑποτάξαι αὑτῷ τὰ
        πάντα.
      </p>
      <p>
        1 ὥστε, ἀδελφοί μου ἀγαπητοὶ καὶ ἐπιπόθητοι, χαρὰ καὶ στέφανός μου,
        οὕτως στήκετε ἐν κυρίῳ, ἀγαπητοί.
      </p>

      <h3>English</h3>
      <p>
        12 Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I
        press on, that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold
        of by Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        13 Brothers, I don’t regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one
        thing I do: forgetting the things which are behind and stretching
        forward to the things which are before, 14 I press on toward the goal
        for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. 15 Let us
        therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you
        think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you. 16 Nevertheless, to
        the extent that we have already attained, let’s walk by the same rule.
        Let’s be of the same mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        17 Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this
        way, even as you have us for an example. 18 For many walk, of whom I
        told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the
        cross of Christ, 19 whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly,
        and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things. 20
        For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior,
        the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will change the body of our humiliation to
        be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working by which
        he is able even to subject all things to himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1 Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown,
        stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.
