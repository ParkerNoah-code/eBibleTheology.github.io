      <h1>Philippians 3:7–11</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        7 Ἀλλὰ ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη, ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν. 8 ἀλλὰ
        μενοῦνγε καὶ ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως
        Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ κυρίου μου δι’ ὃν τὰ πάντα ἐζημιώθην, καὶ ἡγοῦμαι
        σκύβαλα ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω 9 καὶ εὑρεθῶ ἐν αὐτῷ, μὴ ἔχων ἐμὴν
        δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐκ νόμου ἀλλὰ τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ, τὴν ἐκ θεοῦ
        δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει, 10 τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τῆς
        ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ καὶ κοινωνίαν παθημάτων αὐτοῦ, συμμορφιζόμενος τῷ
        θανάτῳ αὐτοῦ, 11 εἴ πως καταντήσω εἰς τὴν ἐξανάστασιν τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν.
      </p>

      <h3>English</h3>
      <p>
        7 However, I consider those things that were gain to me as a loss for
        Christ. 8 Yes most certainly, and I count all things to be a loss for
        the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I
        suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that
        I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of
        my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in
        Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith, 10 that I may know
        him and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his
        sufferings, becoming conformed to his death, 11 if by any means I may
        attain to the resurrection from the dead.
