      <h1>Philippians 1:27–2:4</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        27 Μόνον ἀξίως τοῦ εὐαγγελίου τοῦ Χριστοῦ πολιτεύεσθε, ἵνα εἴτε ἐλθὼν
        καὶ ἰδὼν ὑμᾶς εἴτε ἀπὼν ἀκούω τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν, ὅτι στήκετε ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι,
        μιᾷ ψυχῇ συναθλοῦντες τῇ πίστει τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, 28 καὶ μὴ πτυρόμενοι ἐν
        μηδενὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ἀντικειμένων (ἥτις ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς ἔνδειξις ἀπωλείας, ὑμῶν
        δὲ σωτηρίας, καὶ τοῦτο ἀπὸ θεοῦ, 29 ὅτι ὑμῖν ἐχαρίσθη τὸ ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ,
        οὐ μόνον τὸ εἰς αὐτὸν πιστεύειν ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ πάσχειν), 30 τὸν
        αὐτὸν ἀγῶνα ἔχοντες οἷον εἴδετε ἐν ἐμοὶ καὶ νῦν ἀκούετε ἐν ἐμοί.
      </p>
      <p>
        1 Εἴ τις οὖν παράκλησις ἐν Χριστῷ, εἴ τι παραμύθιον ἀγάπης, εἴ τις
        κοινωνία πνεύματος, εἴ τις σπλάγχνα καὶ οἰκτιρμοί, 2 πληρώσατέ μου τὴν
        χαρὰν ἵνα τὸ αὐτὸ φρονῆτε, τὴν αὐτὴν ἀγάπην ἔχοντες, σύμψυχοι, τὸ ἓν
        φρονοῦντες, 3 μηδὲν κατ’ ἐριθείαν μηδὲ κατὰ κενοδοξίαν, ἀλλὰ τῇ
        ταπεινοφροσύνῃ ἀλλήλους ἡγούμενοι ὑπερέχοντας ἑαυτῶν, 4 μὴ τὰ ἑαυτῶν
        ἕκαστοι σκοποῦντες, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ ἑτέρων ἕκαστοι.
      </p>

      <h3>English</h3>
      <p>
        27 Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that
        whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that
        you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of
        the Good News; 28 and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is
        for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from
        God. 29 Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only
        to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf, 30 having the same
        conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
      </p>
      <p>
        1 If therefore there is any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of
        love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and
        compassion, 2 make my joy full by being like-minded, having the same
        love, being of one accord, of one mind; 3 doing nothing through rivalry
        or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than
        himself; 4 each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of
        you also to the things of others.
