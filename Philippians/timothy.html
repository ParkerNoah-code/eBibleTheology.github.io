      <h1>Philippians 2:19–30</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        19 Ἐλπίζω δὲ ἐν κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Τιμόθεον ταχέως πέμψαι ὑμῖν, ἵνα κἀγὼ εὐψυχῶ
        γνοὺς τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν. 20 οὐδένα γὰρ ἔχω ἰσόψυχον ὅστις γνησίως τὰ περὶ
        ὑμῶν μεριμνήσει, 21 οἱ πάντες γὰρ τὰ ἑαυτῶν ζητοῦσιν, οὐ τὰ Ἰησοῦ
        Χριστοῦ. 22 τὴν δὲ δοκιμὴν αὐτοῦ γινώσκετε, ὅτι ὡς πατρὶ τέκνον σὺν ἐμοὶ
        ἐδούλευσεν εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον. 23 τοῦτον μὲν οὖν ἐλπίζω πέμψαι ὡς ἂν
        ἀφίδω τὰ περὶ ἐμὲ ἐξαυτῆς· 24 πέποιθα δὲ ἐν κυρίῳ ὅτι καὶ αὐτὸς ταχέως
        ἐλεύσομαι.
      </p>
      <p>
        25 Ἀναγκαῖον δὲ ἡγησάμην Ἐπαφρόδιτον τὸν ἀδελφὸν καὶ συνεργὸν καὶ
        συστρατιώτην μου, ὑμῶν δὲ ἀπόστολον καὶ λειτουργὸν τῆς χρείας μου,
        πέμψαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς, 26 ἐπειδὴ ἐπιποθῶν ἦν πάντας ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἀδημονῶν διότι
        ἠκούσατε ὅτι ἠσθένησεν. 27 καὶ γὰρ ἠσθένησεν παραπλήσιον θανάτῳ· ἀλλὰ ὁ
        θεὸς ἠλέησεν αὐτόν, οὐκ αὐτὸν δὲ μόνον ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐμέ, ἵνα μὴ λύπην ἐπὶ
        λύπην σχῶ. 28 σπουδαιοτέρως οὖν ἔπεμψα αὐτὸν ἵνα ἰδόντες αὐτὸν πάλιν
        χαρῆτε κἀγὼ ἀλυπότερος ὦ. 29 προσδέχεσθε οὖν αὐτὸν ἐν κυρίῳ μετὰ πάσης
        χαρᾶς, καὶ τοὺς τοιούτους ἐντίμους ἔχετε, 30 ὅτι διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ
        μέχρι θανάτου ἤγγισεν, παραβολευσάμενος τῇ ψυχῇ ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν
        ὑστέρημα τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας.

        19 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also
        may be cheered up when I know how you are doing. 20 For I have no one
        else like-minded, who will truly care about you. 21 For they all seek
        their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. 22 But you know that he has
        proved himself. As a child serves a father, so he served with me in
        furtherance of the Good News. 23 Therefore I hope to send him at once,
        as soon as I see how it will go with me. 24 But I trust in the Lord that
        I myself also will come shortly.

        25 But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother,
        fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need,
        26 since he longed for you all, and was very troubled because you had
        heard that he was sick. 27 For indeed he was sick nearly to death, but
        God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might
        not have sorrow on sorrow. 28 I have sent him therefore the more
        diligently, that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may
        be the less sorrowful. 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all
        joy, and hold such people in honor, 30 because for the work of Christ he
        came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in
        your service toward me.
