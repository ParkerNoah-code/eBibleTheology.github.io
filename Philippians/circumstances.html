      <h1>Philippians 1:12–17</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        12 Γινώσκειν δὲ ὑμᾶς βούλομαι, ἀδελφοί, ὅτι τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ μᾶλλον εἰς
        προκοπὴν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου ἐλήλυθεν, 13 ὥστε τοὺς δεσμούς μου φανεροὺς ἐν
        Χριστῷ γενέσθαι ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ πραιτωρίῳ καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς πᾶσιν, 14 καὶ τοὺς
        πλείονας τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἐν κυρίῳ πεποιθότας τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου περισσοτέρως
        τολμᾶν ἀφόβως τὸν λόγον λαλεῖν.
      </p>
      <p>
        15 Τινὲς μὲν καὶ διὰ φθόνον καὶ ἔριν, τινὲς δὲ καὶ δι’ εὐδοκίαν τὸν
        Χριστὸν κηρύσσουσιν· 16 οἱ μὲν ἐξ ἀγάπης, εἰδότες ὅτι εἰς ἀπολογίαν τοῦ
        εὐαγγελίου κεῖμαι, 17 οἱ δὲ ἐξ ἐριθείας τὸν Χριστὸν καταγγέλλουσιν, οὐχ
        ἁγνῶς, οἰόμενοι θλῖψιν ἐγείρειν τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου.
      </p>

      <h3>English</h3>
      <p>
        12 Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which
        happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News,
        13 so that it became evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the
        rest, that my bonds are in Christ, 14 and that most of the brothers in
        the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to
        speak the word of God without fear. 15 Some indeed preach Christ even
        out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will. 16 The former
        insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add
        affliction to my chains; 17 but the latter out of love, knowing that I
        am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
