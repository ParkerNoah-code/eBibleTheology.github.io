      <h1>Philippians 4:10–20</h1>
      <h3>Greek</h3>
      <p>
        10 Ἐχάρην δὲ ἐν κυρίῳ μεγάλως ὅτι ἤδη ποτὲ ἀνεθάλετε τὸ ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ
        φρονεῖν, ἐφ’ ᾧ καὶ ἐφρονεῖτε ἠκαιρεῖσθε δέ. 11 οὐχ ὅτι καθ’ ὑστέρησιν
        λέγω, ἐγὼ γὰρ ἔμαθον ἐν οἷς εἰμι αὐτάρκης εἶναι· 12 οἶδα καὶ
        ταπεινοῦσθαι, οἶδα καὶ περισσεύειν· ἐν παντὶ καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν μεμύημαι, καὶ
        χορτάζεσθαι καὶ πεινᾶν, καὶ περισσεύειν καὶ ὑστερεῖσθαι· 13 πάντα ἰσχύω
        ἐν τῷ ἐνδυναμοῦντί με. 14 πλὴν καλῶς ἐποιήσατε συγκοινωνήσαντές μου τῇ
        θλίψει.
      </p>
      <p>
        15 Οἴδατε δὲ καὶ ὑμεῖς, Φιλιππήσιοι, ὅτι ἐν ἀρχῇ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, ὅτε
        ἐξῆλθον ἀπὸ Μακεδονίας, οὐδεμία μοι ἐκκλησία ἐκοινώνησεν εἰς λόγον
        δόσεως καὶ λήμψεως εἰ μὴ ὑμεῖς μόνοι, 16 ὅτι καὶ ἐν Θεσσαλονίκῃ καὶ ἅπαξ
        καὶ δὶς εἰς τὴν χρείαν μοι ἐπέμψατε. 17 οὐχ ὅτι ἐπιζητῶ τὸ δόμα, ἀλλὰ
        ἐπιζητῶ τὸν καρπὸν τὸν πλεονάζοντα εἰς λόγον ὑμῶν. 18 ἀπέχω δὲ πάντα καὶ
        περισσεύω· πεπλήρωμαι δεξάμενος παρὰ Ἐπαφροδίτου τὰ παρ’ ὑμῶν, ὀσμὴν
        εὐωδίας, θυσίαν δεκτήν, εὐάρεστον τῷ θεῷ. 19 ὁ δὲ θεός μου πληρώσει
        πᾶσαν χρείαν ὑμῶν κατὰ τὸ πλοῦτος αὐτοῦ ἐν δόξῃ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ. 20 τῷ
        δὲ θεῷ καὶ πατρὶ ἡμῶν ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων· ἀμήν.

      <p>
        10 But I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived
        your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you
        lacked opportunity. 11 Not that I speak because of lack, for I have
        learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it. 12 I know how to be
        humbled, and I also know how to abound. In any and all circumstances I
        have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to
        abound and to be in need. 13 I can do all things through Christ who
        strengthens me. 14 However you did well that you shared in my
        affliction. 15 You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the
        beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly
        shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only. 16
        For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need. 17 Not that
        I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your
        account. 18 But I have all things and abound. I am filled, having
        received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a
        sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to
        God. 19 My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches
        in glory in Christ Jesus. 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory
        forever and ever! Amen.
